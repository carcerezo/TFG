of transactions for the purpose of opera tional readiness in accordance with the provisions of paragraph of the authorization by unanimous vote the committee revised its program for security of fomc information with a set of tech nical changes to update references to other documents in the committees annual reconsideration of the state ment on longerrun goals and monetary policy strat egy participants agreed that only a minor revision was required at this meeting which was to update the refer ence to the median of fomc participants estimates of the longerrun normal rate of unemployment from percent to percent all participants supported the statement with the revision and the committee voted unanimously to approve the updated statement statement on longerrun goals and monetary policy strategy as amended effective january the federal open market committee fomc is firmly committed to fulfilling its statutory mandate from the congress of promoting maximum employment sta ble prices and moderate longterm interest rates the committee seeks to explain its monetary policy deci sions to the public as clearly as possible such clarity facilitates wellinformed decisionmaking by households and businesses reduces economic and financial uncer tainty increases the effectiveness of monetary policy and enhances transparency and accountability which are essential in a democratic society inflation employment and longterm interest rates fluctuate over time in response to economic and finan cial disturbances moreover monetary policy actions tend to influence economic activity and prices with a lag therefore the committees policy decisions reflect its longerrun goals its mediumterm outlook and its as sessments of the balance of risks including risks to the financial system that could impede the attainment of the committees goals the inflation rate over the longer run is primarily de termined by monetary policy and hence the committee has the ability to specify a longerrun goal for inflation the committee reaffirms its judgment that inflation at the rate of percent as measured by the annual change in the price index for personal consumption expendi tures is most consistent over the longer run with the federal reserves statutory mandate the committee would be concerned if inflation were running persis tently above or below this objective communicating this symmetric inflation goal clearly to the public helps keep longerterm inflation expectations firmly anchored thereby fostering price stability and moderate longterm interest rates and enhancing the committees ability to promote maximum employment in the face of signifi cant economic disturbances the maximum level of em ployment is largely determined by nonmonetary factors that affect the structure and dynamics of the labor mar ket these factors may change over time and may not be directly measurable consequently it would not be appropriate to specify a fixed goal for employment ra ther the committees policy decisions must be informed by assessments of the maximum level of employment recognizing that such assessments are necessarily uncer tain and subject to revision the committee considers a wide range of indicators in making these assessments information about committee participants estimates of the longerrun normal rates of output growth and unem ployment is published four times per year in the fomcs summary of economic projections for ex ample in the most recent projections the median of fomc participants estimates of the longerrun normal rate of unemployment was percent in setting monetary policy the committee seeks to mitigate deviations of inflation from its longerrun goal and deviations of employment from the committees as sessments of its maximum level these objectives are generally complementary however under circum stances in which the committee judges that the objec tives are not complementary it follows a balanced ap proach in promoting them taking into account the mag nitude of the deviations and the potentially different time horizons over which employment and inflation are projected to return to levels judged consistent with its mandate page federal open market committee the committee intends to reaffirm these principles and to make adjustments as appropriate at its annual or ganizational meeting each january developments in financial markets and open mar ket operations the manager of the system open market account soma provided a summary of developments in do mestic and global financial markets over the intermeet ing period financial conditions eased further over re cent weeks with market participants pointing to increas ing appetites for risk and perceptions of diminished downside risks as factors buoying market sentiment in this environment yields on safe assets such as us treasury securities moved up some while corporate risk spreads narrowed and equity prices recorded further sig nificant gains breakeven measures of inflation compen sation derived from treasury inflation protected securi ties tips moved up but remained low survey measures of longerterm inflation expectations showed little change judging from interest rate futures the ex pected path of the federal funds rate shifted up over the period but continued to imply a gradual expected pace of policy firming the deputy manager followed with a discussion of recent developments in money markets and fomc operations yearend pressures were evi dent in the market for foreign exchange basis swaps but conditions returned to normal early in yields on treasury bills maturing in early march were elevated re flecting investors concerns about the possibility that a failure to raise the federal debt ceiling could affect the timing of principal payments for these securities the open market desk continued to execute reinvestment operations for treasury and agency securities in the soma in accordance with the procedure specified in the committees directive to the desk the deputy manager also reported on the volume of overnight reverse repur chase agreement operations over the intermeeting pe riod and discussed the desks plans for smallvalue op erational tests of various types of open market opera tions over the coming year by unanimous vote the committee ratified the open market desks domestic transactions over the intermeet ing period there were no intervention operations in foreign currencies for the systems account during the intermeeting period inflation analysis and forecasting the staff presented three briefings on inflation analysis and forecasting the presentations reviewed a number of commonly used structural and reducedform models these included structural models in which the rate of inflation is linked importantly to measures of resource slack and a measure of expected inflation relevant for wage and price settingsocalled phillips curve specifi cationsas well as statistical models in which inflation is primarily determined by a timevarying inflation trend or longerrun inflation expectations the briefings noted several factors beyond those captured in the mod els that appeared to have put downward pressure on prices in recent years these included structural changes in price setting for some items such as medical care and the effects of idiosyncratic price shocks such as the un usual drop in prices of wireless telephone services in the staff found little compelling evidence for the possible influence of other factors such as a more com petitive pricing environment or a change in the markup of prices over unit labor costs overall for the set of models presented the prediction errors in recent years were larger than those observed during the pe riod but were consistent with historical norms and in most models did not appear to be biased the staff presentations considered two key channels by which monetary policy influences inflationthe re sponse of inflation to changes in resource utilization and the role of inflation expectations or trend inflation in the pricesetting process in part because inflation was importantly influenced by a number of shortlived fac tors the effects of current and expected resource utiliza tion gaps on inflation were not easy to discern empiri cally estimates of the strength of those effects had di minished noticeably in recent years the briefings high lighted a number of other challenges associated with es timating the strength and timing of the linkage between resource utilization and inflation including the reliability of and changes over time in estimates of the natural rate of unemployment and potential output and the ability to adequately account for supply shocks in addition some research suggested that the relationship between re source utilization and inflation may be nonlinear with the response of inflation increasing as rates of utilization rise to very high levels with regard to inflation expectations two of the brief ings presented findings that the longerrun trend in in flation absent cyclical disturbances or transitory fluctu ations had been stable in recent years at a little below percent the briefings reported that the average fore casting performance of models employing either statisti cal estimates of inflation trends or surveybased measures of inflation expectations as proxies for infla tion expectations appeared comparable even though different versions of such models could yield very differ minutes of the meeting of january page ent forecasts at any given point in time moreover al though surveybased measures of longerrun inflation expectations tended to move in parallel with estimated inflation trends the empirical research provided no clear guidance on how to construct a measure of inflation ex pectations that would be the most useful for inflation forecasting the staff noted that although reducedform models in which inflation tends to revert toward longer run inflation trends described the data reasonably well those models offered little guidance to policymakers on how to conduct policy so as to achieve their desired out come for inflation following the staff presentations participants discussed how the inflation frameworks reviewed in the briefings informed their views on inflation and monetary policy almost all participants who commented agreed that a phillips curvetype of inflation framework remained useful as one of their tools for understanding inflation dynamics and informing their decisions on monetary policy policymakers pointed to a number of possible reasons for the difficulty in estimating the link between resource utilization and inflation in recent years these reasons included an extended period of low and stable inflation in the united states and other advanced econ omies during which the effects of resource utilization on inflation became harder to identify the shortcomings of commonly used measures of resource gaps the effects of transitory changes in relative prices and structural factors that had made business pricing more competitive or prices more flexible over time it was noted that re search focusing on inflation across us states or metro politan areas continued to find a significant relationship between price or wage inflation and measures of re source gaps a couple of participants questioned the usefulness of a phillips curvetype framework for poli cymaking citing the limited ability of such frameworks to capture the relationship between economic activity and inflation participants generally agreed that inflation expectations played a fundamental role in understanding and forecast ing inflation with stable inflation expectations providing an important anchor for the rate of inflation over the longer run participants acknowledged that the causes of movements in short and longerrun inflation expec tations including the role of monetary policy were im perfectly understood they commented that various proxies for inflation expectationsreadings from household and business surveys or from economic fore casters estimates derived from market prices or esti mated trendswere imperfect measures of actual infla tion expectations which are unobservable that said participants emphasized the critical need for the fomc to maintain a credible longerrun inflation objective and to clearly communicate the committees commitment to achieving that objective several participants indicated that they viewed the available evidence as suggesting that longerrun inflation expectations remained well an chored one cited recent research finding that inflation expectations had become better anchored following the committees adoption of a numerical inflation target however a few saw low levels of inflation over recent years as reflecting in part slippage in longerrun infla tion expectations below the committees percent ob jective in that regard a number of participants noted the importance of continuing to emphasize that the committees percent inflation objective is symmetric a couple of participants suggested that the committee might consider expressing its objective as a range rather than a point estimate a few other participants sug gested that the fomc could begin to examine whether adopting a monetary policy framework in which the committee would strive to make up for past deviations of inflation from target might address the challenge of achieving and maintaining inflation expectations con sistent with the committees inflation objective particu larly in an environment in which the neutral rate of in terest appeared likely to remain low staff review of the economic situation the information reviewed for the january meet ing indicated that labor market conditions continued to strengthen through december and that real gross do mestic product gdp expanded at about a percent pace in the fourth quarter of last year growth of real final domestic purchases by households and businesses generally a good indicator of the economys underlying momentum was solid consumer price inflation as measured by the month percentage change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures pce remained below percent in december surveybased measures of longerrun inflation expecta tions were little changed on balance total nonfarm payroll employment increased solidly in december and the national unemployment rate re mained at percent the unemployment rates for his panics for asians and for african americans were lower than earlier in the year and close to the levels seen just before the most recent recession the national labor force participation rate held steady in december relative to the declining trend suggested by an aging population this sideways movement in the participation rate repre sented a further strengthening in labor market condi tions the participation rate for primeage defined as page federal open market committee ages to men edged up in december while the rate for primeage women declined slightly the share of workers who were employed part time for economic rea sons was little changed in december and was close to its prerecession level the rates of privatesector job openings and quits were little changed in november and the fourweek moving average of initial claims for un employment insurance benefits continued to be at a low level in midjanuary recent readings showed that gains in hourly labor compensation remained modest both the employment cost index for privatesector workers and average hourly earnings for all employees rose about percent over the months ending in december total industrial production increased over the two months ending in december with broadbased gains in manufacturing mining and utilities output automak ers schedules indicated that assemblies of light motor vehicles would likely move up over the coming months broader indicators of manufacturing production such as the new orders indexes from national and regional man ufacturing surveys pointed to further solid increases in factory output in the near term real pce increased strongly in the fourth quarter re cent readings on key factors that influence consumer spendingincluding gains in employment real disposa ble personal income and households net worthcon tinued to be supportive of

briskly in the fourth quarter after having declined in the previous two quar ters both starts and issuance of building permits for new singlefamily homes increased in the fourth quarter as a whole and starts for multifamily units also moved up moreover sales of both new and existing homes rose in the fourth quarter real private expenditures for business equipment and in tellectual property increased at a solid pace in the fourth quarter recent indicators of business equipment spend ingsuch as rising new orders of nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft and upbeat readings on busi ness sentiment from national and regional surveys pointed to further gains in equipment spending in the near term firms real spending for nonresidential struc tures rose modestly in the fourth quarter as an increase in outlays for drilling and mining structures was largely offset by a decline in expenditures for other business structures the number of crude oil and natural gas rigs in operationan indicator of spending for structures in the drilling and mining sectorcontinued to edge up through late january total real government purchases rose modestly in the fourth quarter increased federal government purchases mostly reflected a rise in defense spending and the gains in purchases by state and local governments were led by an increase in construction spending in this sector the nominal us international trade deficit widened fur ther in november after widening sharply in october exports of goods and services picked up in november while imports particularly of consumer goods increased robustly available data for goods trade in december suggested that import growth again outpaced export growth all told real net exports were estimated to be a substantial drag on real gdp growth in

exceeding the more mod erate volume of borrowing observed earlier in the year revolving credit expanded in november while nonre volving credit grew robustly mainly driven by expansion in student and

borrowers conditions remained tight particu larly in the market for credit cards and auto loans the staff provided its latest report on the potential risks to financial stability the report continued to characterize the financial vulnerabilities of the us financial system as moderate on balance this overall assessment incor porated the staffs judgment that vulnerabilities associ ated with asset valuation pressures continued to be ele vated asset valuation pressures apparently reflected in part a broadbased appetite for risk among investors the staff judged that vulnerabilities from leverage in the nonfinancial sector appeared to remain moderate while vulnerabilities stemming from financialsector leverage and from maturity and liquidity transformation contin ued to be viewed as low staff economic outlook the us economic projection prepared by the staff for the january fomc meeting was stronger than the staff forecast at the time of the december meeting real gdp was estimated to have risen in the fourth quarter of last year by somewhat more than the staff had previ ously expected as gains in both household and business spending were larger than anticipated beyond the forecast for real gdp growth was revised up reflecting a reassessment of the recently enacted tax cuts along with higher projected paths for equity prices and foreign economic growth and a lower assumed path for the for eign exchange value of the dollar real gdp was pro jected to increase at a somewhat faster pace than poten tial output through the staff continued to assume that the recently enacted tax cuts would boost real gdp growth moderately over the medium term the unem ployment rate was projected to decline further over the next few years and to continue to run well below the staffs estimate of its longerrun natural rate over this pe riod estimates of total and core pce price inflation for were in line with the staffs previous forecast the pro jection for inflation over the medium term was revised up slightly primarily reflecting tighter resource utiliza tion in the january forecast total pce price inflation in was projected to be somewhat faster than in despite a slower projected pace of increases in con sumer energy prices core pce prices were forecast to rise notably faster in importantly reflecting both the expected waning of transitory factors that held down month measures of inflation in as well as the projected further tightening in resource utilization the staff projected that core inflation would reach percent in and that total inflation would be at the commit tees percent objective in the staff viewed the uncertainty around its projections for real gdp growth the unemployment rate and infla tion as similar to the average of the past years on the one hand many indicators of uncertainty about the macroeconomic outlook remained subdued on the other hand considerable uncertainty remained about a number of federal government policies relevant for the economic outlook the staff saw the risks to the fore casts for real gdp growth and the unemployment rate minutes of the meeting of january page as balanced the risks to the projection for inflation also were seen as balanced downside risks included the pos sibilities that longerterm inflation expectations may have edged lower or that the run of soft core inflation readings this year could prove to be more persistent than the staff expected these downside risks were seen as essentially counterbalanced by the upside risk that infla tion could increase more than expected in an economy that was projected to move further above its potential participants views on current conditions and the economic outlook in their discussion of the economic situation and the outlook meeting participants agreed that information received since the fomc met in december indicated that the labor market continued to strengthen and that economic activity expanded at a solid rate gains in em ployment household spending and business fixed in vestment were solid and the unemployment rate stayed low on a month basis both overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy continued to run below percent marketbased measures of in flation compensation increased in recent months but re mained low surveybased measures of longerterm in flation expectations were little changed on balance participants generally saw incoming information on eco nomic activity and the labor market as consistent with continued abovetrend economic growth and a further strengthening in labor market conditions with the recent solid gains in household and business spending indicat ing substantial underlying economic momentum they pointed to accommodative financial conditions the re cently enacted tax legislation and an improved global economic outlook as factors likely to support economic growth over coming quarters participants expected that with further gradual adjustments in the stance of mone tary policy economic activity would expand at a moder ate pace and labor market conditions would remain strong nearterm risks to the economic outlook ap peared roughly balanced inflation on a month basis was expected to move up this year and to stabilize around the committees percent objective over the medium term however participants judged that it was important to continue to monitor inflation develop ments closely participants expected the recent solid growth in con sumer spending to continue supported by further gains in employment and income increased household wealth resulting from higher asset prices and high levels of con sumer confidence it was noted that spending on dura ble goods to replace those damaged during the hurri canes in september may have provided a temporary boost to consumer spending in connection with solid growth in consumer spending a couple of participants noted that the household saving rate had declined to its lowest level since likely driven by buoyant con sumer sentiment or expectations that the rise in house hold wealth would be sustained participants characterized their business contacts as gen erally upbeat about the economy their contacts cited the recent tax cuts and notable improvements in the global economic outlook as positive factors manufacturers in a number of districts had responded to increased orders by boosting production against a backdrop of higher energy prices and increased global demand for crude oil a couple of participants revised up their forecasts for en ergy production in their respective districts businesses in a number of districts reported plans to further in crease investment in coming quarters in order to expand capacity even so several participants expressed con siderable uncertainty about the degree to which changes to corporate taxes would support business investment and capacity expansion according to these participants firms may be only just beginning to determine how they might allocate their tax savings among investment worker compensation mergers and acquisitions returns to shareholders or other uses the labor market had strengthened further in recent months as indicated by continued solid payroll gains a small increase in average hours worked and a labor force participation rate that had held steady despite the longer run declining trend implied by an aging population many participants reported that labor market conditions were tight in their districts evidenced by low unemploy ment rates difficulties for employers in filling open po sitions or retaining workers or some signs of upward pressure on wages the unemployment rate at per cent had remained near the lowest level seen in the past years it was noted that other labor market indica torssuch as the u measure of unemployment or the share of involuntary parttime employmenthad re turned to their prerecession levels a few participants judged that while the labor market was close to full em ployment some margins of slack remained these partic ipants pointed to the employmenttopopulation ratio or the labor force participation rate for primeage workers which remained below prerecession levels as well as the absence to date of clear signs of a pickup in aggregate wage growth page federal open market committee during their discussion of labor market conditions par ticipants expressed a range of views about recent wage developments while some participants heard more re ports of wage pressures from their business contacts over the intermeeting period participants generally noted few signs of a broadbased pickup in wage growth in available data with regard to how firms might use part of their tax savings to boost compensation a few participants suggested that such a boost could be in the form of onetime bonuses or variable pay rather than a permanent increase in wage structures it was noted that the pace of wage gains might not increase appreciably if productivity growth remains low that said a number of participants judged that the continued tightening in labor markets was likely to translate into faster wage in creases at some point in their discussion of inflation developments many par ticipants noted that inflation data in recent months had generally pointed to a gradual rise in inflation as the month core pce price inflation rose to percent in december up percentage point from the low rec orded in the summer meanwhile total pce price infla tion was percent over the same month period participants anticipated that inflation would continue to gradually rise as resource utilization tightened further and as wage pressures became more apparent several expected that declines in the foreign exchange value of the dollar in recent months would also likely help return inflation to percent over the medium term business contacts in a few districts reported that they had begun to have some more ability to raise prices to cover higher input costs that said a few participants posited that the recently enacted corporate tax cuts might lead firms to cut prices in order to remain competitive or to gain mar ket share which could result in a transitory drag on in flation with regard to inflation expectations available readings from surveys had been steady and tipsbased measures of inflation compensation had moved up although they remained low many participants thought that inflation expectations remained well anchored and would support the gradual return of inflation to the committees per cent objective over the medium term however a few other participants pointed to the record of inflation con sistently running below the committees percent ob jective over recent years and expressed the concern that longerrun inflation expectations may have slipped be low levels consistent with that objective many participants noted that financial conditions had eased significantly over the intermeeting period these participants generally viewed the economic effects of the decline in the dollar and the rise in equity prices as more than offsetting the effects of the increase in nominal treasury yields one participant reported that financial market contacts did not see the relatively flat slope of the yield curve as signaling an increased risk of recession a few others judged that it would be important to continue to monitor the effects of policy firming on the slope of the yield curve noting the strong association between past yield curve inversions and recessions regulatory actions and improved risk management in re cent years had put the financial system in a better posi tion to withstand adverse shocks such as a substantial decline in asset prices than in the past however amid elevated asset valuations and an increased use of debt by nonfinancial corporations several participants cautioned that imbalances in financial markets may begin to emerge as the economy continued to operate above po tential in this environment increased use of leverage by nonbank financial institutions might be difficult to detect in a timely manner it was also noted that the committee should regularly reassess risks to the finan cial system and their implications for the economic out look in light of the potential for changes in regulatory policies over time in their consideration of monetary policy participants discussed the implications of recent economic and finan cial developments for the outlook for economic growth labor market conditions and inflation and in turn for the appropriate path of the federal funds rate partici pants agreed that a gradual approach to raising the target range for the federal funds rate remained appropriate and reaffirmed that adjustments to the policy path would depend on their assessments of how the economic out look and risks to the outlook were evolving relative to the committees policy objectives while participants continued to expect economic activity to expand at a moderate pace over the medium term they anticipated that the rate of economic growth in would exceed their estimates of its sustainable longerrun pace and that labor market conditions would strengthen further a number of participants indicated that they had marked up their forecasts for economic growth in the near term relative to those made for the december meeting in light of the strength of recent data on economic activity in the united states and abroad continued accommodative fi nancial conditions and information suggesting that the effects of recently enacted tax changeswhile still un certainmight be somewhat larger in the near term than previously thought several others suggested that the minutes of the meeting of january page upside risks to the nearterm outlook for economic ac tivity may have increased a majority of participants noted that a stronger outlook for economic growth raised the likelihood that further gradual policy firming would be appropriate almost all participants continued to anticipate that infla tion would move up to the committees percent ob jective over the medium term as economic growth re mained above trend and the labor market stayed strong several commented that recent developments had in creased their confidence in the outlook for further pro gress toward the committees percent inflation objec tive a couple noted that a stepup in the pace of eco nomic growth could tighten labor market conditions even more than they currently anticipated posing risks to inflation and financial stability associated with sub stantially overshooting full employment however some participants saw an appreciable risk that inflation would continue to fall short of the committees objec tive these participants saw little solid evidence that the strength of economic activity and the labor market was showing through to significant wage or inflation pres sures they judged that the committee could afford to be patient in deciding whether to increase the target range for the federal funds rate in order to support fur ther strengthening of the labor market and allow partic ipants to assess whether incoming information on infla tion showed that it was solidly on a track toward the committees objective some participants also commented on the likely evolu tion of the neutral federal funds rate by most estimates the neutral level of the federal funds rate had been very low in recent years but it was expected to rise slowly over time toward its longerrun level however the out look for the neutral rate was uncertain and would de pend on the interplay of a number of forces for exam ple the neutral rate which appeared to have fallen sharply during the global financial crisis when financial headwinds had restrained demand might move up more than anticipated as the global economy strengthened alternatively the longerrun level of the neutral rate might remain low in the absence of fundamental shifts in trends in productivity demographics or the demand for safe assets committee policy action in their discussion of monetary policy for the period ahead members judged that information received since the committee met in december indicated that the labor market had continued to strengthen and that economic activity had been rising at a solid rate gains in employ ment household spending and business fixed invest ment had been solid and the unemployment rate had stayed low on a month basis both overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy had continued to run below percent marketbased measures of inflation compensation had increased in re cent months but remained low surveybased measures of longerterm inflation expectations were little changed on balance members expected that with further gradual adjust ments in the stance of monetary policy economic activ ity would expand at a moderate pace and labor market conditions would remain strong in their discussion of the economic outlook most members viewed the recent data bearing on real economic activity as suggesting a modestly stronger nearterm outlook than they had an ticipated at their meeting in december in addition fi nancial conditions had remained accommodative and the details of the tax legislation suggested that its effects on consumer and business spendingwhile still uncer tainmight be a bit greater in the near term than they had previously thought although several saw increased upside risks to the nearterm outlook for economic ac tivity members generally continued to judge the risks to that outlook as remaining roughly balanced most members noted that recent information on infla tion along with prospects for a continued solid pace of economic activity provided support for the view that in flation on a month basis would likely move up in and stabilize around the committees percent ob jective over the medium term however a couple of members expressed concern about the outlook for infla tion seeing little evidence of a meaningful improvement in the underlying trend in inflation measures of inflation expectations or wage growth several members com mented that they saw both upside and downside risks to the inflation outlook and members agreed to continue to monitor inflation developments closely after assessing current conditions and the outlook for economic activity the labor market and inflation mem bers voted to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at to percent they indicated that the stance of monetary policy remained accommodative thereby supporting strong labor market conditions and a sustained return to percent inflation members agreed that the timing and size of future ad justments to the target range for the federal funds rate would depend on their assessments of realized and ex pected economic conditions relative to the committees page federal open market committee objectives of maximum employment and percent in flation they reiterated that this assessment would take into account a wide range of information including measures of labor market conditions indicators of infla tion pressures and inflation expectations and readings on financial and international developments members also agreed to carefully monitor actual and expected in flation developments relative to the committees sym metric inflation goal members expected that economic conditions would evolve in a manner that would warrant further gradual increases in the federal funds rate they judged that a gradual approach to raising the target range would sustain the economic expansion and balance the risks to the outlook for inflation and unemployment members agreed that the strengthening in the nearterm economic outlook increased the likelihood that a gradual upward trajectory of the federal funds rate would be ap propriate they therefore agreed to update the charac terization of their expectation for the evolution of the federal funds rate in the postmeeting statement to point to further gradual increases while maintaining the tar get range at the current meeting members continued to anticipate that the federal funds rate would likely remain for some time below levels that were expected to prevail in the longer run nonetheless they again stated that the actual path for the federal funds rate would depend on the economic outlook as informed by the incoming data at the conclusion of the discussion the committee voted to authorize and direct the federal reserve bank of new york until it was instructed otherwise to exe cute transactions in the soma in accordance with the following domestic policy directive to be released at pm effective february the federal open market committee directs the desk to under take open market operations as necessary to maintain the federal funds

financial markets and open mar ket operations the deputy manager of the system open market ac count soma provided a summary of developments in domestic and global financial markets over the inter meeting period she also reported on open market oper ations and related issues financial markets experienced a notable bout of volatility early in the intermeeting pe riod volatility was particularly pronounced in equity markets market participants pointed to incoming eco nomic data released in early februaryparticularly data on average hourly earningsas raising concerns about the prospects for higher inflation and higher interest rates these concerns reportedly contributed to a steep decline in equity prices and an associated rise in measures of volatility some reports suggested that the increase in volatility was amplified by the unwinding of trading positions based on various types of volatility trading strategies measures of equity market volatility declined over subsequent weeks but remained above lev els that prevailed earlier in the year and stock prices fin ished lower on net over the intermeeting period inter est rates rose modestly over the period respondents to the open market desks surveys of primary dealers and market participants suggested that revisions in investors views regarding the fiscal outlook were an important fac tor boosting yields and contributing to a slightly steeper expected trajectory of the federal funds rate the deputy manager noted that a rapid and sizable increase in treas ury bill issuance over recent weeks had put upward pres sure on money market yields over the period three month treasury bill yields moved up significantly and those increases passed through to rates on other short term instruments such as threemonth eurodollar de posits and commercial paper the spread of market rates on overnight repurchase agreements over the of fering rate at the federal reserves overnight reverse re purchase on rrp facility widened and takeup at the facility fell to quite low levels as a result rates on over night federal funds and eurodollar transactions edged higher relative to the interest rate on excess reserves the desk continued to execute the fomcs balance sheet normalization plan initiated in october of last year by unanimous vote the committee ratified the open market desks domestic transactions over the intermeeting period there were no intervention operations in foreign currencies for the systems account during the intermeeting period staff review of the economic situation the information reviewed for the march meeting indicated that labor market conditions continued to strengthen through february and suggested that real gross domestic product gdp was rising at a moderate pace in the first quarter consumer price inflation as measured by the month percentage change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures pce remained below percent in january surveybased measures of longerrun inflation expecta tions were little changed on balance gains in total nonfarm payroll employment were strong over the two months ending in february the labor force participation rate held steady in january and then stepped up markedly in february with the participation page federal open market committee rates for primeage defined as ages to women and men moving up on net the national unemployment rate remained at percent similarly the unemploy ment rates for african americans asians and hispanics were roughly flat on balance in recent months the share of workers employed part time for economic rea sons edged up but remained close to its prerecession levels the rates of privatesector job openings and quits increased slightly on net over the two months ending in january and the fourweek moving average of initial claims for unemployment insurance benefits continued to be low in early march recent readings showed that increases in labor compensation remained modest compensation per hour in the nonfarm business sector advanced percent over the four quarters of last year and average hourly earnings for all employees rose percent over the months ending in february total industrial production expanded on net in january and february with gains in both manufacturing and mining automakers schedules indicated that assem blies of light motor vehicles would likely edge down in coming months however broader indicators of manu facturing production such as the new orders indexes from national and regional manufacturing surveys pointed to further solid increases in factory output in the near term consumer expenditures appeared likely to rise at a mod est pace in the first quarter following a strong gain in the preceding quarter real pce edged down in january and the components of the nominal retail sales data used by the bureau of economic analysis to construct its es timate of pce rose somewhat in february while the pace of light motor vehicle sales declined slightly however household spending was probably held back somewhat in february because of a delay in many federal tax re funds and the subsequent delivery of those refunds would likely contribute to an increase in consumer spending in march moreover the lower tax withhold ing resulting from the tax cuts enacted late last year which was beginning to show through in consumers paychecks would likely provide some impetus to spend ing in coming months more broadly recent readings on key factors that influence consumer spendingin cluding gains in employment and real disposable per sonal income along with households elevated net worthcontinued to be supportive of solid real pce growth in the near term in addition consumer senti ment in early march as measured by the university of michigan surveys of consumers was at its highest level since real residential investment looked to be slowing in the first quarter after rising briskly in the fourth quarter starts of new singlefamily homes increased in january and february although building permit issuance moved down somewhat starts of multifamily units jumped in january but fell back in february sales of both new and existing homes declined in january growth in real private expenditures for business equip ment and intellectual property appeared to be moderat ing in the first quarter after increasing at a solid pace in the preceding quarter nominal shipments of nonde fense capital goods excluding aircraft edged down in jan uary however recent forwardlooking indicators of business equipment spendingsuch as the backlog of unfilled capital goods orders along with upbeat readings on business sentiment from national and regional sur veyspointed to further solid gains in equipment spending in the near term firms nominal spending for nonresidential structures outside of the drilling and min ing sector declined in january in contrast the number of crude oil and natural gas rigs in operationan indica tor of business spending for structures in the drilling and mining sectorcontinued to move up through mid march total real government purchases seemed to be flattening out on balance in the first quarter after rising solidly in the fourth quarter nominal defense spending in janu ary and february was consistent with a decline in real federal purchases in contrast real purchases by state and local governments looked to be rising as the pay rolls of these governments increased in january and feb ruary and nominal state and local construction spending advanced somewhat in january the change in net exports was a

the transition period of the brexit process but the pound still ended the intermeeting period modestly weaker against the dollar staff economic outlook the staff projection for us economic activity prepared for the march fomc meeting was somewhat stronger on balance than the forecast at the time of the january meeting the nearterm forecast for real gdp growth was revised down a little the incoming spending data were a bit softer than the staff had expected and the staff judged that the softness was not associated with re sidual seasonality in the data however the slowing in the pace of spending in the first quarter was expected to be transitory and the mediumterm projection for gdp growth was revised up modestly largely reflecting the expected boost to gdp from the federal budget agree ment enacted in february real gdp was projected to increase at a faster pace than potential output through the unemployment rate was projected to decline further over the next few years and to continue to run below the staffs estimate of its longerrun natural rate over this period the projection for inflation over the medium term was revised up a bit reflecting the slightly tighter resource utilization in the new forecast the rates of both total and core pce price inflation were projected to be faster in than in the staff projected that inflation would reach the committees percent objective in the staff viewed the uncertainty around its projections for real gdp growth the unemployment rate and infla tion as similar to the average of the past years the staff saw the risks to the forecasts for real gdp growth and the unemployment rate as balanced on the upside recent fiscal policy changes could lead to a greater ex pansion in economic activity over the next few years than the staff projected on the downside those fiscal policy changes could yield less impetus to the economy than the staff expected if the economy was already op erating above its potential level and resource utilization continued to tighten as the staff projected risks to the inflation projection also were seen as balanced an up side risk was that inflation could increase more than ex pected in an economy that was projected to move fur ther above its potential downside risks included the possibilities that longerterm inflation expectations may have edged lower or that the run of low core inflation readings last year could prove to be more persistent than the staff expected minutes of the meeting of march page participants views on current conditions and the economic outlook in conjunction with this fomc meeting members of the board of governors and federal reserve bank pres idents submitted their projections of the most likely out comes for real gdp growth the unemployment rate and inflation for each year from through and over the longer run based on their individual assess ments of the appropriate path for the federal funds rate the longerrun projections represented each partici pants assessment of the rate to which each variable would be expected to converge over time under appro priate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy these projections and policy assessments are described in the summary of economic projections sep which is an addendum to these minutes in their discussion of economic conditions and the out look meeting participants agreed that information re ceived since the fomc met in january indicated that economic activity had been rising at a moderate rate and that the labor market had continued to strengthen job gains had been strong in recent months and the unem ployment rate had stayed low on a month basis both overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy continued to run below percent marketbased measures of inflation compensation had increased in recent months but remained low survey based measures of longerterm inflation expectations were little changed on balance participants noted incoming data suggesting some slow ing in the rate of growth of household spending and business fixed investment after strong fourthquarter readings however they expected that the firstquarter softness would be transitory pointing to a variety of fac tors including delayed payment of some personal tax re funds residual seasonality in the data and more gener ally to strong economic fundamentals among the fun damentals that participants cited were high levels of con sumer and business sentiment supportive financial con ditions improved economic conditions abroad and re cent changes in fiscal policy participants generally saw the news on spending and the labor market over the past few quarters as being consistent with continued above trend growth and a further strengthening in labor mar kets participants expected that with further gradual in creases in the federal funds rate economic activity would expand at a solid rate during the remainder of this year and a moderate pace in the medium term and that labor market conditions would remain strong inflation on a month basis was expected to move up in coming months and to stabilize around the committees per cent objective over the medium term several partici pants noted that the month pce price inflation rate would likely shift upward when the march data are re leased because the effects of the outsized decline in the prices of cell phone service plans in march of last year will drop out of that calculation nearterm risks to the economic outlook appeared to be roughly balanced but participants agreed that it would be important to con tinue to monitor inflation developments closely many participants reported considerable optimism among the business contacts in their districts consistent with a firming in business expenditures respondents to district surveys in both the manufacturing and service sectors were generally upbeat about the economic out look in some districts reports from business contacts or evidence from surveys pointed to continuing short ages of workers in segments of the labor market activ ity in the energy sector continued to expand with con tacts suggesting that further increases were likely pro vided that sufficient labor resources were forthcoming in contrast contacts in the agricultural sector reported that farm income continued to experience downward pressure due to low crop prices a number of participants reported concern among their business contacts about the possible ramifications of the recent imposition of tariffs on imported steel and alumi num participants did not see the steel and aluminum tariffs by themselves as likely to have a significant effect on the national economic outlook but a strong majority of participants viewed the prospect of retaliatory trade actions by other countries as well as other issues and uncertainties associated with trade policies as downside risks for the us economy contacts in the agricultural sector reported feeling particularly vulnerable to retalia tion tax changes enacted late last year and the recent federal budget agreement taken together were expected to pro vide a significant boost to output over the next few years however participants generally regarded the magnitude and timing of the economic effects of the fis cal policy changes as uncertain partly because there have been few historical examples of expansionary fiscal pol icy being implemented when the economy was operating at a high level of resource utilization a number of par ticipants also suggested that uncertainty about whether all elements of the tax cuts would be made permanent or about the implications of higher budget deficits for fiscal sustainability and real interest rates represented sources of downside risk to the economic outlook a page federal open market committee few participants noted that the changes in tax policy could boost the level of potential output most participants described labor market conditions as strong noting that payroll gains had remained well above the pace regarded as consistent with absorbing new labor force entrants over time the unemployment rate had stayed low job openings had been high or that initial claims for unemployment insurance benefits had been low many participants observed that the labor force participation rate had been higher recently than they had expected helping to keep the unemployment rate flat over the past few months despite strong payroll gains the firmness in the overall participation rate relative to its demographically driven downward trend and the rising participation rate of primeage adults were regarded as signs of continued strengthening in labor market conditions a few participants thought that these favorable developments could continue for a time whereas others expressed doubts a few participants warned against inferring too much from comparisons of the current low level of the unemployment rate with his torical benchmarks arguing that the much higher levels of education of todays workforceand the lower aver age unemployment rate of more highly educated work ers than less educated workerssuggested that the us economy might be able to sustain lower unemployment rates than was the case in the s or s in some districts reports from business contacts or ev idence from surveys pointed to a pickup in wages par ticularly for unskilled or entrylevel workers however business contacts or national surveys led a few partici pants to conclude that some businesses facing labor shortages were changing job requirements so that they matched more closely the skills of available workers in creasing training or offering more flexible work arrange ments rather than increasing wages in a broadbased fashion regarding wage growth at the national level several participants noted a modest increase but most still described the pace of wage gains as moderate a few participants cited this fact as suggesting that there was room for the labor market to strengthen somewhat fur ther in some districts surveys or business contacts reported increases in nonwage costs particularly in the cost of materials and in a few districts contacts reported pass ing on some of those costs in the form of higher prices contacts in a few districts suggested that widely known observable cost increasessuch as those associated with rising commodity priceswould be more likely to be ac cepted and passed through to final goods prices than would less observable costs such as wage increases a few participants argued that either an absence of pricing power among at least some firmsperhaps stemming from globalization and technological innovations in cluding ones that facilitate price comparisonsor the ability of firms to find ways to cut costs of production has been damping inflationary pressures many partici pants stated that recent readings from indicators on in flation and inflation expectations increased their confi dence that inflation would rise to the committees per cent objective in coming months and then stabilize around that level others suggested that downside risks to inflation were subsiding in contrast a few partici pants cautioned that despite increases in marketbased measures of inflation compensation in recent months and the stabilization of some survey measures of infla tion expectations the levels of these indicators remained too low to be consistent with the committees percent inflation objective in their discussion of developments in financial markets some participants observed that financial conditions re mained accommodative despite the rise in market vola tility and repricing of assets that had occurred in febru ary many participants reported that their contacts had taken the previous months turbulence in stride al though a few participants suggested that financial devel opments over the intermeeting period highlighted some downside risks associated with stillhigh valuations for equities or from market volatility more generally a few participants expressed concern that a lengthy period in which the economy operates beyond potential and fi nancial conditions remain highly accommodative could over time pose risks to financial stability in their consideration of monetary policy participants discussed the implications of recent economic and finan cial developments for the appropriate path of the federal funds rate all participants agreed that the outlook for the economy beyond the current quarter had strength ened in recent months in addition all participants ex pected inflation on a month basis to move up in com ing months this expectation partly reflected the arith metic effect of the soft readings on inflation in early dropping out of the calculation it was noted that the increase in the inflation rate arising from this source was widely expected and by itself would not justify a change in the projected path for the federal funds rate most participants commented that the stronger eco nomic outlook and the somewhat higher inflation read ings in recent months had increased the likelihood of progress toward the committees percent inflation ob jective a few participants suggested that a modest in minutes of the meeting of march page flation overshoot might help push up longerterm infla tion expectations and anchor them at a level consistent with the committees percent inflation objective a number of participants offered their views on the poten tial benefits and costs associated with an economy oper ating well above potential for a prolonged period while inflation remained low on the one hand the associated tightness in the labor market might help speed the return of inflation to the committees percent goal and in duce a further increase in labor force participation on the other hand an overheated economy could result in significant inflation pressures or lead to financial insta bility based on their current assessments almost all partici pants expressed the view that it would be appropriate for the committee to raise the target range for the federal funds rate basis points at this meeting these partic ipants agreed that even after such an increase in the tar get range the stance of monetary policy would remain accommodative supporting strong labor market condi tions and a sustained return to percent inflation a couple of participants pointed to possible benefits of postponing an increase in the target range for the federal funds rate until a subsequent meeting these participants suggested that waiting for additional data to provide more evidence of a sustained return of the month in flation rate to percent might more clearly demonstrate the data dependence of the committees decisions and its resolve to achieve the pricestability component of its dual mandate with regard to the mediumterm outlook for monetary policy all participants saw some further firming of the stance of monetary policy as likely to be warranted al most all participants agreed that it remained appropriate to follow a gradual approach to raising the target range for the federal funds rate several participants com mented that this gradual approach was most likely to be conducive to maintaining strong labor market condi tions and returning inflation to percent on a sustained basis without resulting in conditions that would eventu ally require an abrupt policy tightening a number of participants indicated that the stronger outlook for eco nomic activity along with their increased confidence that inflation would return to percent over the medium term implied that the appropriate path for the federal funds rate over the next few years would likely be slightly steeper than they had previously expected participants agreed that the longerrun normal federal funds rate was likely lower than in the past in part because of secular forces that had put downward pressure on real interest rates several participants expressed the judgment that it would likely become appropriate at some point for the committee to set the federal funds rate above its longer run normal value for a time some participants sug gested that at some point it might become necessary to revise statement language to acknowledge that in pur suit of the committees statutory mandate and con sistent with the median of participants policy rate pro jections in the sep monetary policy eventually would likely gradually move from an accommodative stance to being a neutral or restraining factor for economic activ ity however participants expressed a range of views on the amount of policy tightening that would likely be re quired over the medium term to achieve the commit tees goals participants agreed that the actual path of the federal funds rate would depend on the economic outlook as informed by incoming data committee policy action in their discussion of monetary policy for the period ahead members judged that information received since the committee met in january indicated that the labor market had continued to strengthen and that economic activity had been rising at a moderate rate job gains had been strong in recent months and the unemployment rate had stayed low recent data suggested that growth rates of household spending and business fixed invest ment had moderated from their strong fourthquarter readings on a month basis both overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy had continued to run below percent marketbased measures of inflation compensation had increased in re cent months but remained low surveybased measures of longerterm inflation expectations were little changed on balance all members viewed the recent data and other develop ments bearing on real economic activity as suggesting that the outlook for the economy beyond the current quarter had strengthened in recent months in addition notwithstanding increased market volatility over the in termeeting period financial conditions had stayed ac commodative and developments since the january meeting had indicated that fiscal policy was likely to pro vide greater impetus to the economy over the next few years than members had previously thought conse quently members expected that with further gradual ad justments in the stance of monetary policy economic ac tivity would expand at a moderate pace in the medium term and labor market conditions would remain strong members generally continued to judge the risks to the economic outlook as remaining roughly balanced most members noted that recent readings on inflation along with the strengthening of the economic outlook page federal open market committee provided support for the view that inflation on a month basis would likely move up in coming months and stabilize around the committees percent objective over the medium term members agreed to continue to monitor inflation developments closely after assessing current conditions and the outlook for economic activity the labor market and inflation mem bers voted to raise the target range for the federal funds rate to to percent they indicated that the stance of monetary policy remained accommodative thereby supporting strong labor market conditions and a sus tained return to percent inflation members agreed that the timing and size of future ad justments to the target range for the federal funds rate would depend on their assessments of realized and ex pected economic conditions relative to the committees objectives of maximum employment and percent in flation they reiterated that this assessment would take into account a wide range of information including measures of labor market conditions indicators of infla tion pressures and inflation expectations and readings on financial and international developments members also agreed that they would carefully monitor actual and expected developments in inflation in relation to the committees symmetric inflation goal members ex pected that economic conditions would evolve in a man ner that would warrant further gradual increases in the federal funds rate they judged that raising the target range gradually would balance the risks to the outlook for inflation and unemployment and was most likely to support continued economic expansion members agreed that the strengthening in the economic outlook in recent months increased the likelihood that a gradual upward trajectory of the federal funds rate would be ap propriate members continued to anticipate that the fed eral funds rate would likely remain for some time below levels that were expected to prevail in the longer run nonetheless they again stated that the actual path for the federal funds rate would depend on the economic outlook as informed by incoming data at the conclusion of the discussion the committee voted to authorize and direct the federal reserve bank of new york until it was instructed otherwise to execute transactions in the soma in accordance with the following domestic policy directive to be released at pm effective march the federal open market committee directs the desk to under take open market operations as necessary to maintain the federal funds rate in a target range of to percent including overnight re verse repurchase operations and reverse repur chase operations with maturities of more than one day when necessary to accommodate week end holiday or similar trading conventions at an offering rate of percent in amounts lim ited only by the value of treasury securities held outright in the system open market account that are available for such operations and by a percounterparty limit of billion per day the committee directs the desk to continue rolling over at auction the amount of principal payments from the federal reserves holdings of treasury securities maturing during march that exceeds billion and to continue rein vesting in agency mortgagebacked securities the amount of principal payments from the federal reserves holdings of agency debt and agency mortgagebacked securities received during march that exceeds billion effective in april the committee directs the desk to roll over at auction the amount of principal pay ments from the federal reserves holdings of treasury securities maturing during each calen dar month that exceeds billion and to rein vest in agency mortgagebacked securities the amount of principal payments from the federal reserves holdings of agency

directs the desk to engage in dollar roll and coupon swap transactions as necessary to facilitate settlement of the federal reserves agency mortgagebacked securities transactions the vote also encompassed approval of the statement below to be released at pm information received since the federal open market committee met in january indicates that the labor market has continued to strengthen and that economic activity has been rising at a moderate rate job gains have been strong in recent months and the unemployment rate has stayed low recent data suggest that growth rates of household

remain strong inflation on a month basis is ex pected to move up in coming months and to stabilize around the committees percent ob jective over the medium term nearterm risks to the economic outlook appear roughly bal anced but the committee is monitoring infla tion developments closely in view of realized and expected labor market conditions and inflation the committee de cided to raise the

likely to foster out comes for economic activity and inflation that best sat isfy his or her individual interpretation of the statutory mandate to promote maximum employment and price stability all participants who submitted longerrun projections expected that real gdp in would expand at a pace exceeding their individual estimates of the longerrun growth rate of real gdp participants generally saw real gdp growth moderating somewhat in each of the fol lowing two years with almost all participants who sub mitted longerrun projections anticipating that real gdp growth in would be at or within a few tenths of a percentage point of their longerrun estimates all par ticipants who submitted longerrun projections expected that throughout the projection period the unemploy ment rate would run below their estimates of its longer run level all participants projected that inflation as measured by the fourquarter percentage change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures pce would rise to or toward the committees per cent objective this year and would be at or a little above that objective by compared with the summary of economic projections sep from december a sub stantial majority of participants marked up their projec tions for real gdp growth and lowered their projections for the unemployment rate participants indicated that these revisions reflected a number of factors such as three members of the board of governors were in office at the time of the march meeting one member fewer than in december changes in fiscal policy a stronger outlook for economic growth abroad or recent strong job gains for inflation a majority of participants made slight upward revisions to their projections these revisions were attributed to re cent price data and the effects of a stronger economic outlook than in the december sep table and fig ure provide summary statistics for the projections as shown in figure participants generally continued to expect that the evolution of the economy relative to their objectives of maximum employment and percent in flation would likely warrant further gradual increases in the federal funds rate although the median of

majority of partici pants revised up their federal funds rate projections for and the median of participants projections for the longerrun level of the federal funds rate was slightly higher relative to the december sep nearly all participants who submitted longerrun projections ex pected that evolving economic conditions would make it appropriate for the federal funds rate to move above their

economic activity the median of participants projections for the growth rate of real gdp conditional on their individual assess ments of appropriate monetary policy was percent for this year and

would likely be appropriate for the federal funds rate to rise above their individual longerrun estimates at some point over the forecast pe riod in discussing their projections many participants con tinued to express the view that the appropriate trajectory of the federal funds rate over the next few years would likely involve gradual increases this view was predi cated on several factors including a judgment that a gradual path likely would appropriately balance the risks associated with among other considerations the possi bility that inflation pressures and financial imbalances could build if economic activity were to run well above its longrun sustainable level and the possibility that the forces depressing inflation could prove to be more per sistent than currently anticipated another factor men tioned was the view that the neutral real interest rate was historically low and would likely move up only slowly as always the appropriate path of the federal funds

in discussing the uncertainty and risks surrounding their projections most participants noted that the magnitude and timing of the economic effects of recent changes in fiscal policy were uncertain or that fiscal policy develop ments posed upside risks to real economic activity most participants also cited trade policy as a source of either uncertainty or downside risk a few participants noted that a prolonged period of tight labor markets posed risks of higher inflation could fuel financial imbalances and might contribute to heightened recession risks participants assessments of the appropriate

projected values are based on either the midpoint of the target range or the target level the condence interval around the median projected values is based on root mean squared errors of various private and government forecasts made over the previous years the condence interval is not strictly consistent with the projections for the federal funds rate primarily because these projections are not forecasts of the likeliest outcomes for the federal funds rate but rather projections of participants individual assessments of appropriate monetary policy still historical forecast errors provide a broad sense of the uncertainty around the future path of the federal funds rate generated by the uncertainty about the macroeconomic variables as well as additional adjustments to monetary policy that may be appropriate to oset the eects of shocks to the economy the condence interval is assumed to be symmetric except when it is truncated at zerothe bottom of the lowest target range for the federal funds rate that has been adopted in the past by the committee this truncation would not be intended to indicate the likelihood of the use of negative interest rates to provide additional monetary policy accommodation if doing so was judged appropriate in such situations the committee could also employ other tools including forward guidance and largescale asset purchases to provide

if the condence interval has been truncated at zero page federal open market committee forecast uncertainty the economic projections provided by the members of the board of governors and the presidents of the federal reserve banks inform discussions of monetary policy among policymakers and can aid public understanding of the basis for policy actions considerable uncertainty attends these projections however the economic and statistical models and relationships used to help produce economic forecasts are necessarily imperfect descriptions of the real world and the future path of the economy can be affected by myriad unforeseen developments and events thus in setting the stance of monetary policy participants consider not only what appears to be the most likely economic outcome as em bodied in their projections but also the range of alternative possibilities the likelihood of their occurring and the poten tial costs to the economy should they occur table summarizes the average historical accuracy of a range of forecasts including those reported in past monetary policy reports and those prepared by the federal reserve boards staff in advance of meetings of the federal open market committee fomc the projection error ranges shown in the table illustrate the considerable uncertainty as sociated with economic forecasts for example suppose a participant projects that real gross domestic product gdp and total consumer prices will rise steadily at annual rates of respectively percent and percent if the uncertainty at tending those projections is similar to that experienced in the past and the risks around the projections are broadly bal anced the numbers reported in table would imply a prob ability of about percent that actual gdp would expand within a range of to percent in the current year and to percent in the second and third years the corre sponding percent confidence intervals for overall infla tion would be to percent in the current year to percent in the second year and to percent in the third year figures a through c illustrate these confi dence bounds in fan charts that are symmetric and cen tered on the medians of fomc participants projections for gdp growth the unemployment rate and inflation how ever in some instances the risks around the projections may not be symmetric in particular the unemployment rate can not be negative furthermore the risks around a particular projection might be tilted to either the upside or the down side in which case the corresponding fan chart would be asymmetrically positioned around the median projection because current conditions may differ from those that prevailed on average over history participants provide judgments as to whether the uncertainty attached to their projections of each economic variable is greater than smaller than or broadly similar to typical levels of forecast uncer tainty seen in the past years as presented in table and reflected in the widths of the confidence intervals shown in the top panels of figures a through c participants cur rent assessments of the uncertainty surrounding their projec tions are summarized in the bottomleft panels of those fig ures participants also provide judgments as to whether the risks to their projections are weighted to the upside are weighted to the downside or are broadly balanced that is while the symmetric historical fan charts shown in the top panels of figures a through c imply that the risks to par ticipants projections are balanced participants may judge that there is a greater risk that a given variable will be above rather than below their projections these judgments are summa rized in the lowerright panels of figures a through c as with real activity and inflation the outlook for the future path of the federal funds rate is subject to considerable uncertainty this uncertainty arises primarily because each participants assessment of the appropriate stance of mone tary policy depends importantly on the evolution of real ac tivity and inflation over time if economic conditions evolve in an unexpected manner then assessments of the appropri ate setting of the federal funds rate would change from that point forward the final line in table shows the error ranges for forecasts of shortterm interest rates they suggest that the historical confidence intervals associated with projections of the federal funds rate are quite wide it should be noted however that these confidence intervals are not strictly con sistent with the projections for the federal funds rate as these projections are not forecasts of the most likely quarterly out comes but rather are projections of participants individual as sessments of appropriate monetary policy and are on an end ofyear basis however the forecast errors should provide a sense of the uncertainty around the future path of the federal funds rate generated by the uncertainty about the macroeco nomic variables as well as additional adjustments to monetary policy that would be appropriate to offset the effects of shocks to the economy if at some point in the future the confidence interval around the federal funds rate were to extend below zero it would be truncated at zero for purposes of the fan chart shown in figure zero is the bottom of the lowest target range for the federal funds rate that has been adopted by the committee in the past this approach to the construction of the federal funds rate fan chart would be merely a convention it would not have any implications for possible future policy decisions regarding the use of negative interest rates to pro vide additional monetary policy accommodation if doing so were appropriate in such situations the committee could also employ other tools including forward guidance and asset purchases to provide additional accommodation while figures a through c provide information on the uncertainty around the economic projections figure provides information on the range of views across fomc participants a comparison of figure with figures a through c shows that the dispersion of the projections across participants is much smaller than the average forecast

markets and open mar ket operations the manager of the system open market account soma provided a summary of domestic and global fi nancial developments over the intermeeting period broad measures of financial conditions had tightened somewhat in recent weeks with us equity prices lower the foreign exchange value of the dollar moderately higher and longerterm treasury yields up a little mar ket participants pointed to a range of factors contrib uting to the decline in stock prices including concerns about the outlook for trade policy both in the united attended through the discussion on financial stability issues states and abroad the potential for increased regulatory oversight of us technology companies and incoming data suggesting some moderation in global economic growth the rise in nominal us treasury yields was associated with an increase in inflation compensation that in turn seemed to reflect a firming in inflation data as well as a notable rise in crude oil prices judging from federal funds futures quotes the expected path of the federal funds rate changed relatively little over the inter meeting period while term libor london interbank offered rates had widened relative to comparable maturity ois overnight index swap rates in recent months the cost of dollar funding through the foreign exchange swap market had not risen to the same degree recent usage of standing us dollar liquidity swap lines had been low consistent with a view that the recent wid ening in liborois spreads did not reflect increased funding pressures or rising concerns about the condition of financial institutions the manager discussed the role of standing liquidity swap lines in supporting financial stability and recom mended that these swap lines be renewed at this meeting following the usual annual schedule the manager also discussed current projections for principal payments re ceived from mortgagebacked securities mbs held in the soma these projections suggested that under the committees plan for balance sheet normalization rein vestments of mbs principal would likely cease later this year although the timing is uncertain the deputy manager followed with a briefing focused on recent developments in the federal funds market noting that the effective federal funds rate had increased in re cent weeks and had moved toward the top of the target range for the federal funds rate in large part this devel opment seemed to reflect a firming in rates on repur chase agreements repos that in turn had resulted from an increase in treasury bill issuance and the associated higher demands for repo financing by dealers and others higher rates had reportedly made repos a more attrac tive alternative investment for major lenders in the fed eral funds market thus reducing the availability of fund ing in that market and putting some upward pressure on the federal funds rate while some of the recent pressure on the federal funds rate could be expected to fade over coming weeks as the market adjusts to higher levels of treasury bills the gradual normalization of the federal reserves balance sheet and the accompanying decline in page federal open market committee reserves was anticipated to continue putting some up ward pressure on the federal funds rate relative to the interest on excess reserves ioer rate the deputy manager then discussed the possibility of a small technical realignment of the ioer rate relative to the top of the target range for the federal funds rate since the target range was established in december the ioer rate has been set at the top of the target range to help keep the effective federal funds rate within the range lately the spread of the ioer rate over the effective federal funds rate had narrowed to only basis points a technical adjustment of the ioer rate to a level basis points below the top of the target range could keep the effective federal funds rate well within the target range this could be accomplished by imple menting a basis point increase in the ioer rate at a time when the committee raised the target range for the federal funds rate by basis points alternatively the ioer rate could be lowered basis points at a meeting in which the committee left the target range for the fed eral funds rate unchanged in their discussion of this issue participants generally agreed that it could become appropriate to make a small technical adjustment in the federal reserves approach to implementing monetary policy by setting the ioer rate modestly below the top of the target range for the federal funds rate such an adjustment would be con sistent with the committees statement in the policy normalization principles and plans that it would be pre pared to adjust the details of the approach to policy im plementation during the period of normalization in light of economic and financial developments many partici pants judged that it would be useful to make such a tech nical adjustment sooner rather than later participants generally agreed that it would be desirable to make that adjustment at a time when the fomc decided to in crease the target range for the federal funds rate that timing would simplify fomc communications and em phasize that the ioer rate is a helpful tool for imple menting the fomcs policy decisions but does not in itself convey the stance of policy while additional tech nical adjustments in the ioer rate could become nec essary over time these were not expected to be frequent a number of participants also suggested that before too long the committee might want to further discuss how it can implement monetary policy most effectively and efficiently when the quantity of reserve balances reaches a level appreciably below that seen in recent years the committee voted unanimously to renew the recip rocal currency arrangements with the bank of canada and the bank of mexico these arrangements are associ ated with the federal reserves participation in the north american framework agreement of in ad dition the committee voted unanimously to renew the dollar and foreign currency liquidity swap arrangements with the bank of canada the bank of england the bank of japan the european central bank and the swiss na tional bank the votes to renew the federal reserves participation in these standing arrangements are taken annually at the april or may fomc meeting by unanimous vote the committee ratified the open market desks domestic transactions over the intermeet ing period there were no intervention operations in foreign currencies for the systems account during the intermeeting period staff review of the economic situation the information reviewed for the may meeting in dicated that labor market conditions continued to

consumption ex penditures pce was percent in march survey based measures of longerrun inflation expectations were on balance little changed total nonfarm payroll employment rose less in march than in the previous two months but the increase for the first quarter as a whole was solid the labor force participation rate edged down in march but moved up a little on net in the first quarter the national unemploy ment rate remained at percent for a sixth consecutive month similarly the unemployment rates for african americans asians and hispanics were roughly flat on balance in recent months the share of workers em ployed part time for economic reasons was little changed at a rate close to that prevailing before the previous re cession the rate of privatesector job openings stayed at an elevated level in february the rate of quits re mained high and initial claims for unemployment insur ance benefits continued to be low through midapril recent readings showed that increases in labor compen sation stepped up modestly over the past year the em ployment cost index for private workers rose percent over the months ending in march and average hourly earnings for all employees increased percent over that period both increases were larger than those re ported for the months ending in march total industrial production increased in march and rose at a solid pace for the first quarter as a whole with gains minutes of the meeting of may page in the output of manufacturers mines and utilities au tomakers schedules suggested that assemblies of light motor vehicles would edge down in the second quarter from the average pace in the first quarter but broader indicators of manufacturing production such as the new orders indexes from national and regional manufactur ing surveys continued to point to further gains in factory output in the near term consumer expenditures rose at a modest pace in the first quarter following a strong gain in the preceding quarter monthly data pointed to some improvement toward the end of the quarter as real pce moved up in march after declining in january and february however the recent movements might have partly reflected the effects of a delay in many federal tax refunds which could have shifted some consumer spending from february to march light motor vehicle sales stepped down in the first quarter after a strong fourthquarter pace that was partly boosted by replacement sales following the fall hurricanes sales declined in april but indicators of ve hicle demand remained upbeat more broadly key fac tors that influence consumer spendingincluding gains in employment and real disposable personal income along with households elevated net worthshould con tinue to support solid real pce growth in the near term in addition the lower tax withholding resulting from the tax cuts enacted late last year was likely to provide some impetus to spending in coming months consumer sen timent as measured by the university of michigan sur veys of consumers remained elevated in april real residential investment was unchanged in the first quarter after a strong increase in the fourth quarter starts for new singlefamily homes decreased in march but the average pace in the first quarter was little changed from the fourth quarter in contrast starts of multifamily units moved up in march after contracting in february and they were higher in the first quarter than in the fourth sales of both new and existing homes increased in february and march real private expenditures for business equipment and in tellectual property increased at a moderate pace in the first quarter after rising briskly in the second half of last year nominal shipments of nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft edged down in march however forwardlooking indicators of business equipment spendingsuch as the backlog of unfilled capital goods orders along with upbeat readings on business senti ment from national and regional

at a slower rate in the first quarter than in the fourth quarter real federal purchases increased in the first quarter with gains in both defense and nondefense spending real purchases by state and local governments also moved higher state and local government payrolls were unchanged in the first quarter but nominal construction spending by these governments rose somewhat the nominal us international trade deficit widened in february as imports rose briskly outpacing the increase in exports preliminary data on trade in goods suggested that the trade deficit narrowed sharply in march

longerrun inflation expectationsincluding those from the michi gan survey the survey of professional forecasters and the desks survey of primary dealers and survey of market participantswere little changed on balance incoming data suggested that foreign economic activity continued to expand at a solid pace real gdp growth picked up in the first quarter in several emerging market economies emes including mexico china and some other parts of emerging asia however incoming data in a number of advanced foreign economies afes in particular real gdp in the united kingdom showed somewhat slower growth than market partici pants were expecting partly because of transitory factors such as severe weather overall inflation in most afes and emes continued to be subdued increasing in the afes in the first quarter on higher energy prices but page federal open market committee stepping down some in the emes partly reflecting lower food prices in some asian economies staff review of the

tight for subprime borrowers over the intermeeting period the staff provided its latest report on potential risks to financial stability the report again characterized the fi nancial vulnerabilities of the us financial system as moderate on balance this overall assessment incorpo rated the staffs judgment that vulnerabilities associated with asset valuation pressures while having come down a little in recent months nonetheless continued to be el evated the staff judged vulnerabilities from financial sector leverage and maturity and liquidity transformation to be low vulnerabilities from household leverage as be ing in the lowtomoderate range and vulnerabilities from leverage in the nonfinancial business sector as ele vated the staff also characterized overall vulnerabilities to foreign financial stability as moderate while highlight ing specific issues in some foreign economies includ ingdepending on the countryelevated asset valua tion pressures high private or sovereign debt burdens and political uncertainties staff economic outlook the staff projection for us economic activity prepared for the may fomc meeting continued to suggest that the economy was expanding at an abovetrend pace real gdp growth which slowed in the first quarter was expected to pick up in the second quarter and to outpace potential output growth through the unemploy ment rate was projected to decline further over the next few years and to continue to run below the staffs esti mate of its longerrun natural rate over this period rel ative to the forecast prepared for the march meeting the projection for real gdp growth in was revised down a little primarily in response to incoming con sumer spending data that were somewhat softer than the staff had expected beyond the projection for gdp growth was essentially unrevised with real gdp rising a little less on balance over the forecast period the projected decline in the unemployment rate over the next few years was also a touch smaller than in the pre vious forecast the nearterm projection for consumer price inflation was revised up slightly in response to incoming data on prices beyond the near term the forecast for inflation was a bit lower than in the previous projection reflecting the slightly higher unemployment rate in the new fore cast the rates of both total and core pce price infla tion were projected to be faster in than in the staff projected that total pce inflation would be near the committees percent objective over the next several years total pce inflation was expected to run slightly below core inflation in and because of a projected decline in energy prices the staff viewed the uncertainty around its projections for real gdp growth the unemployment rate and infla tion as similar to the average of the past years the staff saw the risks to the forecasts for real gdp growth and the unemployment rate as balanced on the upside recent fiscal policy changes could lead to a greater ex pansion in economic activity over the next few years than the staff projected on the downside those fiscal policy changes could yield less impetus to the economy page federal open market committee than the staff expected if the economy was already op erating above its potential level and resource utilization continued to tighten as the staff projected risks to the inflation projection also were seen as balanced an up side risk was that inflation could increase more than ex pected in an economy that was projected to move fur ther above its potential downside risks included the possibilities that longerterm inflation expectations may be lower than was assumed or that the run of low core inflation readings last year could prove to be more per sistent than the staff expected participants views on current conditions and the economic outlook in their discussion of the economic situation and the outlook meeting participants agreed that information received since the fomc met in march indicated that the labor market had continued to strengthen and that economic activity had been rising at a moderate rate job gains had been strong on average in recent months and the unemployment rate had stayed low recent data sug gested that growth of household spending had moder ated from its strong fourthquarter pace while business fixed investment had continued to grow strongly on a month basis both overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy had moved close to percent marketbased measures of inflation compen sation remained low surveybased measures of longer term inflation expectations were little changed on bal ance participants viewed recent readings on spending em ployment and inflation as suggesting little change on balance in their assessments of the economic outlook real gdp growth slowed somewhat less in the first quarter than anticipated at the time of the march meet ing and participants expected that the moderation in the growth of consumer spending early in the year would prove temporary they noted a number of economic fundamentals were currently supporting continued abovetrend economic growth these included a strong labor market federal tax and spending policies high lev els of household and business confidence favorable fi nancial conditions and strong economic growth abroad participants generally expected that further gradual in creases in the target range for the federal funds rate would be consistent with solid expansion of economic activity strong labor market conditions and inflation near the committees symmetric percent objective over the medium term participants generally viewed the risks to the economic outlook to be roughly balanced participants generally reported that their business con tacts were optimistic about the economic outlook however in a number of districts contacts expressed concern about the possible adverse effects of tariffs and trade restrictions including the potential for postponing or pulling back on capital spending labor markets were generally strong and contacts in a number of districts reported shortages of workers in specific industries or occupations in some cases labor shortages were con tributing to upward pressure on wages in many dis tricts business contacts experienced rising costs of nonlabor inputs particularly trucking rail and shipping rates and prices of steel aluminum lumber and petroleumbased commodities reports on the ability of firms to pass through higher costs to customers varied across districts activity in the energy sector remained strong and crude oil production was expected to con tinue to expand in response to rising global demand in contrast in agricultural areas low crop prices continued to weigh on farm income it was noted that the potential for higher chinese tariffs on key agricultural products could in the longer run hurt us competitiveness participants generally agreed that labor market condi tions strengthened further during the first quarter of the year nonfarm payroll employment posted strong gains averaging per month the unemployment rate was unchanged but at a level below most estimates of its longerrun normal rate both the overall labor force participation rate and the employmenttopopulation ra tio moved up the firstquarter data from the employ ment cost index indicated that the strength in the labor market was showing through to a gradual pickup in wage increases although the signal from other wage measures was less clear many participants commented that over all wage pressures were still moderate or were strong only in industries and occupations experiencing very tight labor supply several of them noted that recent wage developments provided little evidence of general overheating in the labor market with economic growth anticipated to remain above trend participants generally expected the unemployment rate to remain below or to decline further below their estimates of its longerrun normal rate several participants also saw scope for a strong labor market to continue to draw individuals into the workforce however a few others questioned whether tight labor markets would have a lasting positive effect on labor force participation the month changes in overall and core pce prices moved up in march to percent and percent re spectively most participants viewed the recent firming in inflation as providing some reassurance that inflation minutes of the meeting of may page was on a trajectory to achieve the committees symmet ric percent objective on a sustained basis in particular the recent readings appeared to support the view that the downside surprises last year were largely transitory some participants noted that inflation was likely to mod estly overshoot percent for a time however several participants suggested that the underlying trend in infla tion had changed little noting that some of the recent increase in inflation may have represented transitory price changes in some categories of health care and fi nancial services or that various measures of underlying inflation such as the month trimmed mean pce in flation rate from the federal reserve bank of dallas re mained relatively stable at levels below percent in dis cussing the outlook for inflation many participants em phasized that after an extended period of low inflation the committees longerrun policy objective was to re turn inflation to its symmetric percent goal on a sus tained basis many saw tight resource utilization the pickup in wage increases and nonlabor input costs and stable inflation expectations as supporting their projec tions that inflation would remain near percent over the medium term but a few cautioned that although marketbased measures of inflation compensation had moved up over recent months in their view these measures as well as some surveybased measures re mained at levels somewhat below those that would be consistent with an expectation of sustained percent in flation as measured by the pce price index participants commented on a number of risks and un certainties associated with their expectations for eco nomic activity the labor market and inflation over the medium term some participants saw a risk that as re source utilization continued to tighten supply con straints could develop that would intensify upward wage and price pressures or that financial imbalances could emerge which could eventually erode the sustainability of the economic expansion alternatively some partici pants thought that a strengthening labor market could bring a further increase in labor supply allowing the un employment rate to decline further with less upward pressure on wages and prices another area of uncer tainty was the outlook for fiscal and trade policies sev eral participants continued to note the challenge of as sessing the timing and magnitude of the effects of recent fiscal policy changes on household and business spend ing and on labor supply over the next several years in addition they saw the trajectory of fiscal policy thereaf ter as difficult to forecast with regard to trade policies a number of participants viewed the range of possible outcomes for economic activity and inflation to be par ticularly wide depending on what actions were taken by the united states and how us trading partners re sponded and some participants observed that while these policies were being debated and negotiations con tinued the uncertainty surrounding trade issues could damp business sentiment and spending in their discus sion of the outlook for inflation a few participants also noted the risk that if global oil prices remained high or moved higher us inflation would be boosted by the direct effects and passthrough of higher energy costs financial conditions tightened somewhat over the inter meeting period but remained accommodative overall the foreign exchange value of the dollar rose modestly but this move retraced only a bit of the depreciation of the dollar since its peak with their decline over the intermeeting period equity prices were about un changed on net since the beginning of the year but were still near their historical highs longerterm treasury yields rose but somewhat less than shorterterm yields and the yield curve flattened somewhat further in commenting on the staffs assessment of financial sta bility a couple of participants noted that after the bout of financial market volatility in early february the use of investment strategies predicated on a lowvolatility envi ronment may have become less prevalent and that some investors may have become more cautious however asset valuations across a range of markets and leverage in the nonfinancial corporate sector remained elevated relative to historical norms leaving some borrowers vul nerable to unexpected negative shocks with regard to the ability of the financial system to absorb such shocks several participants commented that regulatory reforms since the crisis had contributed to appreciably stronger capital and liquidity positions in the financial sector in this context a few participants emphasized the need to build additional resilience in the financial sector at this point in the economic expansion in their consideration of monetary policy over the near term participants discussed the implications of recent economic and financial developments for the outlook for economic growth labor market conditions and in flation and in turn for the appropriate path of the fed eral funds rate all participants expressed the view that it would be appropriate for the committee to leave the target range for the federal funds rate unchanged at the may meeting participants concurred that information received during the intermeeting period had not materi ally altered their assessment of the outlook for the econ omy participants commented that abovetrend growth page federal open market committee in real gdp in recent quarters together with somewhat higher recent inflation readings had increased their con fidence that inflation on a month basis would con tinue to run near the committees longerrun percent symmetric objective that said it was noted that it was premature to conclude that inflation would remain at levels around percent especially after several years in which inflation had persistently run below the commit tees percent objective in light of subdued inflation over recent years a few participants observed that ad justments in the stance of policy should take account of the possibility that longerterm inflation expectations have drifted a bit below levels consistent with the com mittees percent inflation objective most participants judged that if incoming information broadly confirmed their current economic outlook it would likely soon be appropriate for the committee to take another step in removing policy accommodation overall participants agreed that the current stance of monetary policy re mained accommodative supporting strong labor market conditions and a return to percent inflation on a sus tained basis with regard to the mediumterm outlook for monetary policy all participants reaffirmed that adjustments to the path for the policy rate would depend on their assess ments of the evolution of the economic outlook and risks to the outlook relative to the committees statutory objectives participants generally agreed with the assess ment that continuing to raise the target range for the fed eral funds rate gradually would likely be appropriate if the economy evolves about as expected these partici pants commented that this gradual approach was most likely to be conducive to maintaining strong labor mar ket conditions and achieving the symmetric percent in flation objective on a sustained basis without resulting in conditions that would eventually require an abrupt pol icy tightening a few participants commented that re cent news on inflation against a background of contin ued prospects for a solid pace of economic growth sup ported the view that inflation on a month basis would likely move slightly above the committees percent ob jective for a time it was also noted that a temporary period of inflation modestly above percent would be consistent with the committees symmetric inflation ob jective and could be helpful in anchoring longerrun in flation expectations at a level consistent with that objec tive meeting participants also discussed the recent flatter profile of the term structure of interest rates partici pants pointed to a number of factors contributing to the flattening of the yield curve including the expected grad ual rise of the federal funds rate the downward pressure on term premiums from the federal reserves stilllarge balance sheet as well as asset purchase programs by other central banks and a reduction in investors esti mates of the longerrun neutral real interest rate a few participants noted that such factors could make the slope of the yield curve a less reliable signal of future economic activity however several participants thought that it would be important to continue to mon itor the slope of the yield curve emphasizing the histor ical regularity that an inverted yield curve has indicated an increased risk of recession participants commented on how the committees com munications in its postmeeting statement might need to be revised in coming meetings if the economy evolved broadly as expected a few participants noted that if in creases in the target range for the federal funds rate con tinued the federal funds rate could be at or above their estimates of its longerrun normal level before too long in addition a few observed that the neutral level of the federal funds rate might currently be lower than their es timates of its longerrun level in light of this some par ticipants noted it might soon be appropriate to revise the forwardguidance language in the statement indicating that the federal funds rate is likely to remain for some time below levels that are expected to prevail in the longer run or to modify the language stating that the stance of monetary policy remains accommodative participants expressed a range of views on the amount of further policy firming that would likely be required over the medium term to achieve the committees goals participants indicated that the committee in making policy decisions over the next few years should conduct policy with the aim of keeping inflation near its longer run symmetric objective while sustaining the economic expansion and a strong labor market participants agreed that the actual path of the federal funds rate would depend on the economic outlook as informed by incoming information committee policy action in their discussion of monetary policy for the period ahead members judged that information received since the committee met in march indicated that the labor market had continued to strengthen and that economic activity had been rising at a moderate rate job gains had been strong on average in recent months and the un employment rate had stayed low recent data suggested that growth of household spending had moderated from its strong fourthquarter pace while business fixed in vestment continued to grow strongly on a month minutes of the meeting of may page basis both overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy had moved close to percent in particular in march the month percent increase in pce prices was equal to the committees longerrun ob jective of percent while the measure excluding food and energy prices was only slightly below percent marketbased measures of inflation compensation re mained low and surveybased measures of longerterm inflation expectations were little changed on balance all members viewed the recent data as indicating that the outlook for the economy had changed little since the previous meeting in addition financial conditions al though somewhat tighter than at the time of the march fomc meeting had stayed accommodative overall while fiscal policy was likely to provide sizable impetus to the economy over the next few years consequently members expected that with further gradual adjust ments to the stance of monetary policy economic activ ity would expand at a moderate pace in the medium term and labor market conditions would remain strong members agreed that inflation on a month basis is expected to run near the committees symmetric per cent objective over the medium term members judged that the risks to the economic outlook appeared to be roughly balanced after assessing current conditions and the outlook for economic activity the labor market and inflation mem bers agreed to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at to percent they noted that the stance of monetary policy remained accommodative thereby supporting some further strengthening in labor market conditions and a sustained return to percent in flation members agreed that the timing and size of future ad justments to the target range for the federal funds rate would depend on their assessments of realized and ex pected economic conditions relative to the committees objectives of maximum employment and percent in flation they reiterated that this assessment would take into account a wide range of information including measures of labor market conditions indicators of infla tion pressures and inflation expectations and readings on financial and international developments members also agreed that they would carefully monitor actual and expected developments in inflation in relation to the committees symmetric inflation goal members ex pected that economic conditions would evolve in a man ner that would warrant further gradual increases in the federal funds rate members agreed that the federal funds rate was likely to remain for some time below levels that they expected to prevail in the longer run however they noted that the actual path of the federal funds rate would depend on the economic outlook as informed by incoming data at the conclusion of the discussion the committee voted to authorize and direct the federal reserve bank of new york until it was instructed otherwise to exe cute transactions in the soma in accordance with the following domestic policy directive to be released at pm effective may the federal open mar ket committee directs the desk to undertake open market operations as necessary to main tain the federal funds rate in a target range of to percent including overnight reverse repurchase operations and reverse repurchase operations with maturities of more than one day when necessary to accommodate

available for such operations and by a per counterparty limit of billion per day the committee directs the desk to continue rolling over at auction the amount of principal payments from the federal reserves holdings of treasury securities maturing during each cal endar month that exceeds billion and to re invest in agency mortgagebacked securities the amount of principal payments from the federal reserves holdings of agency debt and agency mortgagebacked securities received during each calendar month that exceeds billion small deviations from these amounts for oper ational reasons are

petroskynadeau senior research advisor federal reserve bank of san francisco developments in financial markets and open mar ket operations the manager of the system open market account soma provided a summary of developments in do mestic and global financial markets over the intermeet ing period developments in emerging market econo mies emes and in europe were the focus of consider able attention by financial market participants over re cent weeks investor perceptions of increased economic and political vulnerabilities in several emes led to a no table depreciation in eme currencies relative to the dol lar market participants reported that an unwinding of investor positions had been a factor amplifying these currency moves in europe concerns about the political situation in italy and its potential economic implications prompted a significant widening in risk spreads on ital ian sovereign securities the share prices of italian banks and other banks that could be exposed to italy declined sharply in domestic financial markets expec tations for the path of the federal funds rate were little changed over the intermeeting period the manager noted that the release of the minutes of the may fomc meeting and particularly the reference to a possible tech nical adjustment in the interest on excess reserves ioer rate relative to the top of the fomcs target range for the federal funds rate prompted a small reduc tion in federal funds futures rates the deputy manager followed with a discussion of money markets and open market operations rates on treasury repurchase agreements repo had remained el evated in recent weeks apparently responding in part to increased treasury issuance over recent months in light of the firmness in repo rates the volume of opera tions conducted through the federal reserves over night reverse repurchase agreement facility remained low elevated repo rates may also have contributed to some upward pressure on the effective federal funds rate in recent weeks as lenders in that market shifted some of their investments to earn higher rates available in repo markets the deputy manager also discussed the current outlook for reinvestment purchases of agency mortgage backed securities mbs based on current projections principal payments on the federal reserves holdings of agency mbs would likely be lower than the monthly cap on redemptions that will be in effect beginning in the fall of this year consistent with the june addendum to the policy normalization principles and plans rein vestment purchases of agency mbs then are projected page federal open market committee to fall to zero from that point onward however prin cipal payments on agency mbs are sensitive to changes in various factors particularly longterm interest rates as a result agency mbs principal payments could rise above the monthly redemption cap in some future sce narios and thus require mbs reinvestment purchases in light of this possibility the deputy manager described plans for the desk to conduct small value purchases of agency mbs on a regular basis in order to maintain op erational readiness by unanimous vote the committee ratified the open market desks domestic transactions over the intermeet ing period there were no intervention operations in for eign currencies for the systems account during the in termeeting period staff review of the economic situation the information reviewed for the june meeting indicated that labor market conditions continued to strengthen in recent months and that real gross domes tic product gdp appeared to be rising at a solid rate in the first half of the year consumer price inflation as measured by the month percentage change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures pce was percent in april surveybased measures of longerrun inflation expectations were little changed on balance total nonfarm payroll employment expanded at a strong pace on average in april and may the national unem ployment rate edged down in both months and was percent in may the unemployment rates for afri can americans asians and hispanics all declined on net from march to may the rate for african americans was the lowest on record but still noticeably above the rates for other groups the overall labor force partici pation rate edged down in april and may but was still at about the same level as a year earlier the share of work ers employed part time for economic reasons was little changed at a level close to that from just before the pre vious recession the rate of privatesector job openings rose in march and stayed at that elevated level in april the rate of quits edged up on net over those two months and initial claims for unemployment insurance benefits continued to be low through early june recent readings showed that increases in labor compensation stepped up over the past year compensation per hour in the nonfarm business sector increased percent over the four quarters ending in the first quarter of this year compared with percent over the same four quarters a year earlier and average hourly earnings for all employees increased percent over the months ending in may compared with percent over the same months a year earlier total industrial production increased at a solid pace in april but the available indicators for may particularly production worker hours in manufacturing indicated that output declined in that month automakers sched ules suggested that assemblies of light motor vehicles would increase in the coming months and broader indi cators of manufacturing production such as the new or ders indexes from national and regional manufacturing surveys continued to point to solid gains in factory out put in the near term consumer spending appeared to be increasing briskly in the second quarter after rising at only a modest pace in the first quarter real pce increased at a robust pace in april after a strong gain in march although light motor vehicle sales declined in may indicators of vehicle de mand generally remained upbeat more broadly recent readings on key factors that influence consumer spend ingincluding gains in employment real disposable personal income and households net worthcontin ued to be supportive of solid real pce growth in the near term in addition the lower tax withholding result ing from the tax cuts enacted late last year still appeared likely to provide some additional impetus to spending in coming months consumer sentiment as measured by the university of michigan surveys of consumers re mained elevated in may residential investment appeared to be declining further in the second quarter after decreasing in the first quarter starts for new singlefamily homes were unchanged in april from their firstquarter average but starts of mul tifamily units declined noticeably sales of both new and existing homes decreased in april real private expenditures for business equipment and in tellectual property appeared to be rising at a moderate pace in the second quarter after a somewhat faster in crease in the first quarter nominal shipments of non defense capital goods excluding aircraft rose in april and forwardlooking indicators of business equipment spendingsuch as the backlog of unfilled capital goods orders along with upbeat readings on business senti ment from national and regional

net from midapril through early june nominal federal government spending data for april and may pointed to an increase in real federal purchases in the second quarter real state and local government purchases also appeared to be moving up although nominal construction expenditures by these govern ments edged down in april their payrolls rose at a mod erate pace on net in april and may net exports

economic forecast prepared for the june fomc meeting the staff continued to project that the economy would expand at an abovetrend pace real gdp appeared to be rising at a much faster pace in the second quarter than in the first and it was forecast to increase at a solid rate in the second half of this year over the period output was projected to rise further above the staffs estimate of its potential and the unemployment rate was projected to decline further be low the staffs estimate of its longerrun natural rate relative to the forecast prepared for the may meeting the projection for real gdp growth beyond the first half of was revised down a little in response to a higher assumed path for the exchange value of the dollar in addition the staff continued to anticipate that supply constraints might restrain output growth somewhat with real gdp rising a little less on balance over the forecast period the projected decline in the unemploy ment rate over the next few years was a touch smaller than in the previous forecast the staff forecast for total pce price inflation from to was not revised materially total consumer price inflation over the first half of appeared to be a little lower than in the previous projection mainly be cause of slightly softer incoming data on nonmarket prices but the forecast for the second half of the year was a little higher reflecting an upward revision to pro jected consumer energy prices over the next couple of quarters the staff continued to project that total pce inflation would remain near the committees percent objective over the medium term and that core pce price inflation would run slightly higher than total inflation minutes of the meeting of june page over that period because of a projected decline in con sumer energy prices in and the staff viewed the uncertainty around its projections for real gdp growth the unemployment rate and infla tion as similar to the average of the past years the staff saw the risks to the forecasts for real gdp growth and the unemployment rate as balanced on the upside recent fiscal policy changes could lead to a greater ex pansion in economic activity over the next few years than the staff projected on the downside those fiscal policy changes could yield less impetus to the economy than the staff expected if for example the marginal pro pensities to consume for groups most affected by the tax cuts are lower than the staff had assumed risks to the inflation projection also were seen as balanced the up side risk that inflation could increase more than expected in an economy that was projected to move further above its potential was counterbalanced by the downside risk that longerterm inflation expectations may be lower than was assumed in the staff forecast participants views on current conditions and the economic outlook in conjunction with this fomc meeting members of the board of governors and federal reserve bank pres idents submitted their projections of the most likely out comes for real gdp growth the unemployment rate and inflation for each year from through and over the longer run based on their individual assess ments of the appropriate path for the federal funds rate the longerrun projections represented each partici pants assessment of the rate to which each variable would be expected to converge over time under appro priate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy these projections and policy assessments are described in the summary of economic projections which is an addendum to these minutes in their discussion of the economic situation and the outlook meeting participants agreed that information received since the fomc met in may indicated that the labor market had continued to strengthen and that eco nomic activity had been rising at a solid rate job gains had been strong on average in recent months and the unemployment rate had declined recent data suggested that growth of household spending had picked up while business fixed investment had continued to grow strongly on a month basis overall inflation and core inflation which excludes changes in food and energy prices had both moved close to percent indicators of longerterm inflation expectations were little changed on balance participants viewed recent readings on spending em ployment and inflation as suggesting little change on balance in their assessments of the economic outlook incoming data suggested that gdp growth strengthened in the second quarter of this year as growth of consumer spending picked up after slowing earlier in the year par ticipants noted a number of favorable economic factors that were supporting abovetrend gdp growth these included a strong labor market stimulative federal tax and spending policies accommodative financial condi tions and continued high levels of household and busi ness confidence they also generally expected that fur ther gradual increases in the target range for the federal funds rate would be consistent with sustained expansion of economic activity strong labor market conditions and inflation near the committees symmetric percent objective over the medium term participants generally viewed the risks to the economic outlook as roughly bal anced participants reported that business fixed investment had continued to expand at a strong pace in recent months supported in part by substantial investment growth in the energy sector higher oil prices were expected to continue to support investment in that sector and dis trict contacts in the industry were generally upbeat though supply constraints for labor and infrastructure were reportedly limiting expansion plans by contrast district reports regarding the construction sector were mixed although here too some contacts reported that supply constraints were acting as a drag on activity con ditions in both the manufacturing and service sectors in several districts were reportedly strong and were seen as contributing to solid investment gains however many district contacts expressed concern about the possible adverse effects of tariffs and other proposed trade re strictions both domestically and abroad on future in vestment activity contacts in some districts indicated that plans for capital spending had been scaled back or postponed as a result of uncertainty over trade policy contacts in the steel and aluminum industries expected higher prices as a result of the tariffs on these products but had not planned any new investments to increase ca pacity conditions in the agricultural sector reportedly improved somewhat but contacts were concerned about the effect of potentially higher tariffs on their exports participants agreed that labor market conditions strengthened further over the intermeeting period nonfarm payroll employment posted strong gains in re cent months averaging more than per month this year the unemployment rate fell to percent in page federal open market committee may below the estimate of each participant who submit ted a longerrun projection participants pointed to other indicators such as a very high rate of job openings and an elevated quits rate as additional signs that labor market conditions were strong with economic growth anticipated to remain above trend participants generally expected the unemployment rate to remain below or de cline further below their estimates of its longerrun nor mal rate several participants however suggested that there may be less tightness in the labor market than im plied by the unemployment rate alone because there was further scope for a strong labor market to continue to draw individuals into the workforce contacts in several districts reported difficulties finding qualified workers and in some cases firms were coping with labor shortages by increasing salaries and benefits in order to attract or retain workers other business contacts facing labor shortages were responding by in creasing training for lessqualified workers or by invest ing in automation on balance for the economy overall recent data on average hourly earnings indicated that wage increases remained moderate a number of partic ipants noted that with the unemployment rate expected to remain below estimates of its longerrun normal rate they anticipated wage inflation to pick up further participants noted that the month changes in both overall and core pce prices had recently moved close to percent the recent large increases in consumer en ergy prices had pushed up total pce price inflation rel ative to the core measure and this divergence was ex pected to continue in the near term resulting in a tem porary increase in overall inflation above the commit tees percent longerrun objective in general partici pants viewed recent price developments as consistent with their expectation that inflation was on a trajectory to achieve the committees symmetric percent objec tive on a sustained basis although a number of partici pants noted that it was premature to conclude that the committee had achieved that objective the generally favorable outlook for inflation was buttressed by reports from business contacts in several districts suggesting some firming of inflationary pressures for example many business contacts indicated that they were experi encing rising input costs and in some cases firms ap peared to be passing these cost increases through to con sumer prices although core inflation and the month trimmed mean pce inflation rate calculated by the fed eral reserve bank of dallas remained a little below percent many participants anticipated that high levels of resource utilization and stable inflation expectations would keep overall inflation near percent over the me dium term in light of inflation having run below the committees percent objective for the past several years a few participants cautioned that measures of longerrun inflation expectations derived from financial market data remained somewhat below levels consistent with the committees percent objective accordingly in their view investors appeared to judge the expected path of inflation as running a bit below percent over the medium run some participants raised the concern that a prolonged period in which the economy operated beyond potential could give rise to heightened inflation ary pressures or to financial imbalances that could lead eventually to a significant economic downturn participants commented on a number of risks and un certainties associated with their outlook for economic activity the labor market and inflation over the medium term most participants noted that uncertainty and risks associated with trade policy had intensified and were concerned that such uncertainty and risks eventually could have negative effects on business sentiment and investment spending participants generally continued to see recent fiscal policy changes as supportive of eco nomic growth over the next few years and a few indi cated that fiscal policy posed an upside risk a few par ticipants raised the concern that fiscal policy is not cur rently on a sustainable path many participants saw po tential downside risks to economic growth and inflation associated with political and economic developments in europe and some emes meeting participants also discussed the term structure of interest rates and what a flattening of the yield curve might signal about economic activity going forward participants pointed to a number of factors other than the gradual rise of the federal funds rate that could con tribute to a reduction in the spread between longterm and shortterm treasury yields including a reduction in investors estimates of the longerrun neutral real inter est rate lower longerterm inflation expectations or a lower level of term premiums in recent years relative to historical experience reflecting in part central bank as set purchases some participants noted that such factors might temper the reliability of the slope of the yield curve as an indicator of future economic activity how ever several others expressed doubt about whether such factors were distorting the information content of the yield curve a number of participants thought it would be important to continue to monitor the slope of the yield curve given the historical regularity that an in verted yield curve has indicated an increased risk of re cession in the united states participants also discussed minutes of the meeting of june page a staff presentation of an indicator of the likelihood of recession based on the spread between the current level of the federal funds rate and the expected federal funds rate several quarters ahead derived from futures market prices the staff noted that this measure may be less affected by many of the factors that have contributed to the flattening of the yield curve such as depressed term premiums at longer horizons several participants cau tioned that yield curve movements should be interpreted within the broader context of financial conditions and the outlook and would be only one among many con siderations in forming an assessment of appropriate pol icy in their consideration of monetary policy at this meeting participants generally agreed that the economic expan sion was progressing roughly as anticipated with real economic activity expanding at a solid rate labor market conditions continuing to strengthen and inflation near the committees objective based on their current as sessments almost all participants expressed the view that it would be appropriate for the committee to con tinue its gradual approach to policy firming by raising the target range for the federal funds rate basis points at this meeting these participants agreed that even after such an increase in the target range the stance of mon etary policy would remain accommodative supporting strong labor market conditions and a sustained return to percent inflation one participant remarked that with inflation having run consistently below percent in re cent years and marketbased measures of inflation com pensation still low postponing an increase in the target range for the federal funds rate would help push infla tion expectations up to levels consistent with the com mittees objective with regard to the mediumterm outlook for monetary policy participants generally judged that with the econ omy already very strong and inflation expected to run at percent on a sustained basis over the medium term it would likely be appropriate to continue gradually raising the target range for the federal funds rate to a setting that was at or somewhat above their estimates of its longer run level by or participants reaffirmed that adjustments to the path for the policy rate would depend on their assessments of the evolution of the economic outlook and risks to the outlook relative to the commit tees statutory objectives participants pointed to various reasons for raising short term interest rates gradually including the uncertainty surrounding the level of the federal funds rate in the longer run the lags with which changes in monetary pol icy affect the economy and the potential constraints on adjustments in the target range for the federal funds rate in response to adverse shocks when shortterm interest rates are low in addition a few participants saw survey or marketbased indicators as suggesting that inflation expectations were not yet firmly anchored at a level con sistent with the committees objective a few also noted that a temporary period of inflation modestly above percent could be helpful in anchoring longerrun infla tion expectations at a level consistent with the commit tees symmetric objective participants offered their views about how much addi tional policy firming would likely be required to sustain ably achieve the committees objectives of maximum employment and percent inflation many noted that if gradual increases in the target range for the federal funds rate continued the federal funds rate could be at or above their estimates of its neutral level sometime next year in that regard participants discussed how the committees communications might evolve over com ing meetings if the economy progressed about as antici pated in particular a number of them noted that it might soon be appropriate to modify the language in the postmeeting statement indicating that the stance of monetary policy remains accommodative participants supported a plan to implement a technical adjustment to the ioer rate that would place it at a level basis points below the top of the fomcs target range for the federal funds rate a few participants suggested that before too long the committee might want to fur ther discuss how it can implement monetary policy most effectively and efficiently when the quantity of reserve balances reaches a level appreciably below that seen re cently committee policy action in their discussion of monetary policy for the period ahead members judged that information received since the fomc met in may indicated that the labor market had continued to strengthen and that economic activity had been rising at a solid rate job gains had been strong on average in recent months and the unemployment rate had declined recent data suggested that growth of household spending had picked up while business fixed investment had continued to grow strongly on a month basis both overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy had moved close to percent indicators of longerterm inflation expecta tions were little changed on balance page federal open market committee members viewed the recent data as consistent with a strong economy that was evolving about as they had ex pected they judged that continuing along a path of gradual policy firming would balance the risk of moving too quickly which could leave inflation short of a sus tained return to the committees symmetric goal against the risk of moving too slowly which could lead to a buildup of inflation pressures or material financial im balances consequently members expected that further gradual increases in the target range for the federal funds rate would be consistent with sustained expansion of economic activity strong labor market conditions and inflation near the committees symmetric percent ob jective over the medium term members continued to judge that the risks to the economic outlook remained roughly balanced after assessing current conditions and the outlook for economic activity the labor market and inflation mem bers voted to raise the target range for the federal funds rate to to percent they indicated that the stance of monetary policy remained accommodative thereby supporting strong labor market conditions and a sus tained return to percent inflation members agreed that the timing and size of future ad justments to the target range for the federal funds rate would depend upon their assessment of realized and ex pected economic conditions relative to the committees maximum employment objective and symmetric per cent inflation objective they reiterated that this assess ment would take into account a wide range of infor mation including measures of labor market conditions indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expecta tions and readings on financial and international devel opments with regard to the postmeeting statement members fa vored the removal of the forwardguidance language stating that the federal funds rate is likely to remain for some time below levels that are expected to prevail in the longer run members noted that although this forwardguidance language had been useful for com municating the expected path of the federal funds rate during the early stages of policy normalization this lan guage was no longer appropriate in light of the strong state of the economy and the current expected path for policy moreover the removal of the forwardguidance language and other changes to the statement should streamline and facilitate the committees communica tions importantly the changes were a reflection of the progress toward achieving the committees statutory goals and did not reflect a shift in the approach to policy going forward at the conclusion of the discussion the committee voted to authorize and direct the federal reserve bank of new york until it was instructed otherwise to exe cute transactions in the soma in accordance with the following domestic policy directive to be released at pm effective june the federal open market committee directs the desk to under take open market operations as necessary to maintain the federal funds rate in a target range of to percent including

ing rate of percent in amounts limited only by the value of treasury securities held outright in the system open market account that are available for such operations and by a per counterparty limit of billion per day the committee directs the desk to continue rolling over at auction the amount of principal payments from the federal reserves holdings of treasury securities maturing during june that exceeds billion and to continue reinvesting in agency mortgagebacked securities the amount of principal payments from the federal reserves holdings of agency debt and agency mortgagebacked

who submitted longerrun projections expected that in real gdp would expand at a pace exceeding their individual estimates of the longerrun growth rate of real gdp participants generally saw real gdp growth moderating somewhat in each of the fol lowing two years but remaining above their estimates of the longerrun rate all participants who submitted longerrun projections expected that throughout

continued to expect that the evolution of the economy relative to their objectives of maximum employment and percent in flation would likely warrant further gradual increases in the federal funds rate

participants who submitted longer run projections expected that during part of the projec tion period evolving economic conditions would make it appropriate for the federal funds rate to move some

participants projections for the growth rate of real gdp conditional on their individual assess ments of appropriate monetary policy was percent for this year and percent for next year the median was

relative to the march sep in discussing their projections many participants con tinued to express the view that the appropriate trajectory of the federal funds rate over the next few years would likely involve gradual increases this view was predi cated on several factors including a judgment that a gradual path of policy firming likely would appropriately balance the risks associated with among other consider ations the possibilities that us fiscal policy could have larger or more persistent positive effects on real activity and that shifts in trade policy or developments abroad could

policy as posing downside risks to their growth forecasts and a few participants also pointed to political developments in europe or the global outlook more generally as down siderisk factors a few

are based on either the midpoint of the target range or the target level the condence interval around the median projected values is based on root mean squared errors of various private and government forecasts made over the previous years the condence interval is not strictly consistent with the projections for the federal funds rate primarily because these projections are not forecasts of the likeliest outcomes for the federal funds rate but rather projections of participants individual assessments of appropriate monetary policy still historical forecast errors provide a broad sense of the uncertainty around the future path of the federal funds rate generated by the uncertainty about the macroeconomic variables as well as additional adjustments to monetary policy that may be appropriate to oset the eects of shocks to the economy the condence interval is assumed to be symmetric except when it is truncated at zerothe bottom of the lowest target range for the federal funds rate that has been adopted in the past by the committee this truncation would not be intended to indicate the likelihood of the use of negative interest rates to provide additional monetary policy accommodation if doing so was judged appropriate in such situations the committee could also employ other tools including forward guidance and largescale asset purchases to provide additional accommodation because

truncated at zero summary of economic projections of the meeting of june page forecast uncertainty the economic projections provided by the members of the board of governors and the presidents of the federal reserve banks inform discussions of monetary policy among policymakers and can aid public understanding of the basis for policy actions considerable uncertainty attends these projections however the economic and statistical models and relationships used to help produce economic forecasts are necessarily imperfect descriptions of the real world and the future path of the economy can be affected by myriad unforeseen developments and events thus in setting the stance of monetary policy participants consider not only what appears to be the most likely economic outcome as em bodied in their projections but also the range of alternative possibilities the likelihood of their occurring and the poten tial costs to the economy should they occur table summarizes the average historical accuracy of a range of forecasts including those reported in past monetary policy reports and those prepared by the federal reserve boards staff in advance of meetings of the federal open market committee fomc the projection error ranges shown in the table illustrate the considerable uncertainty as sociated with economic forecasts for example suppose a participant projects that real gross domestic product gdp and total consumer prices will rise steadily at annual rates of respectively percent and percent if the uncertainty at tending those projections is similar to that experienced in the past and the risks around the projections are broadly bal anced the numbers reported in table would imply a prob ability of about percent that actual gdp would expand within a range of to percent in the current year to percent in the second year and to percent in the third year the corresponding percent confidence inter vals for overall inflation would be to percent in the current year and to percent in the second and third years figures a through c illustrate these confidence bounds in fan charts that are symmetric and centered on the medians of fomc participants projections for gdp growth the unemployment rate and inflation however in some instances the risks around the projections may not be symmetric in particular the unemployment rate cannot be negative furthermore the risks around a particular projec tion might be tilted to either the upside or the downside in which case the corresponding fan chart would be asymmet rically positioned around the median projection because current conditions may differ from those that prevailed on average over history participants provide judgments as to whether the uncertainty attached to their projections of each economic variable is greater than smaller than or broadly similar to typical levels of forecast uncer tainty seen in the past years as presented in table and reflected in the widths of the confidence intervals shown in the top panels of figures a through c participants cur rent assessments of the uncertainty surrounding their projec tions are summarized in the bottomleft panels of those fig ures participants also provide judgments as to whether the risks to their projections are weighted to the upside are weighted to the downside or are broadly balanced that is while the symmetric historical fan charts shown in the top panels of figures a through c imply that the risks to par ticipants projections are balanced participants may judge that there is a greater risk that a given variable will be above rather than below their projections these judgments are summa rized in the lowerright panels of figures a through c as with real activity and inflation the outlook for the future path of the federal funds rate is subject to considerable uncertainty this uncertainty arises primarily because each participants assessment of the appropriate stance of mone tary policy depends importantly on the evolution of real ac tivity and inflation over time if economic conditions evolve in an unexpected manner then assessments of the appropri ate setting of the federal funds rate would change from that point forward the final line in table shows the error ranges for forecasts of shortterm interest rates they suggest that the historical confidence intervals associated with projections of the federal funds rate are quite wide it should be noted however that these confidence intervals are not strictly con sistent with the projections for the federal funds rate as these projections are not forecasts of the most likely quarterly out comes but rather are projections of participants individual as sessments of appropriate monetary policy and are on an end ofyear basis however the forecast errors should provide a sense of the uncertainty around the future path of the federal funds rate generated by the uncertainty about the macroeco nomic variables as well as additional adjustments to monetary policy that would be appropriate to offset the effects of shocks to the economy if at some point in the future the confidence interval around the federal funds rate were to extend below zero it would be truncated at zero for purposes of the fan chart shown in figure zero is the bottom of the lowest target range for the federal funds rate that has been adopted by the committee in the past this approach to the construction of the federal funds rate fan chart would be merely a convention it would not have any implications for possible future policy decisions regarding the use of negative interest rates to pro vide additional monetary policy accommodation if doing so were appropriate in such situations the committee could also employ other tools including forward guidance and asset purchases to provide additional accommodation while figures a through c provide information on the uncertainty around the economic projections figure provides information on the range of views across fomc participants a comparison of figure with figures a through c shows that the dispersion of the projections across participants is much smaller than the average forecast errors over the past years page federal open

attended tuesday session only attended through the discussion of monetary policy options at the effective lower bound a lee smith senior economist federal reserve bank of kansas city brent meyer policy advisor and economist federal reserve bank of atlanta cristina arellano monetary advisor federal reserve bank of minneapolis monetary policy options at the effective lower bound the staff provided a briefing that summarized its analy sis of the extent to which some of the committees mon etary policy tools could provide adequate policy accom modation if in future economic downturns the policy rate were again to become constrained by the effective lower bound elb the staff examined simulations from the staffs frbus model and various other eco nomic models to assess the likelihood of the policy rate returning to the elb and to evaluate how much addi tional policy accommodation could be delivered by the current toolkit this toolkit included thresholdbased forwardguidance policies in which the committee communicates that the federal funds rate will remain at the elb until either inflation or the unemployment rate reaches a certain threshold and balance sheet policies involving increases in the size or duration of the federal reserves asset holdings the staffs analysis indicated that under various policy rules including those prescribing aggressive reductions in the federal funds rate in response to adverse economic shocks there was a meaningful risk that the elb could bind sometime during the next decade that analysis also implied that thresholdbased forward guidance and balance sheet actions could provide additional accom modation that could help support economic activity and mitigate disinflationary pressures in these episodes in the model simulations because of unanticipated shocks and lags in the transmission of the effects of monetary policy actions on economic activity and inflation the ef fectiveness of monetary policy in general including for wardguidance and balance sheet policies was limited in mitigating the initial downturn in the economy the staff noted that there was considerable uncertainty sur rounding the estimated effects of those policies on the economy in addition estimates of how frequently the in the analysis the staff assumed that the elb was basis points equal to the midpoint of the target range for the federal funds rate from december to december page federal open market committee elb could bind in the future differed across the models that the staff examined in the discussion that followed the staffs briefing par ticipants generally agreed that their current toolkit could provide significant accommodation but expressed con cern about the potential limits on policy effectiveness stemming from the elb they viewed it as a matter of prudent planning to evaluate potential policy options in advance of such elb events many participants com mented on the monetary policy implications of the ap parent secular decline in neutral real interest rates that decline was viewed as likely driven by various factors including slower trend growth of the labor force and productivity as well as increased demand for safe assets in such circumstances those participants saw monetary policy as having less scope than in the past to reduce the federal funds rate in response to negative shocks ac cordingly in their view spells at the elb could become more frequent and protracted than in the past con sistent with the staffs analysis moreover the secular decline in interest rates was a global phenomenon and a couple of participants emphasized that this decline in creased the likelihood that the elb could bind simulta neously in a number of countries a few other partici pants raised the concern that frequent or extended elb episodes could result in expectations for inflation that were below the committees symmetric percent objec tive further limiting the scope for reductions in the fed eral funds rate to serve as a buffer for the economy and increasing the likelihood of elb episodes fiscal policy was viewed as a potentially important tool in addressing a future economic downturn in which monetary policy was constrained by the elb however countercyclical fiscal policy actions in the united states may be con strained by the high and rising level of federal govern ment debt a couple of participants saw macropruden tial and regulatory policies as tools that could be used to mitigate the risk of financial imbalances inducing an eco nomic downturn in which the elb constrained the fed eral funds rate participants generally agreed that both forward guidance and balance sheet actions would be effective tools to use if the federal funds rate were to become constrained by the elb in the addendum to the policy normaliza tion principles and plans statement issued in june the committee indicated that it would be prepared to use its full range of tools including altering the size and composition of its balance sheet if future economic conditions were to warrant a more accommodative monetary policy than can be achieved solely by reducing the federal funds rate however participants acknowl edged that there may be limits to the effectiveness of these tools in addressing an elb episode they also em phasized that there was considerable uncertainty about the economic effects of these tools consistent with that view a few participants noted that economic researchers had not yet reached a consensus about the effectiveness of unconventional policies a number of participants indicated that there might be significant costs associated with the use of unconventional policies and that these costs might limit in particular the extent to which the committee should engage in largescale asset purchases participants discussed the prominent role that previous communications about forward guidance and balance sheet actions in conjunction with those policy measures had in shaping public expectations about the potential future use of these tools and in determining their effec tiveness in general advance communications about these policies were seen as important in reinforcing pub lic understanding of the committees commitment to achieving its dualmandate objectives however several participants cautioned against being too specific about how the committee would deploy such tools in partic ular it was difficult to anticipate the forces that might push the economy into a recession and thus preserving some flexibility in responding to an economic downturn could be appropriate moreover although making mul tiyear commitments regarding asset purchases or the fu ture path of the federal funds rate could enhance the ef fectiveness of these policies such commitments could unduly constrain the choices of the committee in the future while the committees current toolkit was judged to be effective participants agreed as a matter of prudent planning to discuss their policy options further and to broaden the discussion to include the evaluation of po tential alternative policy strategies for addressing the elb building on their discussions at previous meet ings participants suggested that a number of possible al ternatives might be worth consideration and agreed to return to this topic at future meetings several partici pants indicated that it would be desirable to hold peri odic and systematic reviews in which the committee as sessed the strengths and weaknesses of its current mon etary policy framework developments in financial markets and open mar ket operations the manager of the system open market account soma provided a summary of developments in do minutes of the meeting of july august page mestic and global financial markets over the intermeet ing period asset prices were influenced by a number of factors including reports concerning trade tensions among the united states and its major trading partners foreign monetary policy developments and data point ing to strong growth momentum in the united states escalating trade tensions between china and the united states prompted notable market moves particularly in foreign exchange markets news on an agreement be tween the united states and the european union to con tinue talks to resolve their trade disputes provided some support for global equity prices the manager summa rized recent policy announcements by the european central bank ecb and the bank of japan boj european yields moved lower following a revi sion of the ecbs forward guidance at its june meeting concerning asset purchases and the path of shortterm rates the japanese yield curve steepened following re ports that the boj may facilitate an increase in longer term interest rates at its july meeting the boj an nounced a number of changes with respect to forward guidance on its policy outlook including its intention to keep interest rates low for an extended period mean while expectations concerning the path of monetary policy in the united states were little changed over the intermeeting period futures quotes indicated that mar ket participants placed high odds on a further quarter point firming in the federal funds rate at the september fomc meeting responses to the open market desks survey of primary dealers and survey of market partic ipants indicated that concerns about trade tensions had not affected the outlook for us monetary policy the deputy manager followed with a discussion of money markets and open market operations money market rates had moved up in line with the basis point increase in the interest on excess reserves ioer rate at the june meeting over the days following the june fomc meeting the effective federal funds rate effr moved up relative to the ioer rate reportedly reflect ing some special factors in the federal funds market in cluding increased demand for overnight funding by banks in connection with liquidity regulations and a pull back by federal home loan banks in their lending in the federal funds market these developments proved temporary and the effr subsequently returned to a level about basis points below the ioer rate the deputy manager also discussed the desks plans for smallvalue purchases of agency mortgagebacked secu rities mbs the staff projected that principal payments from the federal reserves holdings of agency mbs would fall below the fomcs monthly redemption cap beginning in october if principal payments followed this anticipated trajectory the desk planned to begin conducting monthly

and terms on ci loans in the second quarter most often citing increased competition from other lenders and increased ease of transacting in the secondary market as the reasons for doing so although some signs of deterioration emerged over the intermeeting period the credit quality of nonfi nancial corporations continued to be solid overall the ratio of aggregate debt to assets in this sector stayed near multidecade highs gross issuance of municipal bonds in june was robust continuing to increase from its slow start to the year page federal open market committee financing conditions for

conditions con tinued to ease but stayed tight overall growth in home purchase mortgages slowed a bit and refinancing activ ity continued to be muted over the past year with both developments partly reflecting the rise in mortgage rates earlier this year relative to the june fomc meeting interest rates on year conforming mortgages and yields on agency mbs were little changed financing conditions in consumer credit markets were little changed so far this year on balance and remained largely supportive of growth in household spending growth in consumer credit picked up in may from the more

sloos respondents reported easing standards on auto loans over the previous three months after several quarters in which banks had reported tight ening standards however a significant net fraction of banks reportedly continued to tighten standards for credit card accounts the staff provided its latest report on potential risks to financial stability the report again characterized the fi nancial vulnerabilities of the us financial system as moderate on balance this overall assessment incorpo rated the staffs judgment that vulnerabilities associated with asset valuation pressures continued to be elevated with no major asset class exhibiting valuations below their historical midpoints additionally the staff judged vulnerabilities from financialsector leverage and ma turity and liquidity transformation to be low vulnerabil ities from household leverage as being in the lowto moderate range and vulnerabilities from leverage in the nonfinancial business sector as elevated staff economic outlook in the us economic forecast prepared for this fomc meeting the staff continued to project that the economy would expand at an abovetrend pace real gdp was forecast to increase in the second half of this year at a pace that was just a little slower than in the first half of the year over the period output was projected to rise further above the staffs estimate of potential out put and the unemployment rate was projected to decline further below the staffs estimate of the longerrun nat ural rate however with labor market conditions already tight the staff continued to assume that the projected decline in the unemployment rate will be attenuated by a greaterthanusual cyclical improvement in the labor force participation rate relative to the forecast pre pared for the june meeting the projection for real gdp growth was revised up a little primarily in response to stronger incoming data on household spending in ad dition the staff continued to anticipate that supply con straints might restrain output growth somewhat in the medium term the unemployment rate was projected to be a little higher over the next few quarters than in the previous forecast but it was essentially unrevised there after the staff forecast for total pce price inflation in was revised down a little mainly because of a slower thanexpected increase in consumer energy prices in the second quarter and a downward revision to the forecast for energy price inflation in the second half of this year the staff continued to project that total pce inflation would remain near the committees percent objective over the medium term and that core pce price inflation would run slightly higher than total inflation over that period because of a projected decline in consumer en ergy prices in and the staff viewed the uncertainty around its projections for real gdp growth the unemployment rate and infla tion as similar to the average of the past years the staff saw the risks to the forecasts for real gdp growth and the unemployment rate as balanced on the upside household spending and business investment could ex pand faster over the next few years than the staff pro jected supported in part by the tax cuts enacted last year on the downside trade policies could move in a direc tion that would have significant negative effects on eco nomic growth another possibility was that recent fiscal minutes of the meeting of july august page policy actions could produce less of a boost to aggregate demand than assumed in the baseline projection as the current tightness of resource utilization may result in smaller multiplier effects than would be typical at other points in the business cycle risks to the inflation pro jection also were seen as balanced the upside risk that inflation could increase more than expected in an econ omy that was projected to move further above its poten tial was counterbalanced by the downside risk that longerterm inflation expectations may be lower than was assumed in the staff forecast participants views on current conditions and the economic outlook in their discussion of the economic situation and the outlook meeting participants agreed that information received since the fomc met in june indicated that the labor market had continued to strengthen and that eco nomic activity had been rising at a strong rate job gains had been strong on average in recent months and the unemployment rate had stayed low household spend ing and business fixed investment had grown strongly on a month basis both overall inflation and core in flation which excludes changes in food and energy prices had remained near percent indicators of longerterm inflation expectations were little changed on balance participants generally noted that economic growth in the second quarter had been strong incoming data indicated considerable momentum in spending by households and businesses several participants stressed the possibility that real gdp growth in the second quarter may have been boosted by transitory factors including an outsized increase in us exports for the second half of the year participants generally expected that gdp growth would likely slow from its secondquarter rate but would still exceed that of potential output participants noted a number of favorable economic factors that were sup porting abovetrend gdp growth these included a strong labor market stimulative federal tax and spending policies accommodative financial conditions and con tinued high levels of household and business confidence participants generally viewed the risks to the economic outlook as roughly balanced reports from business contacts confirmed a robust pace of expansion in several sectors of the economy includ ing energy manufacturing and services crude oil pro duction was reported as having grown rapidly in con trast to other sectors residential construction activity ap peared to have softened somewhat possibly reflecting declining home affordability higher mortgage rates scarcity of available lots in certain cities and delays in building approvals however a couple of participants reported vibrancy in industrial and multifamily construc tion activity business contacts in various sectors had cited labor shortages and other supply constraints as im pediments to production furthermore recent tariff in creases had put upward pressure on input prices busi ness contacts in a few districts reported that uncertainty regarding trade policy had led to some reductions or de lays in their investment spending nonetheless a num ber of participants indicated that most businesses con cerned about trade disputes had not yet cut back their capital expenditures or hiring but might do so if trade tensions were not resolved soon several participants observed that the agricultural sector had been adversely affected by significant declines in crop and livestock prices over the intermeeting period a couple of partic ipants noted that this development likely partly flowed from trade tensions participants agreed that labor market conditions had strengthened further over the intermeeting period pay rolls had grown strongly in june and labor market tight ness was reflected in recent readings on rates of private sector job openings and quits and on jobtojob switch ing by workers although the unemployment rate in creased slightly in june this increase was accompanied by an uptick in the labor force participation rate many participants commented on the fact that measures of aggregate nominal wage growth had so far picked up only modestly among the factors cited as containing the pickup in wage growth were low trend productivity growth lags in the response of nominal wage growth to resource pressures and improvements in the terms of employment that were not recorded in the wage data alternatively the recent pace of nominal wage growth might indicate continued slack in the labor market however some participants expected a pickup in aggre gate nominal wage growth to occur before long with a number of participants reporting that wage pressures in their districts were rising or that firms now exhibited greater willingness to grant wage increases participants noted that both overall inflation and infla tion for items other than food and energy remained near percent on a month basis a few participants ex pressed increased confidence that the recent return of inflation to near the committees longerterm percent objective would be sustained several participants com mented that increases in the prices of particular goods such as those induced by the tariff increases would likely page federal open market committee be one source of shortterm upward pressure on the in flation rate although offsetting influencesincluding the negative effects that trade developments were having on agricultural priceswere also noted reports from several districts suggested that firms had greater scope than in the recent past to raise prices in response to strong demand or increases in input costs including those associated with tariff increases and recent rises in fuel and freight expenses many participants anticipated that over the medium term high levels of resource utilization and stable inflation expectations would keep inflation near percent however some participants observed that inflation in recent years had shown only a weak connection to measures of resource pressures or indicated that they would like to see further evidence that measures of underlying inflation or readings on in flation expectations were on course to attain levels con sistent with sustained achievement of the committees symmetric percent inflation objective although a few participants observed that the trimmed mean measure of inflation calculated by the federal reserve bank of dal las was still below percent a couple noted forecasts that this measure would reach percent by the end of the year some participants raised the concern that a prolonged period in which the economy operated be yond potential could give rise to inflationary pressures or to financial imbalances that could eventually trigger an economic downturn participants commented on a number of risks and un certainties associated with their outlook for economic activity the labor market and inflation over the medium term they generally continued to see fiscal policy and the strengthening of the labor market as supportive of economic growth in the near term some noted larger or more persistent positive effects of these factors as an upside risk to the outlook a few participants indicated however that a fasterthanexpected fading of the fiscal impetus or a greaterthananticipated subsequent fiscal tightening constituted a downside risk in addition all participants pointed to ongoing trade disagreements and proposed trade measures as an important source of un certainty and risks participants observed that if a large scale and prolonged dispute over trade policies devel oped there would likely be adverse effects on business sentiment investment spending and employment moreover wideranging tariff increases would also re duce the purchasing power of us households further negative effects in such a scenario could include reduc tions in productivity and disruptions of supply chains other downside risks cited included the possibility of a significant weakening in the housing sector a sharp in crease in oil prices or a severe slowdown in emes participants remarked on the extent to which financial conditions remained supportive of economic expansion over the intermeeting period only a small change in overall financial conditions occurred with modest movements on net in equity prices and in the foreign exchange value of the dollar the yield curve had flat tened further over the intermeeting period participants who commented on financial stability noted that asset valuations remained elevated and corporate borrowing terms remained easy they also noted that regulatory changes introduced in the past decade had helped to reduce the susceptibility of the financial sector to runs and to strengthen the capital positions of banks and other financial institutions in discussing the capital positions of large banks a few participants emphasized that financial stability risks could be reduced if these in stitutions further boosted their capital cushions while their profits are strong and the economic outlook is fa vorable arguments for and against the activation of the countercyclical capital buffer as a means of further strengthening the capital positions of large banks were discussed in this context in their consideration of monetary policy participants discussed the implications of recent economic and finan cial developments for the economic outlook and the as sociated risks to that outlook participants remarked on recent abovetrend growth in real gdp and on indica tors of resource utilization some commented that con sumer spending had been quite strong in the second quarter confirming their impressions that the firstquar ter weakness had been temporary several participants also pointed to the continued strength in business fixed investment although the persistent weakness and the risk of a further slowdown in residential investment were also noted a few participants suggested there could still be some labor market slack citing recent increases in la bor force participation rates relative to prevailing demo graphically driven downward trends the participation rate of primeage men in particular was still below its previous business cycle peak other participants judged that labor market conditions were tight pointing to other data including job quits and openings rates and anecdotes from contacts participants generally characterized inflation as running close to the committees objective of percent and most of those who expressed a view indicated that recent readings on inflation had come in close to their expecta tions consistent with their sep submissions in june minutes of the meeting of july august page several participants remarked that inflation measured on a month basis was likely to move modestly above the committees objective for a time others pointed to some indicators suggesting that longterm inflation ex pectations could be below levels consistent with the committees percent inflation objective participants generally judged that the current stance of monetary policy remained accommodative supporting strong labor market conditions and inflation of around percent participants agreed that it would be appropri ate for the committee to leave the target range for the federal funds rate unchanged at this meeting with regard to the medium term various participants in dicated that information gathered since the committee met in june had not significantly altered their outlook for the us economy many participants suggested that if incoming data continued to support their current eco nomic outlook it would likely soon be appropriate to take another step in removing policy accommodation participants generally expected that further gradual in creases in the target range for the federal funds rate would be consistent with a sustained expansion of eco nomic activity strong labor market conditions and in flation near the committees symmetric percent objec tive over the medium term many participants reiterated that the actual path for the federal funds rate would ulti mately depend on the incoming data and on how those data affect the economic outlook participants discussed the economic forces and risks they saw as providing the rationale for gradual increases in the federal funds rate as well as scenarios that might cause them to depart from this expected path among other factors they pointed to uncertainty about the ap propriate level of the federal funds rate over the longer run and to constraints on the provision of monetary ac commodation during elb episodes as reasons for pro ceeding gradually in the removal of accommodation some participants noted that stronger underlying mo mentum in the economy was an upside risk most ex pressed the view that an escalation in international trade disputes was a potentially consequential downside risk for real activity some participants suggested that in the event of a major escalation in trade disputes the com plex nature of trade issues including the entire range of their effects on output and inflation presented a chal lenge in determining the appropriate monetary policy re sponse participants also discussed the possible implications of a flattening in the term structure of market interest rates several participants cited statistical evidence for the united states that inversions of the yield curve have of ten preceded recessions they suggested that policy makers should pay close attention to the slope of the yield curve in assessing the economic and policy outlook other participants emphasized that inferring economic causality from statistical correlations was not appropri ate a number of global factors were seen as contrib uting to downward pressure on term premiums includ ing central bank asset purchase programs and the strong worldwide demand for safe assets in such an environ ment an inversion of the yield curve might not have the significance that the historical record would suggest the signal to be taken from the yield curve needed to be con sidered in the context of other economic and financial indicators a couple of participants commented on issues related to the operating framework for the implementation of monetary policy including among other things the im plications of changes in financial market regulations for the demand for reserves and for the size and composi tion of the federal reserves balance sheet these par ticipants judged that it would be important for the com mittee to resume its discussion of operating frameworks before too long the chairman suggested that the com mittee would likely resume a discussion of operating frameworks in the fall many participants noted that it would likely be appropri ate in the nottoodistant future to revise the commit tees characterization of the stance of monetary policy in its postmeeting statement they agreed that the state ments language that the stance of monetary policy re mains accommodative would at some point fairly soon no longer be appropriate participants noted that the federal funds rate was moving closer to the range of estimates of its neutral level a number of participants emphasized the considerable uncertainty in estimates of the neutral rate of interest stemming from sources such as fiscal policy and largescale asset purchase programs against this background continuing to provide an ex plicit assessment of the federal funds rate relative to its neutral level could convey a false sense of precision committee policy action in their discussion of monetary policy for the period ahead members judged that information received since the fomc met in june indicated that the labor market had continued to strengthen and that economic activity had been rising at a strong rate job gains had been strong on average in recent months and the unemploy ment rate had stayed low household spending and business fixed investment had grown strongly on a page federal open market committee month basis both overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy

currency and equity markets over the period in addition con cerns about trade tensions between the united states and china were the focus of a great deal of attention among market participants such concerns led the shanghai composite index to drop as much as percent at one point over the intermeeting period before recov ering somewhat the renminbi however was relatively stable reportedly in part because investors believed that chinese authorities were prepared to take measures to counter significant renminbi depreciation regarding domestic financial markets the manager noted that us equity markets had posted strong gains spurred by optimism regarding the us economic out look and rising corporate earnings longerterm treas ury yields moved higher and marketbased measures of the expected path of the funds rate edged up according to the open market desks survey of primary dealers and survey of market participants a basis point in crease in the target range for the federal funds rate at the september meeting was widely expected moreover in vestors appeared to be placing high odds on a further quarterpoint policy firming at the december meeting in us money markets the spread between the three month london interbank offered rate and threemonth overnight index swap ois rates continued to narrow the widening in that spread earlier in the year appeared to reflect an especially rapid runup in treasury bill sup ply treasury bill supply remained elevated and report edly continued to contribute to upward pressure on overnight repurchase agreement repo rates the rela tively high level of repo rates was associated with con tinued very modest takeup in the federal reserves overnight reverse repurchase agreement on rrp op erations elevated repo rates may also have contributed to the relatively tight spread between the interest on ex cess reserves ioer rate and the effective federal funds rate that spread stood at basis points over much of the period and seemed likely to narrow to basis points in the near future as yet there were no signs that the upward pressure on the federal funds rate relative to the ioer rate was due to scarcity of aggregate reserves in the banking system the level of reserves in the banking system temporarily dipped sharply in midseptember in connection with a sizable inflow of tax receipts to the page federal open market committee treasurys account at the federal reserve however that reduction in reserves in the banking system did not seem to have any effect on the federal funds market or the effective federal funds rate in reviewing federal reserve operations the manager noted that market reaction to the ongoing reduction in the systems holdings of treasury and agency securities had been muted to date with the increase in the caps on redemptions to be implemented beginning in octo ber reinvestment of treasury securities would occur al most exclusively in the middle month of each quarter in connection with the treasurys midquarter refunding auctions under the baseline path for interest rates the federal reserves reinvestments of principal payments on agency mortgagebacked securities would likely fall to zero beginning in october however prepayments could rise somewhat above the redemption cap in some months in the future given the uncertainties surrounding prepayment projections by unanimous vote the committee ratified the desks domestic transactions over the intermeeting period there were no intervention operations in foreign curren cies for the systems account during the intermeeting pe riod staff review of the economic situation the information reviewed for the september meeting indicated that labor market conditions contin ued to strengthen in recent months and that real gross domestic product gdp appeared to be rising at a strong rate in the third quarter similar to its pace in the first half of the year the flooding and damage from hurricane florence which made landfall on septem ber seemed likely to have a modest transitory effect on national economic growth in the second half of the year consumer price inflation as measured by the month percentage change in the price index for per

nonfarm busi ness sector increased percent over the four quarters ending in the second quarter and average hourly earn ings for all employees rose percent over the months ending in august industrial production expanded at a solid pace in july and august automakers assembly schedules suggested that light motor vehicle production would be roughly flat in the fourth quarter although broader indicators of manufacturing production such as the new orders in dexes from national and regional manufacturing surveys pointed to further solid gains in factory output in the near term real pce appeared to be rising strongly in the third quarter retail sales increased somewhat in august and the data for july were revised up to show a sizable gain however the rate of light motor vehicle sales moved down in july and august from the robust pace in the second quarter the staffs preliminary assessment was that the consequences of hurricane florence would have a slight negative effect on aggregate real pce growth in the third quarter but that spending would bounce back in the fourth quarter more broadly recent readings on key factors that influence consumer spend ingincluding gains in

governments appeared to be roughly flat as state and local government payrolls decreased slightly in july and august while nominal construction spending by these governments rose modestly in july the nominal us international trade deficit widened in june and july with declining exports and rising imports the decline in exports largely reflected lower exports of capital goods while greater imports

increase in the second half of this year at a rate that was just a little slower than in the first half of the year the staffs preliminary assessment was that the effects of hurricane florence would lead to a slight reduction in real gdp growth in the third quarter and a small addition to growth in the fourth quarter as economic activity re turned to more normal levels and some disrupted activ ity was made up over the period output was projected to rise at a rate above or at the staffs estimate of potential growth and then slow to a pace below it in the unemployment rate was projected to decline further below the staffs estimate of its longerrun natu ral rate but to bottom out in and begin to edge up in relative to the forecast prepared for the previ ous meeting the projection for real gdp growth this year was revised up a little primarily in response to strongerthanexpected incoming data on household spending and business investment the projection for the medium term was not materially changed in part be cause the recently enacted tariffs on chinese goods and the retaliatory actions of china were judged to have only a small net effect on us real gdp growth over the next few years in addition the staff continued to anticipate that supply constraints might restrain output growth somewhat in the medium term the unemployment rate was projected to be a little lower over the medium term than in the previous forecast partly in response to the staffs assessment that the natural rate of unemployment was a bit lower than previously assumed with labor market conditions already tight the staff continued to minutes of the meeting of september page assume that projected employment gains would manifest in smallerthanusual downward pressure on the unem ployment rate and in largerthanusual upward pressure on the labor force participation rate the staff forecast for total pce price inflation in was revised up slightly mainly because of a fasterthan expected increase in consumer energy prices in the sec ond half the staff continued to project that total pce inflation would remain near the committees percent objective over the medium term and that core pce price inflation would run slightly higher than total inflation over that period because of a projected decline in con sumer energy prices in through the staff viewed the uncertainty around its projections for real gdp growth the unemployment rate and infla tion as similar to the average of the past years the staff also saw the risks to the forecasts for real gdp growth and the unemployment rate as balanced on the upside household spending and business investment could expand faster than the staff projected supported in part by the tax cuts enacted last year on the down side trade policies and foreign economic developments could move in directions that have significant negative effects on us economic growth risks to the inflation projection also were seen as balanced the upside risk that inflation could increase more than expected in an economy that was projected to move further above its potential was counterbalanced by the downside risk that longerterm inflation expectations may be lower than was assumed in the staff forecast participants views on current conditions and the economic outlook in conjunction with this fomc meeting members of the board of governors and federal reserve bank pres idents submitted their projections of the most likely out comes for real gdp growth the unemployment rate and inflation for each year from through and over the longer run based on their individual assess ments of the appropriate path for the federal funds rate the longerrun projections represented each partici pants assessment of the rate to which each variable would be expected to converge over time under appro priate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy these projections are described in the summary of economic projections sep which is an addendum to these minutes in their discussion of the economic situation and the outlook meeting participants agreed that information received since the fomc met in august indicated that the labor market continued to strengthen and that eco nomic activity rose at a strong rate job gains were strong on average in recent months and the unemploy ment rate stayed low recent data suggested that house hold spending and business fixed investment grew strongly on a month basis both overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy re mained near percent indicators of longerterm infla tion expectations were little changed on balance meeting participants noted that a number of communi ties suffered devastating losses associated with hurri cane florence despite the magnitude of the storm related destruction participants expected the imprint on the level of overall economic activity at the national level to be relatively modest consistent with the experience following several previous major storms based on recent readings on spending employment and inflation almost all participants saw little change in their assessment of the economic outlook although a few of them judged that recent data pointed to a pace of eco nomic activity that was stronger than they had expected earlier this year participants noted a number of favora ble economic factors that were supporting abovetrend gdp growth these included strong labor market condi tions stimulative federal tax and spending policies ac commodative financial conditions solid household bal ance sheets and continued high levels of household and business confidence a number of participants observed that the stimulative effects of the changes in fiscal policy would likely diminish over the next several years a cou ple of participants commented that recent strong growth in gdp may also be due in part to increases in the growth rate of the economys productive capacity in their discussion of the household sector participants generally characterized consumption growth as strong and they judged that robust increases in disposable in come high levels of consumer confidence and solid household balance sheets had contributed to the strength in spending several participants noted that the household saving rate had been revised up significantly in the most recent estimates published by the bureau of economic activity a few of those participants re marked that the upward revision in the saving rate could be viewed as evidence of the strength of the financial position of the household sector and could be a factor that would further support solid expansion of consump tion spending however a couple of participants noted that the higher saving rate may not be a precursor to higher future consumption growth for example the higher saving rate may indicate some greater caution on the part of consumers greater inequality of income and page federal open market committee wealthwhich would imply a lower aggregate propen sity to spendor changing consumer behavior in a low interest rate environment with regard to residential in vestment a few participants noted weak residential con struction activity at the national or district level which was attributed in part to higher interest rates or supply constraints participants noted that business fixed investment had grown strongly so far this year a few commented that recent changes in federal tax policy had likely bolstered investment spending contacts in most sectors re mained optimistic about their business prospects and surveys of manufacturing activity were broadly favora ble despite this optimism a number of contacts cited factors that were causing them to forego production or investment opportunities in some cases including labor shortages and uncertainty regarding trade policy in par ticular tariffs on aluminum and steel were cited as re ducing new investment in the energy sector contacts also suggested that firms were attempting to diversify the set of countries with which they tradeboth imports and exportsas a result of uncertainty over tariff policy contacts in the agricultural industry reported that tariffs imposed by china had resulted in lower crop prices fur ther depressing incomes in that sector although a new federal program was expected to offset some income losses in their discussion of labor markets participants gener ally agreed that conditions continued to strengthen contacts in many districts reported tight labor markets with difficulty finding qualified workers in some cases firms were coping with labor shortages by increasing sal aries benefits or workplace amenities in order to attract and retain workers other business contacts facing labor shortages were responding by increasing training for lessqualified workers for the economy overall partic ipants generally agreed that on balance recent data sug gested some acceleration in labor costs but that wage growth remained moderate by historical standards which was due in part to tepid productivity growth regarding inflation participants noted that on a month basis both overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy remained near per cent indicators of longerterm inflation expectations were little changed on balance in general participants viewed recent consumer price developments as con sistent with their expectation that inflation was on a tra jectory to achieve the committees symmetric percent objective on a sustained basis several participants com mented that inflation may modestly exceed percent for a period of time reports from business contacts and surveys in a number of districts also indicated some firming in inflationary pressures in particular some contacts indicated that input prices had been bolstered by strong demand or import tariffs moreover several participants reported that firms in their districts that were facing higher input prices because of tariffs per ceived that they had an increased ability to raise the prices of their products a couple of participants em phasized that because inflation had run below the com mittees percent objective for the past several years some measures of trend inflation or longerterm infla tion expectations were below levels consistent with the percent objective these participants judged that a modest increase in inflation expectations would be im portant for achieving the inflation objective on a sus tained basis in their discussion of developments in financial markets a number of participants noted that financial conditions remained accommodative the rise in interest rates and appreciation of the dollar over the intermeeting period had been offset by increases in equity prices and broader measures continued to point to accommodative financial conditions some participants commented about the continued growth in leveraged loans the loosening of terms and standards on these loans or the growth of this activity in the nonbank sector as reasons to remain mindful of vulnerabilities and possible risks to financial stability participants commented on a number of risks and un certainties associated with their outlook for economic activity the labor market and inflation over the medium term participants generally agreed that risks to the out look appeared roughly balanced some participants commented that trade policy developments remained a source of uncertainty for the outlook for domestic growth and inflation the divergence between domestic and foreign economic growth prospects and monetary policies was cited as presenting a downside risk because of the potential for further strengthening of the us dol lar some participants noted that financial stresses in a few emes could pose additional risks if they were to spread more broadly through the global economy and financial markets with regard to upside risks partici pants variously noted that high consumer confidence accommodative financial conditions or greaterthan expected effects of fiscal stimulus could lead to stronger thanexpected economic outcomes tightening re source utilization and an increasing ability of firms to raise output prices were cited as factors that could lead to higherthanexpected inflation while lowerthan expected growth a strengthening of the us dollar or minutes of the meeting of september page inflation expectations persistently running below per cent were mentioned as risks that could lead to lower inflation a few participants offered perspectives on the term structure of interest rates and what a potential inversion of the yield curve might signal about economic pro spects in light of the historical regularity that an inverted yield curve has often preceded the onset of recessions in the united states on the one hand an inverted yield curve could indicate an increased risk of recession on the other hand the low level of term premiums in recent yearsreflecting in part central bank asset purchases could temper the reliability of the slope of the yield curve as an indicator of future economic activity in addition the recent rise and possible further increases in longer term interest rates might diminish the likelihood that the yield curve would invert in the near term in their consideration of monetary policy at this meeting participants generally judged that the economy was evolving about as anticipated with real economic activ ity rising at a strong rate labor market conditions con tinuing to strengthen and inflation near the committees objective based on their current assessments all partic ipants expressed the view that it would be appropriate for the committee to continue its gradual approach to policy firming by raising the target range for the federal funds rate basis points at this meeting almost all considered that it was also appropriate to revise the committees postmeeting statement in order to remove the language stating that the stance of monetary policy remains accommodative participants discussed a number of reasons for removing the language at this time noting that the committee would not be signaling a change in the expected path for policy particularly as the target range for the federal funds rate announced af ter the committees meeting would still be below all of the estimates of its longerrun level submitted in the sep tember sep in addition waiting until the target range for the federal funds rate had been increased further to remove the characterization of the policy stance as ac commodative could convey a false sense of precision in light of the considerable uncertainty surrounding all es timates of the neutral federal funds rate with regard to the outlook for monetary policy beyond this meeting participants generally anticipated that fur ther gradual increases in the target range for the federal funds rate would most likely be consistent with a sus tained economic expansion strong labor market condi tions and inflation near percent over the medium term this gradual approach would balance the risk of tightening monetary policy too quickly which could lead to an abrupt slowing in the economy and inflation mov ing below the committees objective against the risk of moving too slowly which could engender inflation per sistently above the objective and possibly contribute to a buildup of financial imbalances participants offered their views about how much addi tional policy firming would likely be required for the committee to sustainably achieve its objectives of max imum employment and percent inflation a few par ticipants expected that policy would need to become modestly restrictive for a time and a number judged that it would be necessary to temporarily raise the federal funds rate above their assessments of its longerrun level in order to reduce the risk of a sustained overshooting of the committees percent inflation objective or the risk posed by significant financial imbalances a couple of participants indicated that they would not favor adopting a restrictive policy stance in the absence of clear signs of an overheating economy and rising infla tion participants reaffirmed that adjustments to the path for the policy rate would depend on their assessments of the evolution of the economic outlook and risks to the out look relative to the committees statutory objectives many of them noted that future adjustments to the tar get range for the federal funds rate will depend on the evaluation of incoming information and its implications for the economic outlook in this context estimates of the level of the neutral federal funds rate would be only one among many factors that the committee would con sider in making its policy decisions building on comments expressed at previous meetings a couple of participants indicated that it would be desir able to assess the committees strategic approach to the conduct of policy and to hold a periodic and systematic review of the strengths and weaknesses of the commit tees monetary policy framework committee policy action in their discussion of monetary policy for the period ahead members judged that information received since the committee met in august indicated that the labor market had continued to strengthen and that economic activity had been rising at a strong rate job gains had been strong on average in recent months and the un employment rate had stayed low household spending and business fixed investment had grown strongly on a month basis both overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy remained near per cent indicators of longerterm inflation expectations were little changed on balance page federal open market committee members viewed the recent data as consistent with an economy that was evolving about as they had expected consequently members expected that further gradual increases in the target range for the federal funds rate would be consistent with sustained expansion of eco nomic activity strong labor market conditions and in flation near the committees symmetric percent objec tive over the medium term members continued to judge that the risks to the economic outlook remained roughly balanced after assessing current conditions and the outlook for economic activity the labor market and inflation mem bers voted to raise the target range for the federal funds rate to to percent members agreed that the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate would depend on their assessment of realized and expected economic conditions relative to the committees maximumemployment objective and symmetric percent inflation objective they reiterated that this assessment would take into account a wide range of information including measures of labor mar ket conditions indicators of inflation pressures and in flation expectations and readings on financial and inter national developments with regard to the postmeeting statement members agreed to remove the sentence indicating that the stance of monetary policy remains accommodative members made various points regarding the removal of the sentence from the statement these points included that the characterization of the stance of policy as ac commodative had provided useful forward guidance in the early stages of the policy normalization process that this characterization was no longer providing meaning ful information in light of uncertainty surrounding the level of the neutral policy rate that it was appropriate to remove the characterization of the stance from the committees statement before the target range for the federal funds rate moved closer to the range of estimates of the neutral policy rate and that the committees ear lier communications had helped prepare the public for this change at the conclusion of the discussion the committee voted to authorize and direct the federal reserve bank of new york until it was instructed otherwise to exe cute transactions in the soma in accordance with the following domestic policy directive to be released at pm effective september the federal open market committee directs the desk to undertake open market operations as necessary to maintain the federal funds rate in a target range of to percent including overnight

directs the desk to engage in dollar roll and coupon swap transactions as necessary to facilitate settlement of the federal reserves agency mortgagebacked securities transactions the vote also encompassed approval of the statement below to be released at pm information received since the federal open market committee met in august indicates that the labor market has continued to strengthen

maximum employment and price stability all participants who submitted longerrun projections expected that in real gdp would expand at a pace exceeding their individual estimates of the longerrun growth rate of real gdp all participants anticipated that real gdp growth would moderate in the coming years and a majority of participants projected growth in to be below their estimates of the longerrun rate all participants who submitted longerrun projections expected that the unemployment rate would run below their estimates of its longerrun level throughout the projection period participants generally projected that inflation as measured by the fourquarter percentage change in the price index for personal consumption ex penditures pce would be at or near the committees percent objective at the end of and would con tinue at close to that rate through compared with the summary of economic projections sep from june a solid majority of participants marked up their

appropriately balance the risk of a buildup of inflationary pressures or other imbalances as sociated with high levels of resource utilization against the risk that factors such as diminishing fiscal

projected values is based on root mean squared errors of various private and government forecasts made over the previous years the condence interval is not strictly consistent with the projections for the federal funds rate primarily because these projections are not forecasts of the likeliest outcomes for the federal funds rate but rather projections of participants individual assessments of appropriate monetary policy still historical forecast errors provide a broad sense of the uncertainty around the future path of the federal funds rate generated by the uncertainty about the macroeconomic variables as well as additional adjustments to monetary policy that may be appropriate to oset the eects of shocks to the economy the condence interval is assumed to be symmetric except when it is truncated at zerothe bottom of the lowest target range for the federal funds rate that has been adopted in the past by the committee this truncation would not be intended to indicate the likelihood of the use of negative interest rates to provide additional monetary policy accommodation if doing so was judged appropriate in such situations the committee could also employ other tools

shaded area encompasses less than a percent condence interval if the condence interval has been truncated at zero summary of economic projections of the meeting of september page forecast uncertainty the economic projections provided by the members of the board of governors and the presidents of the federal reserve banks inform discussions of monetary policy among policymakers and can aid public understanding of the basis for policy actions considerable uncertainty attends these projections however the economic and statistical models and relationships used to help produce economic forecasts are necessarily imperfect descriptions of the real world and the future path of the economy can be affected by myriad unforeseen developments and events thus in setting the stance of monetary policy participants consider not only what appears to be the most likely economic outcome as em bodied in their projections but also the range of alternative possibilities the likelihood of their occurring and the poten tial costs to the economy should they occur table summarizes the average historical accuracy of a range of forecasts including those reported in past monetary policy reports and those prepared by the federal reserve boards staff in advance of meetings of the federal open market committee fomc the projection error ranges shown in the table illustrate the considerable uncertainty as sociated with economic forecasts for example suppose a participant projects that real gross domestic product gdp and total consumer prices will rise steadily at annual rates of respectively percent and percent if the uncertainty at tending those projections is similar to that experienced in the past and the risks around the projections are broadly bal anced the numbers reported in table would imply a prob ability of about percent that actual gdp would expand within a range of to percent in the current year to percent in the second year to percent in the third year and to percent in the fourth year the corre sponding percent confidence intervals for overall infla tion would be to percent in the current year to percent in the second year and to percent in the third and fourth years figures a through c illustrate these confidence bounds in fan charts that are symmetric and centered on the medians of fomc participants projec tions for gdp growth the unemployment rate and infla tion however in some instances the risks around the pro jections may not be symmetric in particular the unemploy ment rate cannot be negative furthermore the risks around a particular projection might be tilted to either the upside or the downside in which case the corresponding fan chart would be asymmetrically positioned around the median pro jection because current conditions may differ from those that prevailed on average over history participants provide judgments as to whether the uncertainty attached to their projections of each economic variable is greater than smaller than or broadly similar to typical levels of forecast uncer tainty seen in the past years as presented in table and reflected in the widths of the confidence intervals shown in the top panels of figures a through c participants cur rent assessments of the uncertainty surrounding their projec tions are summarized in the bottomleft panels of those fig ures participants also provide judgments as to whether the risks to their projections are weighted to the upside are weighted to the downside or are broadly balanced that is while the symmetric historical fan charts shown in the top panels of figures a through c imply that the risks to par ticipants projections are balanced participants may judge that there is a greater risk that a given variable will be above rather than below their projections these judgments are summa rized in the lowerright panels of figures a through c as with real activity and inflation the outlook for the future path of the federal funds rate is subject to considerable uncertainty this uncertainty arises primarily because each participants assessment of the appropriate stance of mone tary policy depends importantly on the evolution of real ac tivity and inflation over time if economic conditions evolve in an unexpected manner then assessments of the appropri ate setting of the federal funds rate would change from that point forward the final line in table shows the error ranges for forecasts of shortterm interest rates they suggest that the historical confidence intervals associated with projections of the federal funds rate are quite wide it should be noted however that these confidence intervals are not strictly con sistent with the projections for the federal funds rate as these projections are not forecasts of the most likely quarterly out comes but rather are projections of participants individual as sessments of appropriate monetary policy and are on an end ofyear basis however the forecast errors should provide a sense of the uncertainty around the future path of the federal funds rate generated by the uncertainty about the macroeco nomic variables as well as additional adjustments to monetary policy that would be appropriate to offset the effects of shocks to the economy if at some point in the future the confidence interval around the federal funds rate were to extend below zero it would be truncated at zero for purposes of the fan chart shown in figure zero is the bottom of the lowest target range for the federal funds rate that has been adopted by the committee in the past this approach to the construction of the federal funds rate fan chart would be merely a convention it would not have any implications for possible future policy decisions regarding the use of negative interest rates to pro vide additional monetary policy accommodation if doing so were appropriate in such situations the committee could also employ other tools including forward guidance and asset purchases to provide additional accommodation while figures a through c provide information on the uncertainty around the economic projections figure provides information on the range of views across fomc participants a comparison of figure with figures a through c shows that the dispersion of the projections across participants is much smaller than the average forecast errors over the past years page federal open

frameworks committee participants resumed their discussion of po tential longrun frameworks for monetary policy imple mentation a topic last discussed at the november fomc meeting the staff provided briefings that de scribed changes in recent years in banks uses of re serves outlined tradeoffs associated with potential choices of operating regimes to implement monetary policy and control shortterm interest rates reviewed potential choices of the policy target rate and summa rized developments in the policy implementation frame works of other central banks attended wednesday session only page federal open market committee the staff noted that banks liquidity management prac tices had changed markedly since the financial crisis with large banks now maintaining substantial buffers of reserves among other highquality liquid assets to meet potential outflows and to comply with regulatory re quirements information from bank contacts as well as a survey of banks indicated that in an environment in which money market interest rates were very close to the interest rate paid on excess reserve balances banks would likely be comfortable operating with much lower levels of reserve balances than at present but would wish to maintain substantially higher levels of balances than before the crisis on average survey responses sug gested that banks might reduce their reserve holdings only modestly from those lowest comfortable levels if money market interest rates were somewhat above the interest on excess reserves ioer rate across banks however individual survey responses on this issue varied substantially the staff highlighted how changes in the determinants of reserve demand since the crisis could affect the tradeoffs between two types of operating regimes one in which aggregate excess reserves are suffi ciently limited that money market interest rates are sen sitive to small changes in the supply of reserves and one in which aggregate excess reserves are suffi ciently abundant that money market interest rates are not sensitive to small changes in reserve supply in the for mer type of regime the federal reserve actively adjusts reserve supply in order to keep its policy rate close to target this technique worked well before the financial crisis when reserve demand was fairly stable in the ag gregate and largely influenced by payment needs and re serve requirements however with the increased use of reserves for precautionary liquidity purposes following the crisis there was some uncertainty about whether banks demand for reserves would now be sufficiently predictable for the federal reserve to be able to pre cisely target an interest rate in this way in the latter type of regime money market interest rates are not sensitive to small fluctuations in the demand for and supply of reserves and the stance of monetary policy is instead transmitted from the federal reserves administered rates to market ratesan approach that has been effec tive in controlling shortterm interest rates in the united states since the financial crisis as well as in other coun tries where central banks have used this approach the staff briefings also examined the tradeoffs between alternative policy rates that the committee could choose in each of the regimes in a regime of limited excess reserves the federal reserves policy tools most directly affect overnight unsecured rates paid by banks such as the effective federal funds rate effr and the over night bank funding rate obfr these rates could also be targeted with abundant excess reserves as could in terest rates on secured funding or a mixture of secured and unsecured rates participants commented on the advantages of a regime of policy implementation with abundant excess reserves based on experience over recent years such a regime was seen as providing good control of shortterm money market rates in a variety of market conditions and effec tive transmission of those rates to broader financial con ditions participants commented that by contrast inter est rate control might be difficult to achieve in an oper ating regime of limited excess reserves in view of the po tentially greater unpredictability of reserve demand re sulting from liquidity regulations or changes in risk ap petite or the increased variability of factors affecting re serve supply participants also observed that regimes with abundant excess reserves could provide effective control of shortterm rates even if large amounts of li quidity needed to be added to address liquidity strains or if largescale asset purchases needed to be undertaken to provide macroeconomic stimulus in situations where shortterm rates are at their effective lower bound monetary policy operations in this regime would also not require active management of reserve supply in addi tion the provision of sizable quantities of reserves could enhance financial stability and reduce operational risks in the payment system by maintaining a high level of li quidity in the banking system a number of participants commented that the attractive features of a regime of abundant excess reserves should be weighed against the potential drawbacks of such a re gime as well as the potential benefits of returning to a regime similar to that employed before the financial cri sis potential drawbacks of an abundant reserves regime included challenges in precisely determining the quantity of reserves necessary in such systems the need to main tain relatively sizable quantities of reserves and holdings of securities and relatively large ongoing interest ex penses associated with the remuneration of reserves some noted that returning to a regime of limited excess reserves could demonstrate the federal reserves ability to fully unwind the policies used to respond to the crisis and might thereby increase public acceptance or effec tiveness of such policies in the future participants noted that the level of reserve balances required to remain in a regime where rate control does not entail active manage ment of the supply of reserves was quite uncertain but minutes of the meeting of november page they thought that reserve supply could be reduced sub stantially below its current level while remaining in such a regime they expected to learn more about the de mand for reserves as the balance sheet continued to shrink in a gradual and predictable manner they also observed that it might be possible to adopt strategies that provide incentives for banks to reduce their demand for reserves participants judged that if the level of re serves needed for a regime with abundant excess re serves turned out to be considerably higher than antici pated the possibility of returning to a regime in which excess reserves were limited and adjustments in reserve supply were used to influence money market rates would warrant further consideration participants noted that lending in the federal funds mar ket was currently dominated by the federal home loan banks fhlbs participants cited several potential ben efits of targeting the obfr rather than the effr the larger volume of transactions and greater variety of lend ers underlying the obfr could make that rate a broader and more robust indicator of banks overnight funding costs the obfr could become an even better indicator after the potential incorporation of data on onshore wholesale deposits and the similarity of the obfr and the effr suggested that transitioning to the obfr would not require significant changes in the way the committee conducted and communicated monetary policy some participants saw it as desirable to explore the possibility of targeting a secured interest rate some also expressed interest in studying over the longer term approaches in which the committee would target a mix ture of secured and unsecured rates participants expected to continue their discussion of longrun implementation frameworks and related issues at upcoming meetings they emphasized that it would be important to communicate clearly the rationale for any choice of operating regime and target interest rate developments in financial markets and open mar ket operations the manager of the system open market account soma reviewed recent developments in domestic and global financial markets the equity market was quite volatile over the intermeeting period with us stock prices down as much as percent at one point before recovering somewhat investors pointed to a number of uncertainties in the global outlook that may have con tributed to the decline in stock prices including ongoing trade tensions between the united states and china growing concerns about the fiscal position of the italian government and its broader implications for financial markets and institutions and some worries about the outcome of the brexit negotiations market contacts also noted some nervousness about corporate earnings growth and an increase in longerterm treasury yields over recent weeks as factors contributing to downward pressure on equity prices the volatility in equity mar kets was accompanied by a rise in risk spreads on corpo rate debt although the widening in risk spreads was not as notable as in some past stock market downturns on balance the turbulence in equity markets did not leave much imprint on nearterm us monetary policy expectations respondents to the open market desks recent survey of primary dealers and survey of market participants indicated that respondents placed high odds on a further quarterpoint increase in the target range for the federal funds rate at the december fomc meeting that expectation also seemed to be embedded in federal funds futures quotes further out the median of survey respondents modal expectations for the path of the fed eral funds rate pointed to about three additional policy firmings next year while futures quotes appeared to be pricing in a somewhat flatter trajectory the manager also reviewed recent developments in global markets in china investors were concerned about the apparent slowing of economic expansion and the implications of continued trade tensions with the united states chinese stock price indexes declined fur ther over the intermeeting period and were off nearly percent on the year to date the renminbi continued to depreciate moving closer to renminbi per dol lara level that some market participants viewed as a possible trigger for intensifying depreciation pressures anecdotal reports suggested that chinese authorities had intervened to support the renminbi the deputy manager followed with a discussion of re cent developments in money markets and desk opera tions the effr along with other overnight rates edged higher over the weeks following the increase in the target range at the previous meeting most recently the effr had risen to the level of the ioer rate placing it basis points below the top of the target range the upward pressure on the effr and other money market rates re portedly stemmed partly from a sizable increase in treasury bill supply and a corresponding increase in treasury bill yields in part reflecting that development fhlbs shifted the composition of their liquidity portfo lios away from overnight lending in the federal funds market in favor of the higher returns on overnight re purchase agreements and on interestbearing deposit ac counts at banks these reallocations in their liquidity page federal open market committee portfolios in turn contributed to upward pressure on the effr at the same time anecdotal reports suggested that some depositories were seeking to increase their borrowing in federal funds from fhlbs partly because of the favorable treatment of such borrowing under li quidity regulations in addition rates on term borrowing had moved higher over recent weeks perhaps encourag ing some depositories to bid up rates on overnight fed eral funds loans to date there were no clear signs that the ongoing decline in reserve balances in the banking system associated with the gradual normalization of the federal reserves balance sheet had contributed mean ingfully to the upward pressure on money market rates indeed banks reportedly were willing to reduce reserve holdings in order to lend in overnight repurchase agree ment repo markets at rates just a few basis points above the ioer rate however respondents to the desks recent survey of primary dealers and survey of market participants indi cated that they anticipated the reduction in the supply of reserves in the banking system could become a very im portant factor influencing the spread between the ioer rate and the effr over the last three quarters of next year the deputy manager also provided an update on plans to incorporate additional data on overnight depos its in the obfr banks had begun reporting new data on onshore overnight deposits in october in aggregate the volumes reported in onshore overnight deposits were substantial and the rates reported for these instru ments were very close to rates reported on overnight eu rodollar transactions the new data were expected to be incorporated in the calculation of the obfr later next year following the desk briefings the chairman noted the upward trend in the effr relative to the ioer rate over the intermeeting period and suggested that it might be appropriate to implement another technical adjust ment in the ioer rate relative to the top of the target range for the federal funds rate fairly soon while the funds rate seemed to have stabilized recently there re mained some risk that it could continue to drift higher before the committees next meeting as a contingency plan participants agreed that it would be appropriate for the board to implement such a technical adjustment in the ioer rate before the december meeting if neces sary to keep the federal funds rate well within the target range established by the fomc by unanimous vote the committee ratified the desks domestic transactions over the intermeeting period there were no intervention operations in foreign curren cies for the systems account

provided its latest report on potential risks to financial stability the report again characterized the fi nancial vulnerabilities of the us financial system as moderate on balance this overall assessment incorpo rated the staffs judgment that vulnerabilities associated with asset valuation pressures continued to be elevated that vulnerabilities from financialsector leverage and maturity and liquidity transformation remained low and that vulnerabilities from household leverage were still in the lowtomoderate range additionally the staff judged vulnerabilities from leverage in the nonfinancial business sector as elevated and noted a pickup in the is suance of risky debt and the continued deterioration in underwriting standards on leveraged loans the staff also characterized overall vulnerabilities to foreign finan cial stability as moderate while highlighting specific is sues in some foreign economies includingdepending on the countryhigh private or sovereign debt burdens external vulnerabilities and political uncertainties staff economic outlook in the us economic forecast prepared for the novem ber fomc meeting the staff continued to project that real gdp would increase a little less rapidly in the sec ond half of the year than in the first half hurricanes florence and michael had devastating effects on many communities but they appeared likely to leave essentially no imprint on the national economy in the second half of the year as a whole relative to the forecast prepared for the previous meeting the projection for real gdp growth this year was little revised over the pe riod output was forecast to rise at a rate above or at the staffs estimate of potential growth and then slow to a pace below it in the unemployment rate was pro jected to decline further below the staffs estimate of its longerrun natural rate but to bottom out in and begin to edge up in the mediumterm projection for real gdp growth was only a bit weaker than in the previous forecast primarily reflecting a lower projected path for equity prices leaving the unemployment rate forecast little revised with labor market conditions al ready tight the staff continued to assume that projected employment gains would manifest in smallerthanusual downward pressure on the unemployment rate and in largerthanusual upward pressure on the labor force participation rate the staff expected both total and core pce price infla tion to remain close to percent through the medium term the staffs forecasts for both total and core pce price inflation were little revised on net the staff viewed the uncertainty around its projections for real gdp growth the unemployment rate and infla tion as similar to the average of the past years the staff also saw the risks to the forecasts for real gdp growth and the unemployment rate as balanced on the upside household spending and business investment could expand faster than the staff projected supported in part by the tax cuts enacted last year on the down side trade policies and foreign economic developments could move in directions that have significant negative effects on us economic growth risks to the inflation projection also were seen as balanced the upside risk that inflation could increase more than expected in an economy that was projected to move further above its potential was counterbalanced by the downside risk that longerterm inflation expectations may be lower than was assumed in the staff forecast participants view on current conditions and the economic outlook in their discussion of the economic situation and the outlook meeting participants agreed that information received since the fomc met in september indicated that the labor market had continued to strengthen and that economic activity had been rising at a strong rate job gains had been strong on average in recent months and the unemployment rate had declined household spending had continued to grow strongly while growth of business fixed investment had moderated from its rapid pace earlier in the year on a month basis both overall inflation and core inflation which excludes changes in food and energy prices had remained near percent indicators of longerterm inflation expecta tions were little changed on balance based on recent readings on spending prices and the labor market participants generally indicated little change in their assessment of the economic outlook with abovetrend economic growth expected to con tinue before slowing to a pace closer to trend over the medium term participants pointed to several factors supporting abovetrend growth including strong em ployment gains expansionary federal tax and spending policies and continued high levels of consumer and business confidence several participants observed that the stimulative effects of fiscal policy would likely dimin ish over time while the lagged effects of reductions in monetary policy accommodation would show through page federal open market committee more fully with both factors contributing to their expec tation that economic growth would slow to a pace closer to trend in their discussion of the household sector participants generally continued to characterize consumption growth as strong this view was supported by reports from dis trict contacts which were mostly upbeat regarding con sumer spending although household spending overall was seen as strong most participants noted weakness in residential investment this weakness was attributed to a variety of factors including increased mortgage rates building cost increases and supply constraints participants observed that growth in business fixed in vestment slowed in the third quarter following several quarters of rapid growth some participants pointed to anecdotal evidence regarding higher tariffs and uncer tainty about trade policy slowing global demand rising input costs or higher interest rates as possible factors contributing to the slowdown a couple of others noted that business investment growth can be volatile on a quarterly basis and factors such as the recent cuts in cor porate taxes and high levels of business sentiment were expected to support investment going forward reports from district contacts in the manufacturing en ergy and service sectors were generally favorable though growth in manufacturing activity was reportedly moderating in a couple of districts business contacts generally remained optimistic about the outlook but concerns about trade policy slowing foreign demand and labor shortages were reportedly weighing on busi ness prospects contacts in the agricultural sector re ported that conditions remain depressed in part due to the effects of trade policy actions on exports and farm incomes participants agreed that labor market conditions had strengthened further over the intermeeting period pay rolls had increased strongly in october and measures of labor market tightness such as rates of job openings and quits continued to be elevated the unemployment rate remained at a historically low level in october and the labor force participation rate moved up a couple of participants saw scope for further increases in the labor force participation rate as the strong economy pulled more workers into the labor market while a couple of other participants judged that there was little scope for significant further increases contacts in many districts continued to report tight la bor markets with difficulties finding qualified workers in some cases firms were responding to these difficul ties by increasing training for lessqualified workers out sourcing work or automating production while in other cases firms were responding by raising wages contacts in a couple of districts indicated that labor shortages particularly for skilled labor might be constraining activ ity in certain industries participants observed that at the national level measures of nominal wage growth ap peared to be picking up many participants noted that the recent pace of aggregate wage gains was broadly con sistent with trends in productivity growth and inflation participants observed that both overall and core pce price inflation remained near percent on a month basis in general participants viewed recent price devel opments as consistent with their expectation that infla tion would remain near the committees symmetric percent objective on a sustained basis reports from business contacts and surveys in a number of districts were consistent with some firming in inflationary pres sure contacts in many districts indicated that input costs had risen and that increased tariffs were raising costs especially for industries relying heavily on steel and aluminum in a few districts transportation costs had reportedly increased some contacts indicated that while input costs were higher it appeared that the pass through of these higher costs to consumer prices was limited participants commented on a number of risks and un certainties associated with their outlook for economic activity the labor market and inflation over the medium term a few participants indicated that uncertainty had increased recently pointing to the high levels of uncer tainty regarding the effects of fiscal and trade policies on economic activity and inflation some participants viewed economic and financial developments abroad including the possibility of further appreciation of the us dollar as posing downside risks for domestic eco nomic growth and inflation a couple of participants expressed the concern that measures of inflation expec tations would remain low particularly if economic growth slowed more than expected several participants were concerned that the high level of debt in the nonfi nancial business sector and especially the high level of leveraged loans made the economy more vulnerable to a sharp pullback in credit availability which could exac erbate the effects of a negative shock on economic ac tivity the potential for an escalation in tariffs or trade tensions was also cited as a factor that could slow eco nomic growth more than expected with regard to up side risks participants noted that greaterthanexpected effects of fiscal stimulus and high consumer confidence minutes of the meeting of november page could lead to strongerthanexpected economic out comes some participants raised the concern that tight ening resource utilization in conjunction with an in crease in the ability of firms to pass through increases in tariffs or in other input costs to consumer prices could generate undesirable upward pressure on inflation in general participants agreed that risks to the outlook ap peared roughly balanced in their discussion of financial developments partici pants observed that financial conditions tightened over the intermeeting period as equity prices declined longerterm yields and borrowing costs for most sectors increased and the foreign exchange value of the dollar rose despite these developments a number of partici pants judged that financial conditions remained accom modative relative to historical norms among those who commented on financial stability a number cited possible risks related to elevated cre prices narrow corporate bond spreads or strong issu ance of leveraged loans a few participants suggested that some of these financial vulnerabilities might not currently represent risks to financial stability so much as they represent downside risks to the economic outlook a couple of participants suggested that financial stability risks and risks to the outlook are interconnected a cou ple of participants also commented on the upcoming re lease of the boards first public financial stability report and noted that the report would increase the transpar ency of the federal reserves financial stability work as well as enhance communications on this topic in their discussion of monetary policy participants agreed that it would be appropriate to maintain the cur rent target range for the federal funds rate at this meet ing participants generally judged that the economy had been evolving about as they had anticipated with eco nomic activity rising at a strong rate labor market con ditions continuing to strengthen and inflation running at or near the committees longerrun objective almost all participants reaffirmed the view that further gradual increases in the target range for the federal funds rate would likely be consistent with sustaining the commit tees objectives of maximum employment and price sta bility consistent with their judgment that a gradual approach to policy normalization remained appropriate almost all participants expressed the view that another increase in the target range for the federal funds rate was likely to be warranted fairly soon if incoming information on the labor market and inflation was in line with or stronger than their current expectations however a few partici pants while viewing further gradual increases in the tar get range of the federal funds rate as likely to be appro priate expressed uncertainty about the timing of such increases a couple of participants noted that the federal funds rate might currently be near its neutral level and that further increases in the federal funds rate could un duly slow the expansion of economic activity and put downward pressure on inflation and inflation expecta tions participants emphasized that the committees approach to setting the stance of policy should be importantly guided by incoming data and their implications for the economic outlook they noted that their expectations for the path of the federal funds rate were based on their current assessment of the economic outlook monetary policy was not on a preset course if incoming infor mation prompted meaningful reassessments of the eco nomic outlook and attendant risks either to the upside or the downside their policy outlook would change various factors such as the recent tightening in financial conditions risks in the global outlook and some signs of slowing in interestsensitive sectors of the economy on the one hand and further indicators of tightness in labor markets and possible inflationary pressures on the other hand were noted in this context participants also commented on how the committees communications in its postmeeting statement might need to be revised at coming meetings particularly the language referring to the committees expectations for further gradual in creases in the target range for the federal funds rate many participants indicated that it might be appropriate at some upcoming meetings to begin to transition to statement language that placed greater emphasis on the evaluation of incoming data in assessing the economic and policy outlook such a change would help to convey the committees flexible approach in responding to changing economic circumstances committee policy action in their discussion of monetary policy for the period ahead members judged that information received since the committee met in september indicated that the la bor market had continued to strengthen and that eco nomic activity had been rising at a strong rate job gains had been strong on average in recent months and the unemployment rate had declined household spending had

bank of minneapolis longrun monetary policy implementation frameworks committee participants resumed their discussion from the november fomc meeting of potential long run frameworks for monetary policy implementation at the december meeting the staff provided a set of briefings that considered various issues related to the transition to a longrun operating regime with lower lev els of excess reserves than at present and to a longrun composition of the balance sheet the staff noted that during the transition to a longrun operating regime with excess reserves below current lev els the effective federal funds rate effr could begin to rise a little above the interest on excess reserves ioer rate as reserves in the banking system declined gradually to a level that the committee judges to be most appropriate for efficient and effective implementation of policy this upward movement in the federal funds rate attended the discussion of financial developments and open market operations through the close of the meeting attended tuesday session only page federal open market committee could be gradual however the staff noted that the fed eral funds rate and other money market rates could pos sibly become somewhat volatile at times as banks and financial markets adjusted to lower levels of reserve bal ances were upward pressures on the federal funds rate to emerge it could be challenging to distinguish between pressures that were transitory and likely to abate as fi nancial institutions adjust and those that were more per sistent and associated with aggregate reserve scarcity the staff reported on the monitoring of conditions in money markets as well as various survey and market out reach activities that could assist in detecting reserve scar city the staff reviewed a number of steps that the fed eral reserve could take to ensure effective monetary pol icy implementation were upward pressures on the fed eral funds rate and other money market rates to emerge these steps included lowering the ioer rate further within the target range using the discount window to support the efficient distribution of reserves and slow ing or smoothing the pace of reserve decline through open market operations or through slowing portfolio re demptions the staff also discussed new ceiling tools that could help keep the effr within the committees target range including options that would add new counterparties for the open market desks operations the staff also provided a review of the liabilities on the federal reserves balance sheet the review described the factors that influence the size of reserve and nonreserve liabilities and discussed the increase in the size of these liabilities since the financial crisis additionally the staff outlined various issues related to the longrun composi tion of the system open market account soma port folio including the maturity composition of the portfo lios treasury securities and the management of residual holdings of agency mortgagebacked securities mbs after the committee has normalized the size of the bal ance sheet in discussing the transition to a longrun operating re gime participants commented on the advantages and disadvantages of allowing reserves to decline to a level that could put noticeable upward pressure on the federal funds rate at least for a time reducing reserves close to the lowest level that still corresponded to the flat por tion of the reserve demand curve would be one ap proach consistent with the committees previously stated intention in the policy normalization principles and plans that it issued in to hold no more secu rities than necessary to implement monetary policy effi ciently and effectively however reducing reserves to a point very close to the level at which the reserve de mand curve begins to slope upward could lead to a sig nificant increase in the volatility in shortterm interest rates and require frequent sizable open market opera tions or new ceiling facilities to maintain effective inter est rate control these considerations suggested that it might be appropriate to instead provide a buffer of re serves sufficient to ensure that the federal reserve op erates consistently on the flat portion of the reserve de mand curve so as to promote the efficient and effective implementation of monetary policy participants discussed options for maintaining control of interest rates should upward pressures on money market rates emerge during the transition to a regime with lower excess reserves several participants commented on op tions that rely on existing or currently used tools such as further technical adjustments to the ioer rate to keep the federal funds rate within the target range or us ing the discount window although such options were recognized to have limitations in some situations some participants commented on the possibility of slowing the pace of the decline in reserves in approaching the longer run level of reserves standard temporary open market operations could be used for this purpose in addition participants discussed options such as ending portfolio redemptions with a relatively high level of reserves still in the system and then either maintaining that level of reserves or allowing growth in nonreserve liabilities to very gradually reduce reserves further these ap proaches could allow markets and banks more time to adjust to lower reserve levels while maintaining effective control of interest rates several participants however expressed concern that a slowing of redemptions could be misinterpreted as a signal about the stance of mone tary policy some participants expressed an interest in learning more about possible options for new ceiling tools to provide firmer control of the policy rate participants commented on the role that the federal re serves nonreserve liabilities have played in the expan sion of the federal reserves balance sheet since the fi nancial crisis many participants noted that the magni tudes of these nonreserve liabilitiesmost significantly currency but also liabilities to the treasury through the treasury general account and liabilities to foreign offi cial institutions through their accounts at the federal re serveare not closely related to federal reserve mone tary policy decisions they also remarked that the size of the federal reserves balance sheet was expected to increase over time as the growth of these liabilities roughly tracks the growth of nominal gross domestic product gdp additionally participants cited the so cial benefits provided by these liabilities to the economy minutes of the meeting of december page participants considered it important to present infor mation on the federal reserves balance sheet to the public in ways that communicated these facts in dis cussing the longrun level of reserve liabilities partici pants noted that it might be useful to explore ways to encourage banks to reduce their demand for reserves and to provide information to banks and the public about the likely longrun level of reserves participants commented on a number of issues related to the longrun composition of the soma portfolio with regard to the portfolio of treasury securities par ticipants discussed the advantages of different portfolio maturity compositions several participants noted that a portfolio of holdings weighted toward shorter maturities would provide greater flexibility to lengthen maturity if warranted by an economic downturn while a couple of others noted that a portfolio with maturities that matched the outstanding treasury market would have a more neutral effect on the market with regard to the mbs portfolio participants noted that the passive run off of mbs holdings through principal paydowns would continue for many years after the size of the balance sheet had been normalized several participants com mented on the possibility of reducing agency mbs hold ings somewhat more quickly than the passive approach by implementing a program of very gradual mbs sales sometime after the size of the balance sheet had been normalized participants expected to continue their discussion of longrun implementation frameworks and related issues at upcoming meetings they reiterated the importance of communicating clearly on the rationale for any deci sion made on the implementation framework developments in financial markets and open mar ket operations the soma manager reviewed developments in financial markets over the intermeeting period asset prices were volatile in recent weeks reportedly reflecting a pullback from risktaking by investors in part the deterioration in risk sentiment appeared to stem importantly from un certainty about the state of trade negotiations between china and the united states in addition investors pointed to concerns about the global growth outlook the unsettled state of brexit negotiations and uncertain ties about the political situation in europe against this backdrop us stock prices were down nearly percent on the period risk spreads on corpo rate bonds widened appreciably with market partici pants reportedly focusing on the potential implications of downside risks to the us economic outlook for the financial condition of companies particularly for com panies at the lower end of the investmentgrade spec trum treasury yields declined significantly especially at longer maturities contributing to some flattening of the treasury yield curve based on readings from treasury inflationprotected securities tips the decline in nominal treasury yields was associated with a notable drop in inflation compensation a sizable decline in oil prices was cited as an important factor contributing to the drop in measures of inflation compensation the deterioration in market sentiment was accompanied by a significant downward revision in the expected path of the federal funds rate based on federal funds futures quotes in addition futuresbased measures of policy expectations moved lower in response to speeches by federal reserve officials the revision in the expected policy path was less noticeable in the desks survey based measures of the expected path of the federal funds rate desk surveys indicated that respondents placed high odds on a further quarterpoint firming in the stance of monetary policy at the december meeting but lower than the near certainty of a rate increase reported just before previous policy firmings in survey re sponses anticipated that the median projected path of the federal funds rate in the summary of economic pro jections sep would show only two additional quarter point policy firmings next yeardown from the three policy firmings in the median path in the september sep results the deputy manager followed with a discussion of money market developments and open market opera tions after a fast narrowing of the spread between the ioer rate and the effr before the november meet ing the effr had remained stable at or just basis point below the level of the ioer rate since then some upward pressures on overnight rates were evident in the repurchase

some strongerthanexpected incoming data on economic activity and the recent tightening in financial conditions particularly the decline in equity prices the us economic forecast prepared by the staff for the de cember fomc meeting was little revised on balance the staff continued to expect that real gdp growth would be strong in the fourth quarter of although somewhat slower than the rapid pace of growth in the previous two quarters over the period real gdp was forecast to rise at a rate above the staffs esti mate of potential output growth and then slow to a pace below it in the unemployment rate was projected to decline further below the staffs estimate of its longer run natural rate but to bottom out by and begin to edge up in with labor market conditions already tight the staff continued to assume that projected em ployment gains would manifest in smallerthanusual downward pressure on the unemployment rate and in largerthanusual upward pressure on the labor force participation rate the staff expected both total and core pce price infla tion to be just a touch below percent in with total inflation revised down a bit because of recent declines in consumer energy prices core pce price inflation was forecast to move up to percent in and remain at that level through the medium term total inflation was forecast to be a little below core inflation in re flecting projected declines in energy prices and then to run at the same level as core inflation over the following two years the staffs mediumterm projections for both total and core pce price inflation were little revised on net the staff viewed the uncertainty around its projections for real gdp growth the unemployment rate and infla tion as similar to the average of the past years the staff also saw the risks to the forecasts for real gdp growth and the unemployment rate as balanced on the upside household spending and business investment could expand faster than the staff projected supported in part by the tax cuts enacted last year on the down side trade policies and foreign economic developments could move in directions that have significant negative effects on us economic growth risks to the inflation minutes of the meeting of december page projection also were seen as balanced the upside risk that inflation could increase more than expected in an economy that was projected to move further above its potential was counterbalanced by the downside risk that longerterm inflation expectations may be lower than was assumed in the staff forecast participants views on current conditions and the economic outlook in conjunction with this fomc meeting members of the board of governors and federal reserve bank pres idents submitted their projections of the most likely out comes for real gdp growth the unemployment rate and inflation for each year from through and over the longer run based on their individual assess ments of the appropriate path for the federal funds rate the longerrun projections represented each partici pants assessment of the rate to which each variable would be expected to converge over time under appro priate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy these projections and policy assessments are described in the sep which is an ad dendum to these minutes in their discussion of the economic situation and the outlook meeting participants agreed that information received since the fomc met in november indicated that the labor market had continued to strengthen and that economic activity had been rising at a strong rate job gains had been strong on average in recent months and the unemployment rate had remained low house hold spending had continued to grow strongly while growth of business fixed investment had moderated from its rapid pace earlier in the year on a month basis both overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy remained near percent indica tors of longerterm inflation expectations were little changed on balance in assessing the economic outlook participants noted the contrast between the strength of incoming data on economic activity and the concerns about downside risks evident in financial markets and in reports from business contacts recent readings on household and business spending inflation and labor market condi tions were largely in line with participants expectations and indicated continued strength of the economy by contrast financial markets were volatile and conditions had tightened over the intermeeting period with sizable declines in equity prices and notably wider corporate credit spreads coinciding with a continued flattening of the treasury yield curve in part these changes in finan cial conditions appeared to reflect greater concerns about the global economic outlook participants also re ported hearing more frequent concerns about the global economic outlook from business contacts after taking into account incoming economic data in formation from business contacts and the tightening of financial conditions participants generally revised down their individual assessments of the appropriate path for monetary policy and indicated either no material change or only a modest downward revision in their assessment of the economic outlook economic growth was ex pected to remain above trend in and then slow to a pace closer to trend over the medium term partici pants who downgraded their assessment of the eco nomic outlook pointed to a variety of factors underlying their assessment including recent financial market de velopments some softening in the foreign economic growth outlook or a more pessimistic outlook for housingsector activity in their discussion of the household sector participants generally characterized real pce growth as remaining strong participants pointed to a number of factors that were supporting consumer spending including further gains in wages and household income reflecting a strong labor market expansionary federal tax policies still upbeat readings on consumer sentiment recent declines in oil prices and household balance sheets that generally remained healthy despite tighter financial conditions although household spending overall was seen as strong several participants noted continued weakness in residential investment this weakness was attributed to a variety of factors including increased mortgage rates and rising home prices reports from district contacts in the auto sector were mixed several participants noted that business fixed investment remained solid despite a slowdown in the third quarter as more recent data pointed to a rebound in investment spending business contacts in several districts reported robust activity through the end of and planned to follow through or expand on their current capital ex penditure projects however contacts in a number of districts appeared less upbeat than at the time of the november meeting as concerns about a variety of fac torsincluding trade policy waning fiscal stimulus slowing global economic growth or financial market volatilitywere reportedly beginning to weigh on busi ness sentiment a couple of participants commented that the recent decline in oil prices could be a sign of a weakening in global demand that could weigh on capital spending by oil production companies and affect com panies providing services to the oil industry however page federal open market committee a couple of participants noted that the recent oil price decline could also be associated with increasing oil sup ply rather than softening global demand contacts in the agricultural sector reported that condi tions remained depressed in part because of the effects of trade policy actions on exports and farm incomes un certainty about future trade agreements and continued low commodity prices banks continued to report a gradual increase in agricultural loan delinquencies in re cent months nonetheless participants cited a few re cent favorable developments including new trade miti gation payments as well as legislative action to maintain crop insurance that was seen as reducing uncertainty participants agreed that labor market conditions had re mained strong payrolls continued to grow at an above trend rate in november and measures of labor market tightness such as rates of job openings and quits contin ued to be elevated the unemployment rate remained at a historically low level in november and the labor force participation rate stayed steady which represented an improvement relative to its gradual downwardsloping underlying trend several participants observed that la bor force participation had been improving for low skilled workers and for primeage workers a couple of participants saw scope for further improvements in the labor force participation rate relative to its historical downward trend while a couple of others judged that there was little scope for significant further improve ments contacts in many districts continued to report tight la bor markets with difficulties finding qualified workers in some cases firms were responding to these difficul ties by using various types of nonwage incentives to at tract and retain workers while in other cases firms were responding by raising wages many participants ob served that at the national level most measures of nom inal wage growth had risen and were currently at levels that were broadly in line with trends in productivity growth and inflation participants observed that both overall and core pce price inflation remained near percent on a month basis but that core inflation had edged lower in recent months a few participants noted that the recent de clines in energy prices would likely only temporarily weigh on headline inflation several participants re marked that longerterm tipsbased inflation compen sation had declined notably since november concurrent with both falling oil prices and a deterioration in investor risk sentiment a few participants pointed to the decline in longerterm inflation compensation as an indication that longerrun inflation expectations may have edged lower while several others cited surveybased measures as suggesting that longerrun expectations likely re mained anchored participants generally continued to view recent price developments as consistent with their expectation that inflation would remain near the com mittees symmetric percent objective on a sustained basis although a few participants pointed to anecdotal and survey evidence indicating rising input costs and passthrough of these higher costs to consumer prices reports from business contacts and surveys in some other districts suggested some moderation in inflation ary pressure in their discussion of financial developments partici pants agreed that financial markets had been volatile and financial conditions had tightened over the intermeeting period as equity prices declined corporate credit spreads widened and the treasury yield curve continued to flatten some participants commented that these de velopments may reflect an increased focus among mar ket participants on tail risks such as a sharp escalation of trade tensions or could be a signal of a significant slow down in the pace of economic growth in the future a couple of participants noted that the tightening in finan cial conditions so far did not appear to be restraining real activity although a more persistent tightening would un doubtedly weigh on business and household spending participants agreed to continue to monitor financial market developments and assess the implications of these developments for the economic outlook participants commented on a number of risks associated with their outlook for economic activity the labor mar ket and inflation over the medium term various factors that could pose downside risks for domestic economic growth and inflation were mentioned including the pos sibilities of a sharperthanexpected slowdown in global economic growth a more rapid waning of fiscal stimu lus an escalation in trade tensions a further tightening of financial conditions or greaterthananticipated neg ative effects from the monetary policy tightening to date a few participants expressed concern that longerrun in flation expectations would remain low particularly if economic growth slowed more than expected with re gard to upside risks participants noted that the effects of fiscal stimulus could turn out to be greater than ex pected and the uncertainties surrounding trade tensions or the global growth outlook could be resolved favora bly leading to strongerthanexpected economic out comes while a couple of participants suggested that tightening resource utilization in conjunction with an in crease in the ability of firms to pass through increases in minutes of the meeting of december page input costs to consumer prices could generate undesira ble upward pressure on inflation a couple of partici pants pointed to risks to financial stability stemming from high levels of corporate borrowing especially by riskier firms and elevated cre prices in general par ticipants agreed that risks to the outlook appeared roughly balanced although some noted that downside risks may have increased of late in their consideration of monetary policy at this meeting participants generally judged that the economy was evolving about as anticipated with real economic activ ity rising at a strong rate labor market conditions con tinuing to strengthen and inflation near the committees objective based on their current assessments most par ticipants expressed the view that it would be appropriate for the committee to raise the target range for the fed eral funds rate basis points at this meeting a few participants however favored no change in the target range at this meeting judging that the absence of signs of upward inflation pressure afforded the committee some latitude to wait and see how the data would de velop amid the recent rise in financial market volatility and increased uncertainty about the global economic growth outlook with regard to the outlook for monetary policy beyond this meeting participants generally judged that some fur ther gradual increases in the target range for the federal funds rate would most likely be consistent with a sus tained economic expansion strong labor market condi tions and inflation near percent over the medium term with an increase in the target range at this meet ing the federal funds rate would be at or close to the lower end of the range of estimates of the longerrun neutral interest rate and participants expressed that re cent developments including the volatility in financial markets and the increased concerns about global growth made the appropriate extent and timing of future policy firming less clear than earlier against this backdrop many participants expressed the view that especially in an environment of muted inflation pressures the com mittee could afford to be patient about further policy firming a number of participants noted that before making further changes to the stance of policy it was important for the committee to assess factors such as how the risks that had become more pronounced in re cent months might unfold and to what extent they would affect economic activity and the effects of past actions to remove policy accommodation which were likely still working their way through the economy participants emphasized that the committees approach to setting the stance of policy should be importantly guided by the implications of incoming data for the eco nomic outlook they noted that their expectations for the path of the federal funds rate were based on their current assessment of the economic outlook monetary policy was not on a preset course neither the pace nor the ultimate endpoint of future rate increases was known if incoming information prompted meaningful reassessments of the economic outlook and attendant risks either to the upside or the downside their policy outlook would change various factors such as the re cent tightening in financial conditions and risks to the global outlook on the one hand and further indicators of tightness in labor markets and possible risks to finan cial stability from a prolonged period of tight resource utilization on the other hand were noted in this context participants discussed ideas for effectively communi cating to the public the committees datadependent ap proach including options for transitioning away from forward guidance language in future postmeeting state ments several participants expressed the view that it might be appropriate over upcoming meetings to re move forward guidance entirely and replace it with lan guage emphasizing the datadependent nature of policy decisions participants supported a plan to implement another technical adjustment to the ioer rate that would place it basis points below the top of the target range for the federal funds rate this adjustment would foster trading in the federal funds market at rates well within the fomcs target range committee policy action in their discussion of monetary policy for the period ahead members judged that information received since the committee met in november indicated that the la bor market had continued to strengthen and

previous meeting though financial conditions had tightened and page federal open market committee global growth had moderated members generally antic ipated that growth would remain above trend and

the federal funds rate would depend on their assessment of realized and expected economic condi tions relative to the committees maximum employment and symmetric percent inflation objectives they reit erated that this assessment would take into account a wide range of information including measures of labor market conditions indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations and readings on financial and in ternational developments more generally members noted that decisions regarding nearterm adjustments of the stance of monetary policy would appropriately re main dependent on the evolution of the outlook as in formed by incoming data with regard to the postmeeting statement members agreed to modify the phrase the committee expects that further gradual increases to read the committee judges that some further gradual increases the use of the word judges in the revised phrase was intended to better convey the datadependency of the committees decisions regarding the future stance of policy the ref erence to some further gradual increases was viewed as helping indicate that based on current information the committee judged that a relatively limited amount of additional tightening likely would be appropriate while members judged that the risks to the economic outlook were roughly balanced they decided that recent devel opments warranted emphasizing that the committee would continue to monitor global economic and finan cial developments and assess their implications for the economic outlook at the conclusion of the discussion the committee voted to authorize and

more than in september were in office at the time of the december meeting and submitted economic projections as shown in figure participants generally continued to expect that the evolution of the

the median projections for the federal funds rate for the end of through and over the longer run were a little lower most participants expected that the federal funds rate at the end of and would be

longerrun projections of the federal funds rate was percent basis points lower than in september in discussing their projections many participants con tinued to express the view that any further increases in the federal funds rate over the next few years would likely be gradual that anticipated pace reflected a few factors such as a shortterm neutral real interest rate that is currently low and an inflation rate that has been rising only gradually to the committees percent objective some participants cited a weaker nearterm trajectory for economic growth or a muted response of inflation

the up side in addition the balance of risks to the inflation projections shifted down slightly relative to september as one less participant judged the risks to both total and core inflation as weighted to the upside and one more participant viewed the risks as weighted to the downside in discussing the uncertainty and risks surrounding their economic projections participants mentioned trade ten sions as well as financial and foreign economic develop ments as sources of uncertainty or downside risk to the growth outlook for the inflation outlook the effects of trade restrictions were cited as upside risks and lower en ergy prices and the stronger dollar as downside risks those who commented on us fiscal policy viewed it as an additional source of uncertainty and noted that it might present twosided risks to the outlook as its ef fects could be waning faster than expected or turn out to be more stimulative than anticipated participants assessments of the appropriate future

government forecasts made over the previous years the condence interval is not strictly consistent with the projections for the federal funds rate primarily because these projections are not forecasts of the likeliest outcomes for the federal funds rate but rather projections of participants individual assessments of appropriate monetary policy still historical forecast errors provide a broad sense of the uncertainty around the future path of the federal funds rate generated by the uncertainty about the macroeconomic variables as well as additional adjustments to monetary policy that may be appropriate to oset the eects of shocks to the economy the condence interval is assumed to be symmetric except when it is truncated at zerothe bottom of the lowest target range for the federal funds rate that has been adopted in the past by the committee this truncation would not be intended to indicate the likelihood of the use of negative interest rates to provide additional monetary policy accommodation if doing so was judged appropriate in such situations the committee could also employ other tools including forward guidance and largescale asset purchases to provide additional

condence interval has been truncated at zero summary of economic projections of the meeting of december page forecast uncertainty the economic projections provided by the members of the board of governors and the presidents of the federal reserve banks inform discussions of monetary policy among policymakers and can aid public understanding of the basis for policy actions considerable uncertainty attends these projections however the economic and statistical models and relationships used to help produce economic forecasts are necessarily imperfect descriptions of the real world and the future path of the economy can be affected by myriad unforeseen developments and events thus in setting the stance of monetary policy participants consider not only what appears to be the most likely economic outcome as em bodied in their projections but also the range of alternative possibilities the likelihood of their occurring and the poten tial costs to the economy should they occur table summarizes the average historical accuracy of a range of forecasts including those reported in past monetary policy reports and those prepared by the federal reserve boards staff in advance of meetings of the federal open market committee fomc the projection error ranges shown in the table illustrate the considerable uncertainty as sociated with economic forecasts for example suppose a participant projects that real gross domestic product gdp and total consumer prices will rise steadily at annual rates of respectively percent and percent if the uncertainty at tending those projections is similar to that experienced in the past and the risks around the projections are broadly bal anced the numbers reported in table would imply a prob ability of about percent that actual gdp would expand within a range of to percent in the current year to percent in the second year and to percent in the third and fourth years the corresponding percent con fidence intervals for overall inflation would be to per cent in the current year and to percent in the second third and fourth years figures a through c illustrate these confidence bounds in fan charts that are symmetric and centered on the medians of fomc participants projec tions for gdp growth the unemployment rate and infla tion however in some instances the risks around the pro jections may not be symmetric in particular the unemploy ment rate cannot be negative furthermore the risks around a particular projection might be tilted to either the upside or the downside in which case the corresponding fan chart would be asymmetrically positioned around the median pro jection because current conditions may differ from those that prevailed on average over history participants provide judgments as to whether the uncertainty attached to their projections of each economic variable is greater than smaller than or broadly similar to typical levels of forecast uncer tainty seen in the past years as presented in table and reflected in the widths of the confidence intervals shown in the top panels of figures a through c participants cur rent assessments of the uncertainty surrounding their projec tions are summarized in the bottomleft panels of those fig ures participants also provide judgments as to whether the risks to their projections are weighted to the upside are weighted to the downside or are broadly balanced that is while the symmetric historical fan charts shown in the top panels of figures a through c imply that the risks to par ticipants projections are balanced participants may judge that there is a greater risk that a given variable will be above rather than below their projections these judgments are summa rized in the lowerright panels of figures a through c as with real activity and inflation the outlook for the future path of the federal funds rate is subject to considerable uncertainty this uncertainty arises primarily because each participants assessment of the appropriate stance of mone tary policy depends importantly on the evolution of real ac tivity and inflation over time if economic conditions evolve in an unexpected manner then assessments of the appropri ate setting of the federal funds rate would change from that point forward the final line in table shows the error ranges for forecasts of shortterm interest rates they suggest that the historical confidence intervals associated with projections of the federal funds rate are quite wide it should be noted however that these confidence intervals are not strictly con sistent with the projections for the federal funds rate as these projections are not forecasts of the most likely quarterly out comes but rather are projections of participants individual as sessments of appropriate monetary policy and are on an end ofyear basis however the forecast errors should provide a sense of the uncertainty around the future path of the federal funds rate generated by the uncertainty about the macroeco nomic variables as well as additional adjustments to monetary policy that would be appropriate to offset the effects of shocks to the economy if at some point in the future the confidence interval around the federal funds rate were to extend below zero it would be truncated at zero for purposes of the fan chart shown in figure zero is the bottom of the lowest target range for the federal funds rate that has been adopted by the committee in the past this approach to the construction of the federal funds rate fan chart would be merely a convention it would not have any implications for possible future policy decisions regarding the use of negative interest rates to pro vide additional monetary policy accommodation if doing so were appropriate in such situations the committee could also employ other tools including forward guidance and asset purchases to provide additional accommodation while figures a through c provide information on the uncertainty around the economic projections figure provides information on the range of views across fomc participants a comparison of figure with figures a through c shows that the dispersion of the projections across participants is much smaller than the average forecast errors over the past years page federal open market committee

gram for security of fomc information in the committees annual reconsideration of the state ment on longerrun goals and monetary policy strat egy participants agreed that only a minor revision was required at this meeting which was to update the refer ence to the median of fomc participants estimates of the longerrun normal rate of unemployment from percent to percent all participants supported the statement with the revision and the committee voted unanimously to approve the updated statement statement on longerrun goals and monetary policy strategy as amended effective january the federal open market committee fomc is firmly committed to fulfilling its statutory mandate from the congress of promoting maximum employment sta ble prices and moderate longterm interest rates the committee seeks to explain its monetary policy deci sions to the public as clearly as possible such clarity facilitates wellinformed decisionmaking by households and businesses reduces economic and financial uncer tainty increases the effectiveness of monetary policy and enhances transparency and accountability which are essential in a democratic society inflation employment and longterm interest rates fluctuate over time in response to economic and finan cial disturbances moreover monetary policy actions tend to influence economic activity and prices with a lag therefore the committees policy decisions reflect its longerrun goals its mediumterm outlook and its as sessments of the balance of risks including risks to the financial system that could impede the attainment of the committees goals the inflation rate over the longer run is primarily de termined by monetary policy and hence the committee has the ability to specify a longerrun goal for inflation the committee reaffirms its judgment that inflation at the rate of percent as measured by the annual change in the price index for personal consumption expendi tures is most consistent over the longer run with the federal reserves statutory mandate the committee would be concerned if inflation were running persis tently above or below this objective communicating page federal open market committee this symmetric inflation goal clearly to the public helps keep longerterm inflation expectations firmly anchored thereby fostering price stability and moderate longterm interest rates and enhancing the committees ability to promote maximum employment in the face of signifi cant economic disturbances the maximum level of em ployment is largely determined by nonmonetary factors that affect the structure and dynamics of the labor mar ket these factors may change over time and may not be directly measurable consequently it would not be appropriate to specify a fixed goal for employment ra ther the committees policy decisions must be informed by assessments of the maximum level of employment recognizing that such assessments are necessarily uncer tain and subject to revision the committee considers a wide range of indicators in making these assessments information about committee participants estimates of the longerrun normal rates of output growth and unem ployment is published four times per year in the fomcs summary of economic projections for ex ample in the most recent projections the median of fomc participants estimates of the longerrun normal rate of unemployment was percent in setting monetary policy the committee seeks to mitigate deviations of inflation from its longerrun goal and deviations of employment from the committees as sessments of its maximum level these objectives are generally complementary however under circum stances in which the committee judges that the objec tives are not complementary it follows a balanced ap proach in promoting them taking into account the mag nitude of the deviations and the potentially different time horizons over which employment and inflation are projected to return to levels judged consistent with its mandate the committee intends to reaffirm these principles and to make adjustments as appropriate at its annual organi zational meeting each january developments in financial markets and open mar ket operations the deputy manager of the system open market ac count soma provided an overview of developments in us and global financial markets financial markets were quite volatile over the intermeeting period market participants pointed to a number of factors as contrib uting to the heightened volatility and sustained declines in risk asset prices and interest rates over recent months including a weaker outlook and greater uncertainties for foreign economies particularly for europe and china perceptions of greater policy risks and the partial shut down of the federal government against this backdrop market participants appeared to interpret fomc com munications at the time of the december meeting as not fully appreciating the tightening of financial conditions and the associated downside risks to the us economic outlook that had emerged since the fall in addition some market reports suggested that investors perceived the fomc to be insufficiently flexible in its approach to adjusting the path for the federal funds rate or the pro cess for balance sheet normalization in light of those risks the deterioration in risk sentiment late in decem ber was reportedly amplified by poor liquidity and thin trading conditions around yearend early in the new year market sentiment improved fol lowing communications by federal reserve officials em phasizing that the committee could be patient in con sidering further adjustments to the stance of policy and that it would be flexible in managing the reduction of securities holdings in the soma on balance stock prices finished the period up almost percent while cor porate risk spreads narrowed reversing a portion of the changes in these variables since the september fomc meeting the deputy manager reported results from the open market desks latest surveys of primary dealers and mar ket participants regarding the outlook for policy the median path for the federal funds rate among respond ents had shifted down about basis points relative to the responses from the surveys conducted ahead of the december meeting moreover the average probability that respondents attached to an increase in the target range as the next policy action declined and the corre sponding probabilities they attached to the possibility that the target range would be unchanged or lowered at some point this year increased concerning expectations for the fomc statement many survey respondents an ticipated the retention of language pointing to the likeli hood of some further gradual increases in the target range for the federal funds rate but many also expected the statement to emphasize patience or data dependence in the conduct of policy consistent with recent com munications that the fomc would be flexible in its ap proach to balance sheet normalization the survey results also suggested that the respondents anticipated that the committee would slow the balance sheet runoff in sce narios that involved a reduction in the target range for the federal funds rate in reviewing money market developments the deputy manager noted that federal funds continued to trade at rates close to the interest on excess reserves rate more minutes of the meeting of january page over no signs of reserve scarcity were evident in the be havior of the federal funds rate the correlation between daily changes in reserve balances and the federal funds rate remained close to zero in other markets repur chase agreement repo rates spiked at yearend report edly reflecting strong demands for financing from deal ers associated with large treasury auction net settle ments on that day combined with a cutback in the supply of financing available from banks and others managing the size of their balance sheets over yearend for report ing purposes the deputy manager noted that the fed eral reserve bank of new york was planning to release a notice in early february for public comment on plans to include new data on selected deposits in the calcula tion of the overnight bank funding rate obfr in ad dition the staff had begun work aimed at publishing a series of backwardlooking average secured overnight fi nancing rates sofr as a further step to support refer ence rate reform the staff planned to solicit public feedback on this effort later this year and initiate publi cation of these averages by the first half of following the briefing participants raised a number of questions about market reports that the federal re serves balance sheet runoff and associated quantitative tightening had been an important factor contributing to the selloff in equity markets in the closing months of last year while respondents assessed that the reduction of securities held in the soma would put some modest upward pressure on treasury yields and agency mort gagebacked securities mbs yields over time they gen erally placed little weight on balance sheet reduction as a prime factor spurring the deterioration in risk sentiment over that period however some other investors report edly held firmly to the belief that the runoff of the fed eral reserves securities holdings was a factor putting significant downward pressure on risky asset prices and the investment decisions of these investors particularly in thin market conditions around the yearend might have had an outsized effect on market prices for a time participants also discussed the hypothesis that investors may have taken some signal about the future path of the federal funds rate based on perceptions that the federal reserve was unwilling to adjust the pace of balance sheet runoff in light of economic and financial developments by unanimous vote the committee ratified the desks domestic transactions over the intermeeting period there were no intervention operations in foreign curren cies for the systems account during the intermeeting pe riod longrun monetary policy implementation frameworks committee participants resumed their discussion from the december meeting of the appropriate longrun framework for monetary policy implementation at the january meeting the staff provided briefings on the ef fectiveness and efficiency of the committees current operating regime and on options for transitioning to the longerrun size of the balance sheet the staff noted that the committee had previously indi cated that in the longer run it intends to operate with no more securities holdings than necessary to implement monetary policy efficiently and effectively in consider ing the effectiveness of the operating regime the staff observed that over recent years the federal reserve had been able to implement monetary policy in an environ ment with ample reserves by adjusting administered ratesincluding the rates on required and excess reserve balances and the offered rate at the overnight reverse re purchase agreement facilitywithout needing to ac tively manage the supply of reserves over this period the effective federal funds rate was generally steady at levels well within the committees target range despite substantial changes in the level of reserves in the banking system and significant changes in money markets regu lations and financial institutions business models in addition other money market rates generally moved closely with the federal funds rate the current regime was therefore effective both in providing control of the policy rate and in ensuring transmission of the policy stance to other rates and broader financial markets the staff briefing also included a discussion of factors relevant in judging the level of reserves that would sup port the efficient implementation of monetary policy the staff suggested that maintaining a buffer of reserves above the minimum quantity that corresponds to the flat portion of the reserve demand curve could reduce the size and frequency of open market operations needed to maintain good control of the policy rate the aggregate level of reserves had already declined by trillion from a peak level of trillion reached in october the decline stemmed from both reductions in asset holdings and increases in nonreserve liabilities such as federal reserve notes in circulation some recent survey information and other evidence suggested that reserves might begin to approach an efficient level later this year against this backdrop the staff presented options for substantially slowing the decline in reserves by ending the reduction in asset holdings at some point over the latter half of this year and thereafter holding the size of the soma portfolio roughly constant for a time so that page federal open market committee the average level of reserves would fall at a very gradual pace reflecting the trend growth in other federal reserve liabilities the staff also described options for communicating plans both for the operating regime and for the comple tion of the normalization of the size of the balance sheet if the committee reached a decision to continue using its current operating regime announcing this decision after the current meeting would help reduce uncertainty about both the longrun implementation framework and the likely evolution of the balance sheet in addition the committee could revise its previous communications to make clear that it was flexible in its approach to normal izing the balance sheet and was prepared to change the details of its balance sheet normalization plans in light of economic and financial developments if necessary to support the fomcs broader policy goals the staff noted that after the end of asset redemptions the desk could reinvest principal payments received from hold ings of agency mbs in treasury securities as directed participants noted some of the key advantages of the federal reserves current operating regime including good control of the policy rate in a variety of conditions and good transmission to other money market rates and broader financial markets they observed that a regime that controlled the policy rate through active manage ment of the supply of reserves likely would have disad vantages in particular the level and variability of re serve demand and supply were likely to be much larger than in the period before the crisis and stabilizing the policy rate in this environment would require large and frequent open market operations participants judged that in light of their extensive previous discussions it was now appropriate to provide the public with more certainty that the federal reserve would continue to use its current operating regime choosing an operating re gime would also allow the committee to move forward on related issues including plans for concluding the nor malization of the size of the balance sheet participants emphasized the importance of describing their chosen operating regime in clear terms to enhance public under standing participants discussed market commentary that sug gested that the process of balance sheet normalization might be influencing financial markets participants noted that the ongoing reduction in the federal re serves asset holdings had proceeded smoothly for more than a year with no significant effects on financial mar kets the gradual reduction in securities holdings had been announced well in advance and as intended was proceeding largely in the background with the federal funds rate remaining the committees primary tool for adjusting the stance of policy nonetheless some inves tors might have interpreted previous communications as indicating that a very high threshold would have to be met before the committee would be willing to adjust its balance sheet normalization plans participants ob served that although the target range for the federal funds rate was the committees primary means of ad justing the stance of policy the balance sheet normaliza tion process should proceed in a way that supports the achievement of the federal reserves dualmandate goals of maximum employment and stable prices con sistent with this principle participants agreed that it was important to be flexible in managing the process of bal ance sheet normalization and that it would be appropri ate to adjust the details of balance sheet normalization plans in light of economic and financial developments if necessary to achieve the committees macroeconomic objectives almost all participants thought that it would be desirable to announce before too long a plan to stop reducing the federal reserves asset holdings later this year such an announcement would provide more certainty about the process for completing the normalization of the size of the federal reserves balance sheet a substantial ma jority expected that when asset redemptions ended the level of reserves would likely be somewhat larger than necessary for efficient and effective implementation of monetary policy if so many suggested that some further very gradual decline in the average level of reserves re flecting the trend growth of other liabilities such as fed eral reserve notes in circulation could be appropriate in these participants view this process would allow the federal reserve to arrive slowly at an efficient level of reserves while maintaining good control of shortterm interest rates without needing to engage in more fre quent open market operations a few participants judged that there would be little benefit to allowing re serves to continue to fall after the end of redemptions or that this approach could have costs such as an undue risk of volatility in shortterm interest rates that would exceed its benefits these participants thought that upon ending asset redemptions the federal reserve should begin adding to its assets to offset growth in non reserve liabilities so as to keep the average level of re serves relatively stable a couple of participants sug gested that a ceiling facility to mitigate temporary unex pected pressures in reserve markets could play a useful role in supporting policy implementation at lower levels of reserves minutes of the meeting of january page participants commented that in light of the committees longstanding plan to hold primarily treasury securities in the long run it would be appropriate once asset re demptions end to reinvest most if not all principal pay ments received from agency mbs in treasury securities some thought that continuing to reinvest agency mbs principal payments in excess of billion per month in agency mbs as under the current balance sheet normal ization plan would simplify communications or provide a helpful backstop against scenarios in which large de clines in longterm interest rates caused agency mbs prepayment speeds to increase sharply however some others judged that retaining the cap on agency mbs re demptions was unnecessary at this stage in the normali zation process these participants noted considerations in support of this view including that principal payments were unlikely to reach the billion level after that the cap could slightly slow the return to a portfolio of primarily treasury securities or that the committee would have the flexibility to adjust the details of its bal ance sheet normalization plans in light of economic and financial developments participants commented that it would be important over time to develop and communi cate plans for reinvesting agency mbs principal pay ments and they expected to continue their discussion of balance sheet normalization and related issues at upcom ing meetings following the discussion the chairman proposed that the committee communicate its intentions regarding monetary policy implementation and its willingness to adjust the details of its balance sheet normalization pro gram by publishing a statement at the conclusion of the meeting all participants agreed with the proposed statement statement regarding monetary policy implementation and balance sheet normalization adopted january after extensive deliberations and thorough re view of experience to date the committee judges that it is appropriate at this time to provide additional infor mation regarding its plans to implement monetary policy the committees policy normalization principles and plans were adopted on september and are available at httpswwwfederalreservegovmonetarypol icyfilesfomcpolicynormalizationpdf on march the committee adopted an addendum to the policy normalization principles and plans which is available at over the longer run additionally the committee is re vising its earlier guidance regarding the conditions under which it could adjust the details of its balance sheet nor malization program accordingly all participants agreed to the following the committee intends to continue to implement monetary policy in a regime in which an ample sup ply of reserves ensures that control over the level of the federal funds rate and other shortterm interest rates is exercised primarily through the setting of the federal reserves administered rates and in which active management of the supply of reserves is not required the committee continues to view changes in the target range for the federal funds rate as its primary means of adjusting the stance of monetary policy the committee is prepared to adjust any of the de tails for completing balance sheet normalization in light of economic and financial developments moreover the committee would be prepared to use its full range of tools including altering the size and composition of its balance sheet if future economic conditions were to warrant a more accommodative monetary policy than can be achieved solely by re ducing the federal funds rate staff review of the economic situation the information available for the january meeting indicated that labor market conditions continued to strengthen and that growth in real gross domestic prod uct gdp was solid in the fourth quarter of last year although the availability of data was more limited than usual because of the partial federal government shut down that extended from december to january consumer price inflation as measured by

multifamily loans and construction loans on balance banks reported tightening their standards for all types of cre loans in the fourth quar ter financing conditions in the residential mortgage market also remained accommodative for most borrowers pur chase mortgage origination activity continued to decline modestly through november while refinancing activity continued to be muted in consumer credit markets financing conditions tight ened a bit but on balance remained generally supportive of growth in household spending banks reported in the sloos that they tightened credit card lending standards during the fourth quarter in the consumer assetbacked securities market spreads widened somewhat amid broad market volatility the staff provided an update on its views with respect to potential risks to financial stability the increase in financial market volatility seen over the fall of last year was characterized as a return to historically more typical levels following the historically lowvolatility environ ment that persisted through much of and however the increase in volatility in financial markets in december was viewed as substantial and as likely exac erbated by thin yearend liquidity among other factors staff judged asset valuation pressures in equity and cor porate debt markets to have abated somewhat in the pe riod since the assessment presented in the november financial stability report staff continued to moni tor developments in the leveraged loan market given the sharp rise in spreads and slowdown in issuance late last year the buildup in overall nonfinancial business debt to levels close to historical highs relative to gdp was viewed as a factor that could amplify adverse shocks to the business sector staff continued to judge risks asso ciated with householdsector debt as moderate both the risks associated with financial leverage and the vul nerabilities related to maturity transformation were viewed as being low as they have been for some time staff economic outlook the us economic forecast prepared by the staff for the january fomc meeting was revised down a little on balance primarily reflecting somewhat lower projected minutes of the meeting of january page paths for domestic equity prices and foreign economic growth the staff estimated that us real gdp growth was solid in the fourth quarter of last year bolstered by consumer spending and business investment and that the effects of the partial federal government shutdown were quite small in that quarter real gdp growth was expected to slow but remain solid in the first half of this year with the effects of the partial federal government shutdown modestly restraining gdp growth in the first quarter and those effects being reversed in the second quarter in the medium term real gdp growth in was forecast to be at a rate above the staffs esti mate of potential output growth step down to the growth rate of potential output next year and then slow further to a pace below potential output growth in the unemployment rate was projected to decline some what further below the staffs estimate of its longerrun natural rate but to bottom out by the end of this year and begin to edge up in with labor market conditions judged to already be tight the staff continued to assume that projected employment gains would manifest in smallerthanusual downward pressure on the unem ployment rate and in largerthanusual upward pressure on the labor force participation rate the staffs forecast for inflation was little revised for the january fomc meeting core pce price inflation was still expected to step up to percent over this year as a whole and then to run at that level through the medium term total pce price inflation was forecast to be a little below core inflation this year and next reflecting pro jected declines in energy prices and then to run at the same level as core inflation in the staff viewed the uncertainty around its projections for real gdp growth the unemployment rate and infla tion as similar to the average of the past years the staff also saw the risks to the forecasts for real gdp growth and the unemployment rate as roughly balanced on the upside household spending and business invest ment could expand faster than the staff projected sup ported in part by the tax cuts enacted last year on the downside trade policies and foreign economic develop ments could move in directions that have significant negative effects on us economic growth risks to the inflation projection also were seen as balanced the up side risk that inflation could increase more than expected in an economy that was projected to move further above its potential was counterbalanced by the downside risk that longerterm inflation expectations may be lower than was assumed in the staff forecast as well as the pos sibility that the dollar could appreciate if foreign eco nomic conditions deteriorated participants views on current conditions and the economic outlook participants agreed that over the intermeeting period the labor market had continued to strengthen and that eco nomic activity had been rising at a solid rate job gains had been strong on average in recent months and the unemployment rate had remained low household spending had continued to grow strongly while growth of business fixed investment had moderated from its rapid pace earlier last year on a month basis both overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy had remained near percent although mar ketbased measures of inflation compensation had moved lower in recent months surveybased measures of longerterm inflation expectations were little changed participants continued to view a sustained expansion of economic activity strong labor market conditions and inflation near the committees symmetric percent ob jective as the most likely outcomes over the next few years participants generally continued to expect the growth rate of real gdp in to step down somewhat from the pace seen over to a rate closer to their estimates of longerrun growth with a few participants commenting that waning fiscal stimulus was expected to contribute to the stepdown several participants com mented that they had nudged down their outlooks for output growth since the december meeting citing a sof tening in consumer or business sentiment a reduction in the outlook for foreign economic growth or the tight ening in financial conditions that had occurred in recent months in their discussion of the household sector participants noted that recent data on spending had been strong sup ported by a strong job market and rising incomes a couple of participants commented that contacts in their districts remained optimistic about consumer spending however some participants noted the recent softening in surveys of consumer sentiment participants ob served that the recent partial federal government shut down had presented a significant hardship for many families a few participants also pointed to continued weakness in the housing sector which was attributed in part to concerns about affordability among potential homebuyers participants noted that growth of business fixed invest ment had moderated from its rapid pace earlier last year some participants highlighted that recent surveys of business sentiment or district contacts had indicated some weakening in optimism or confidence about the economic outlook though available indicators suggested page federal open market committee that the level of business sentiment had remained high concerns about the economic outlook were variously at tributed to uncertainty or worries about slowing global economic growth including in europe and china trade policy waning fiscal policy stimulus and the partial gov ernment shutdown manufacturing contacts in a num ber of districts indicated that such factors were causing them to delay or defer capital expenditures in addition a few participants noted that recent declines in oil or gas oline prices had damped plans for capital expenditures in the energy sector a few participants observed that conditions in the agricultural sector remained difficult citing large inventories of agricultural commodities un certainty about international trade policies and concerns regarding low prices of commodities and farmland however a few participants commented that business optimism had increased among contacts in their dis tricts or that they were planning new capital expendi tures participants observed that both overall inflation and in flation for items other than food and energy remained near percent on a month basis participants con tinued to view inflation near the committees symmetric percent objective as the most likely outcome some participants noted that some factors such as the decline in oil prices slower growth and softer inflation abroad or appreciation of the dollar last year had held down some recent inflation readings and may continue to do so this year in addition many participants commented that upward pressures on inflation appeared to be more muted than they appeared to be last year despite strengthening labor market conditions and rising input costs for some industries in their discussion of indicators of inflation expecta tions participants noted that marketbased measures of inflation compensation had moved lower in recent months participants expressed a range of views in in terpreting the decline in inflation compensation on the one hand that decline could stem from a decrease in ex pected inflation on the part of market participants in that case the current low levels of inflation compensa tion could suggest that inflation expectations are below the committees percent inflation objective on the other hand the decline in inflation compensation might reflect in large part declines in risk premiums or in creased concerns about downside risks to the outlook for inflation this interpretation was seen as consistent with the behavior of the most recent surveybased measures of expected inflation which were little changed in their discussion of labor markets participants agreed that conditions had continued to strengthen estimates of job gains in the december employment report had been strong the unemployment rate had remained low and the labor force participation rate had moved up several participants noted solid rates of hiring or other indicators of tight labor market conditions in their dis tricts some participants commented on recent indica tors at the national or district levels as suggesting a pickup in wage growth the pickup was attributed to tightening in national or district labor market conditions or to gains in the rate of productivity growth continued solid productivity growth was seen as a key factor nec essary to support rising real wages over time participants commented on a number of risks associated with their outlook for economic activity the labor mar ket and inflation over the medium term participants noted that some risks to the downside had increased in cluding the possibilities of a sharperthanexpected slowdown in global economic growth particularly in china and europe a rapid waning of fiscal policy stim ulus or a further tightening of financial market condi tions an increase in some foreign and domestic gov ernment policy uncertainties including those associated with brexit an escalation in international trade policy tensions and the potential for additional extended fed eral government shutdowns were also cited as downside risks a few participants expressed concern that longer run inflation expectations may be lower than levels con sistent with the committees percent inflation objec tive several participants judged that risks that could lead to higherthanexpected inflation had diminished relative to downside risks the potential that various sources of uncertainty might abate more quickly than ex pected was mentioned as a potential upside risk for the economic outlook in their discussion of financial developments partici pants noted that although financial market conditions had not changed much on net over the intermeeting period prices had been volatile and financial conditions were materially tighter than they had been several months ago with lower equity prices and wider corpo rate risk spreads several participants also noted that the slope of the treasury yield curve was unusually flat by historical standards which in the past had often been as sociated with a deterioration in future macroeconomic performance participants noted that financial asset prices appeared to be sensitive to information regarding trade policy tensions domestic fiscal and monetary pol icy and global economic growth prospects a couple of minutes of the meeting of january page participants noted that the rise in credit spreads over re cent months if it were to persist could restrain future economic activity participants agreed that it was im portant to continue to monitor financial market devel opments and assess the implications of these develop ments for the economic outlook among those participants who commented on financial stability a number expressed concerns about the ele vated financial market volatility and the apparent decline in investors willingness to bear risk that occurred to ward the end of last year although these conditions had eased somewhat in recent weeks a couple of participants noted that the strain in financial markets might have per sisted or spread if it had occurred during a period of less favorable macroeconomic conditions a couple of par ticipants highlighted the role that decreased liquidity at the end of the year appeared to play in exacerbating changes in financial market conditions they empha sized the need to monitor financial market structures or practices that may contribute to strained liquidity condi tions a few participants highlighted the importance of ensuring that financial institutions were able to with stand adverse financial market eventsfor instance by maintaining adequate levels of capital in their consideration of monetary policy at this meeting participants judged that information received since de cember indicated that real economic activity had been rising at a solid rate labor market conditions had contin ued to strengthen and inflation had been near the com mittees objective participants generally expected eco nomic activity to continue expanding at a solid pace in the period ahead with strong labor market conditions and inflation near percent at the time of the decem ber meeting the committee had noted that it would continue to monitor global economic and financial de velopments and assess their implications for the eco nomic outlook participants observed that since then the economic outlook had become more uncertain fi nancial market volatility had remained elevated over the intermeeting period and despite some easing since the december fomc meeting overall financial conditions had tightened since september in addition the global economy had continued to record slower growth and consumer and business sentiment had deteriorated the government policy environment including trade negoti ations and the recent partial federal government shut down was also seen as a factor contributing to uncer tainty about the economic outlook based on their current assessments all participants ex pressed the view that it would be appropriate for the committee to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at to percent with regard to the committees postmeeting statement participants sup ported a proposed change in the forward guidance lan guage that would replace the previous guidance referring to some further gradual increases in the target range for the federal funds rate with an indication that in light of global economic and financial developments and muted inflation pressures the committee would be patient as it determines what future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate may be appropri ate participants also supported a proposal to remove from the statement the characterization of risks to the economic outlook as roughly balanced participants pointed to a variety of considerations that supported a patient approach to monetary policy at this juncture as an appropriate step in managing various risks and uncertainties in the outlook with regard to the do mestic economic picture additional data would help pol icymakers gauge the trajectory of business and consumer sentiment whether the recent softness in core and total inflation and inflation compensation would persist and the effect of the tightening of financial conditions on ag gregate demand information arriving in coming months could also shed light on the effects of the recent partial federal government shutdown on the us econ omy and on the results of the budget negotiations occur ring in the wake of the shutdown including the possible implications for the path of fiscal policy a patient ap proach would have the added benefit of giving policy makers an opportunity to judge the response of eco nomic activity and inflation to the recent steps taken to normalize the stance of monetary policy furthermore a patient posture would allow time for a clearer picture of the international trade policy situation and the state of the global economy to emerge and in particular could allow policymakers to reach a firmer judgment about the extent and persistence of the economic slow down in europe and china participants noted that maintaining the current target range for the federal funds rate for a time posed few risks at this point the current level of the federal funds rate was at the lower end of the range of estimates of the neutral policy rate moreover inflation pressures were muted and asset valuations were less stretched than they had been a few months earlier many participants sug gested that it was not yet clear what adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate may be appropri ate later this year several of these participants argued that rate increases might prove necessary only if inflation outcomes were higher than in their baseline outlook page federal open market committee several other participants indicated that if the economy evolved as they expected they would view it as appro priate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate later this year participants observed that a patient posture in these cir cumstances was consistent with their general approach to setting the stance of policy in which they were im portantly guided by the implications of incoming data for the economic outlook some participants noted that while global economic and financial developments had been important factors leading to a patient monetary policy posture those developments mattered because they affected assessments of the policy rate path most consistent with achievement of the committees dual mandate goals of maximum employment and price sta bility many participants observed that if uncertainty abated the committee would need to reassess the char acterization of monetary policy as patient and might then use different statement language a few participants expressed concerns that in the current environment of increased uncertainty the policy rate projections prepared as part of the summary of eco nomic projections sep do not accurately convey the committees policy outlook these participants were concerned that although the individual participants projections for the federal funds rate in the sep reflect their individual views of the appropriate path for the pol icy rate conditional on the evolution of the economic outlook at times the public had misinterpreted the me dian or central tendency of those projections as repre senting the consensus view of the committee or as sug gesting that policy was on a preset course however some other participants noted that the policy rate pro jections in the sep are a valuable component of the overall information provided about the monetary policy outlook committee policy action in their discussion of monetary policy for the period ahead members judged that information received since the committee met in december indicated that the labor market had continued to strengthen and that economic activity had been rising at a solid rate job gains had been strong on average in recent months and the unemploy ment rate had remained low household spending had continued to grow strongly while growth of business fixed investment had moderated from its rapid pace ear lier last year on a month basis both overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy re mained near percent although marketbased measures of inflation compensation had moved lower in recent months surveybased measures of longerterm inflation expectations were little changed in their consideration of the economic outlook mem bers noted that financial conditions had tightened on net since september and that global growth had mod erated members also observed that a number of uncer tainties including those pertaining to the evolution of policies of the us and foreign governments still awaited resolution however members continued to view sustained expansion of economic activity strong labor market conditions and inflation near the commit tees symmetric percent objective as the most likely outcomes for the us economy in the period ahead in light of global economic and financial developments and muted inflation pressures the committee could be pa tient as it determined what future adjustments to the tar get range for the federal funds rate may be appropriate to support these outcomes after assessing current conditions and the outlook for economic activity the labor market and inflation mem bers decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at to percent members agreed that in determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate the com mittee would assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to the committees maximum em ployment and symmetric percent inflation objectives they reiterated that this assessment would take into ac count a wide range of information including measures of labor market conditions indicators of inflation pres sures and inflation expectations and readings on finan cial and international developments more generally members noted that decisions regarding nearterm ad justments of the stance of monetary policy would appro priately remain dependent on the evolution of the out look as informed by incoming data with regard to the postmeeting statement members agreed to change the characterization of recent growth in economic activity from strong to solid consistent with incoming information that suggested that the pace of expansion of the us economy had moderated some what since late last year the description of indicators of inflation expectations was revised to recognize that the downward moves in marketbased measures of in flation compensation that occurred in recent months had been sustained while also noting that surveybased measures of longerterm inflation expectations were lit tle changed members also agreed to several adjust ments in the description of the outlook for the economy minutes of the meeting of january page and monetary policy the statement language was re vised to indicate that the committee continued to view sustained expansion of economic activity strong labor market conditions and inflation near percent as the most likely outcomes members also agreed to add a sentence indicating that in light of global economic and financial developments and muted inflation pressures the committee will be patient as it determines what fu ture adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate may be appropriate to support these outcomes this sentence was intended to convey the committees view that a patient and flexible approach was appropriate at this time as a way to manage risks while assessing in coming information bearing on the economic outlook in light of the range of uncertainties associated with global economic and financial developments the com mittee decided that it was not useful at this time to ex press a judgment about the balance of risks at the conclusion of the discussion the committee voted to authorize and direct the federal reserve bank of new york until instructed otherwise to execute transactions in the soma in accordance with the fol lowing domestic policy directive to be released at pm effective january the federal open market committee directs the desk to under take open market operations as necessary to maintain the federal funds rate in a target range of to percent

at an offering rate of percent in amounts lim ited only by the value of treasury securities held outright in the system open market account that are available for such operations and by a per counterparty limit of billion per day the committee directs the desk to continue rolling over at auction the amount of principal payments from the federal reserves holdings of treasury securities maturing during each cal endar month that exceeds billion and to continue reinvesting in agency mortgage backed securities the amount of principal pay ments from the federal reserves holdings of agency debt and agency mortgagebacked secu rities received during each calendar month that exceeds billion small deviations from these amounts for operational reasons are ac ceptable the committee also directs the desk to engage in dollar roll and coupon swap transactions as necessary to facilitate settlement of the federal reserves agency mortgagebacked securities transactions the vote also encompassed approval of the statement below to be released at pm information received since the federal open market committee met in december indicates that the labor market has continued to

balance sheet normalization committee participants resumed their discussion from the january meeting on options for transitioning to the longerrun size of the balance sheet the staff de scribed options for ending the reduction in the federal reserves securities holdings at the end of september and for potentially reducing the pace of redemp tions of treasury securities before that date reducing the pace of redemptions before ending them would be consistent with most previous changes in the federal reserves balance sheet policy and would support a grad ual transition to the longrun level of reserves it could also reinforce the committees communications indicat ing that the fomc was flexible in its plans for balance sheet normalization and that the process of balance sheet normalization would remain consistent with the at tainment of the federal reserves monetary policy ob jectives however continuing redemptions at the cur rent pace through september might be simpler to com municate and would somewhat shorten the transition to the longrun level of reserves the staff noted that re ducing the pace of redemptions before september would leave reserves and the balance sheet slightly larger than continuing redemptions at the current pace through september however the longerrun level of reserves and size of the balance sheet would ultimately be deter mined by longterm demand for federal reserve liabili ties staff projections of term premiums and macroeco nomic outcomes did not differ substantially across the two options the staff also described a possible interim plan for rein vesting principal payments received from agency debt page federal open market committee and agency mortgagebacked securities mbs after bal ance sheet runoff ends and until the committee decides on the longerrun composition of the system open mar ket account soma portfolio consistent with the committees longstanding aim to hold primarily treas ury securities in the longer run any principal payments on agency debt and agency mbs would generally be re invested in treasury securities in the secondary market these reinvestments would be allocated across sectors of the treasury market roughly in proportion to the ma turity composition of treasury securities outstanding however the plan would maintain the existing bil lion per month cap on mbs redemptions principal pay ments on agency debt and agency mbs above billion per month would continue to be reinvested in agency mbs this cap would limit the pace at which the federal reserves agency mbs holdings could decline if prepay ments accelerated the staff projected that the redemp tion cap on agency debt and agency mbs was unlikely to be reached after the staff noted that once balance sheet runoff ended the average level of reserves would tend to decline grad ually in line with trend growth in the federal reserves nonreserve liabilities until the committee chose to re sume growth of the balance sheet in order to maintain a level of reserves consistent with efficient and effective policy implementation participants judged that ending the runoff of securities holdings at the end of september would reduce uncer tainty about the federal reserves plans for its securities holdings and would be consistent with the committees decision at its january meeting to continue imple menting monetary policy in a regime of ample reserves participants discussed advantages and disadvantages of slowing balance sheet runoff before the september stop ping date a slowing in the pace of redemptions would accord with the committees general practice of adjust ing its holdings of securities smoothly and predictably which might reduce the risk that market volatility would arise in connection with the conclusion of the runoff of securities holdings however these advantages needed to be weighed against the additional complexity of a plan that would end balance sheet runoff in steps rather than all at once participants reiterated their support for the fomcs in tention to return to holding primarily treasury securities in the long run participants judged that adopting an in terim approach for reinvesting agency debt and agency mbs principal payments into treasury securities across a range of maturities was appropriate while the commit tee continued to evaluate potential longrun maturity structures for the federal reserves portfolio of treas ury securities many participants offered preliminary views on advantages and disadvantages of alternative compositions for the soma portfolio participants ex pected to further discuss the longerrun composition of the portfolio at upcoming meetings participants commented on considerations related to al lowing the average level of reserves to decline in line with trend growth in nonreserve liabilities for a time af ter the end of balance sheet runoff several participants preferred to stabilize the average level of reserves by re suming purchases of treasury securities relatively soon after the end of runoff because they saw little benefit to further declines in reserve balances or because they thought the committee should minimize the risk of in terest rate volatility that could occur if the supply of re serves dropped below a point consistent with efficient and effective implementation of policy some others preferred to allow the average level of reserves to con tinue to decline for a longer time after balance sheet run off ends because such declines could allow the commit tee to learn more about underlying reserve demand be cause they judged that such a process was not likely to result in excessive volatility in money market rates or because they judged that moving to lower levels of re serves was more consistent with the committees previ ous communications indicating that it would hold no more securities than necessary for implementing mone tary policy efficiently and effectively participants noted that the eventual resumption of purchases of securities to keep pace with growth in demand for the federal re serves liabilities whenever it occurred would be a nor mal part of operations to maintain the amplereserves monetary policy implementation regime and would not represent a change in the stance of monetary policy some participants suggested that at future meetings the committee should discuss the potential benefits and costs of tools that might reduce reserve demand or sup port interest rate control following the discussion the chair proposed that the committee communicate its intentions regarding bal ance sheet normalization by publishing a statement at the conclusion of the meeting all participants agreed that it was appropriate to issue the proposed statement minutes of the meeting of march page balance sheet normalization principles and plans adopted march in light of its discussions at previous meetings and the progress in normalizing the size of the federal reserves securities holdings and the level of reserves in the bank ing system all participants agreed that it is appropriate at this time for the committee to provide additional infor mation regarding its plans for the size of its securities holdings and the transition to the longerrun operating regime at its january meeting the committee stated that it intends to continue to implement monetary policy in a regime in which an ample supply of reserves ensures that control over the level of the federal funds rate and other shortterm interest rates is exercised primarily through the setting of the federal reserves adminis tered rates and in which active management of the sup ply of reserves is not required the statement regarding monetary policy implementation and balance sheet normalization released in january as well as the princi ples and plans listed below together revise and replace the committees earlier policy normalization principles and plans x to ensure a smooth transition to the longerrun level of reserves consistent with efficient and effec tive policy implementation the committee intends to slow the pace of the decline in reserves over com ing quarters provided that the economy and money market conditions evolve about as expected o the committee intends to slow the reduction of its holdings of treasury securities by reduc ing the cap on monthly redemptions from the current level of billion to billion begin ning in may o the committee intends to conclude the reduc tion of its aggregate securities holdings in the system open market account soma at the end of september o the committee intends to continue to allow its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage backed securities mbs to decline consistent with the aim of holding primarily treasury se curities in the longer run beginning in october principal pay ments received from agency debt and agency mbs will be reinvested in treasury securities subject to a maximum amount of billion per month any principal pay ments in excess of that maximum will con tinue to be reinvested in agency mbs principal payments from agency debt and agency mbs below the billion maxi mum will initially be invested in treasury securities across a range of maturities to roughly match the maturity composition of treasury securities outstanding the com mittee will revisit this reinvestment plan in connection with its deliberations regarding the longerrun composition of the soma portfolio it continues to be the committees view that limited sales of agency mbs might be warranted in the longer run to reduce or eliminate residual holdings the timing and pace of any sales would be communicated to the public well in advance o the average level of reserves after the fomc has concluded the reduction of its aggregate se curities holdings at the end of september will likely still be somewhat above the level of re serves necessary to efficiently and effectively implement monetary policy in that case the committee currently antic ipates that it will likely hold the size of the soma portfolio roughly constant for a time during such a period persistent grad ual increases in currency and other non reserve liabilities would be accompanied by corresponding gradual declines in reserve balances to a level consistent with efficient and effective implementation of monetary policy o when the committee judges that reserve bal ances have declined to this level the soma portfolio will hold no more securities than nec essary for efficient and effective policy imple mentation once that point is reached the committee will begin increasing its securities holdings to keep pace with trend growth of the federal reserves nonreserve liabilities and maintain an appropriate level of reserves in the system developments in financial markets and open market operations the manager of the soma discussed developments in global financial markets over the intermeeting period in page federal open market committee the united states equity indexes moved higher and credit spreads tightened market participants attributed these moves largely to a perceived shift in the fomcs approach to policy following communications stressing that the committee would be patient in assessing the need for future adjustments in the target range for the federal funds rate and would be flexible on balance sheet policy in europe measures announced by the european cen tral bank ecb in march including an extension of for ward guidance on interest rates and the announcement of another round of targeted longterm refinancing op erations were followed by a decline in euroarea equity markets particularly bank stocks as well as declines in euroarea rates market contacts attributed the price re action to a perception that the measures were not as stimulative as might have been expected given down ward revisions in the ecbs growth and inflation fore casts in china authorities moved toward an easier fis cal and monetary stance chinas aggregate credit growth had rebounded slightly in recent months relative to the declining trend observed last year the shanghai com posite index had risen notably since the turn of the year driven in part by fiscal and monetary stimulus measures as well as perceived progress on trade negotiations de velopments around brexit remained a source of market uncertainty consistent with ongoing investor uncer tainty over the outcome risk reversals on the pound dollar currency pair continued to point to higher de mand for protection against pound depreciation relative to the dollar the deputy manager provided an overview of money market developments and policy implementation over the intermeeting period the effective federal funds rate effr continued to be very stable at a level equal to the interest rate on excess reserves rates in overnight se cured markets continued to exhibit some volatility par ticularly on monthend dates market participants at tributed some of the volatility in overnight secured rates to persistently high net dealer inventories of treasury se curities and to treasury issuance coinciding with the monthend statement dates over the upcoming inter meeting period with the combination of changes in the treasurys balances at the federal reserve and additional asset redemptions reserves were expected to decline to a new low of around trillion by early may with some notable fluctuations in reserves on days associated with tax flows the deputy manager also discussed the transition to a longrun regime of ample reserves following the com mittees january announcement that it intends to con tinue to implement monetary policy in such a regime once the size of the federal reserves balance sheet has normalized the open market desk will at some point need to conduct open market operations to maintain a level of reserves in the banking system that the commit tee deems appropriate in doing so the desk will need to assess banks demand for reserves as well as forecast other federal reserve liabilities and plan operations to maintain a supply of reserves sufficient to ensure that control over shortterm interest rates is exercised pri marily through the setting of administered rates the deputy manager described a possible operational ap proach in an amplereserves regime based on establish ing a minimum operating level that would be a lower bound on the daily level of reserves the assessment of the minimum operating level of reserves would be based on a range of information including surveys of banks and market participants data on banks reserve holdings and market monitoring under the proposed approach the desk would plan open market operations to main tain the daily level of reserves above the minimum oper ating level consistent with the committees intention to maintain a regime that does not require active man agement of the supply of reserves the desk could plan these open market operations over a mediumterm hori zon the average level of reserves over the medium term would then be above the minimum operating level providing a buffer of reserves to absorb daily changes in nonreserve liabilities following the manager and deputy managers report some participants commented on various aspects of the minimum operating level approach decisions regarding how far to allow reserves to decline would need to bal ance important tradeoffs on the one hand a lower minimum operating level might increase the risk of ex cessive interest rate volatility on the other hand a lower minimum operating level could provide more op portunities to learn about underlying reserve demand or could be viewed as more consistent with moving to the smallest securities holdings necessary for efficient and effective monetary policy implementation however the scope for reducing the level of reserves much further after the end of balance sheet runoff might be fairly lim ited by unanimous vote the committee ratified the desks

intermeet ing period communications by major central banks which were on net more accommodative than ex pected along with optimism regarding trade negotia tions between the united states and china

down a little on balance this revision reflected the effects of weaker thanexpected incoming data on both aggregate domes tic spending and foreign economic growth that were only partially offset by a somewhat higher projected path for domestic equity prices and a lower projected trajec tory for interest rates the staff forecast that us real gdp growth would slow markedly in the first quarter reflecting a softening in growth of both consumer spending and business investment but the staff judged that the firstquarter slowdown would be transitory and that real gdp growth would bounce back solidly in the page federal open market committee second quarter in the mediumterm projection real gdp growth was forecast to run at a rate similar to the staffs estimate of potential output growth in and a somewhat lower trajectory on net for real gdp than in the previous projectionand then slow to a pace below potential output growth in the staff revised up slightly its assumed underlying trend in the labor force participation rate raising the level of poten tial output a bit which contributedalong with the lower projected path for real gdpto an assessment that resource utilization was a little less tight than in the previous forecast the unemployment rate was pro jected to decline a little further below the staffs estimate of its longerrun natural rate but to bottom out by the end of this year and begin to edge up in with labor market conditions judged to still be tight the staff con tinued to assume that projected employment gains would manifest in smallerthanusual downward pres sure on the unemployment rate and in largerthanusual upward pressure on the labor force participation rate the staffs forecast for inflation was revised down slightly for the march fomc meeting reflecting some recent softerthanexpected readings on consumer prices core pce price inflation was expected to remain at percent over this year as a whole and then to edge up to percent for the remainder of the medium term total pce price inflation was forecast to run a bit below core inflation over the next three years reflecting pro jected declines in energy prices the staff viewed the uncertainty around its projections for real gdp growth the unemployment rate and infla tion as generally similar to the average of the past years the staff also saw the risks to the forecasts for real gdp growth and the unemployment rate as roughly balanced on the upside household spending and busi ness investment could expand faster than the staff pro jected supported by the tax cuts enacted at the end of still strong overall labor market conditions and upbeat consumer sentiment in addition financial con ditions might not tighten as much as assumed in the staff forecast on the downside the recent softening in a number of economic indicators could be the harbinger of a substantial deterioration in economic activity moreover trade policies and foreign economic develop ments could move in directions that have significant negative effects on us economic growth risks to the inflation projection also were seen as balanced the up side risk that inflation could increase more than expected in an economy that is still projected to be operating no tably above potential for an extended period was coun terbalanced by the downside risk that longerterm infla tion expectations may be lower than was assumed in the staff forecast as well as the possibility that the dollar could appreciate if foreign economic conditions deterio rated participants views on current conditions and the economic outlook in conjunction with this fomc meeting members of the board of governors and federal reserve bank pres idents submitted their projections of the most likely out comes for real gdp growth the unemployment rate and inflation for each year from through and over the longer run based on their individual assess ments of the appropriate path for the federal funds rate the longerrun projections represented each partici pants assessment of the rate to which each variable would be expected to converge over time under appro priate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy these projections and policy assessments are described in the summary of economic projections sep which is an addendum to these minutes participants agreed that information received since the january meeting indicated that the labor market had re mained strong but that growth of economic activity had slowed from its solid rate in the fourth quarter payroll employment was little changed in february but job gains had been solid on average in recent months and the unemployment rate had remained low recent indi cators pointed to slower growth of household spending and business fixed investment in the first quarter on a month basis overall inflation had declined largely as a result of lower energy prices inflation for items other than food and energy remained near percent on bal ance marketbased measures of inflation compensation had remained low in recent months and surveybased measures of longerterm inflation expectations were lit tle changed participants continued to view a sustained expansion of economic activity strong labor market conditions and inflation near the committees symmetric percent ob jective as the most likely outcomes over the next few years underlying economic fundamentals continued to support sustained expansion and most participants in dicated that they did not expect the recent weakness in spending to persist beyond the first quarter neverthe less participants generally expected the growth rate of real gdp this year to step down from the pace seen over to a rate at or modestly above their estimates of longerrun growth participants cited various factors as minutes of the meeting of march page likely to contribute to the stepdown including slower foreign growth and waning effects of fiscal stimulus a number of participants judged that economic growth in the remaining quarters of and in the subsequent couple of years would likely be a little lower on balance than they had previously forecast reasons cited for these downward revisions included disappointing news on global growth and less of a boost from fiscal policy than had previously been anticipated in their discussion of the household sector participants noted that softness in consumer spending had contrib uted importantly to the projected slowing in economic growth in the current quarter many participants pointed to the weakness in retail sales in december as notable although they recognized that the data for jan uary had shown a partial recovery in retail sales partici pants also observed that much of the recent softness likely reflected temporary factors such as the partial fed eral government shutdown and decembers volatility in financial markets and that consumer sentiment had re covered after these factors had receded consequently many participants expected consumer spending to pro ceed at a stronger pace in coming months supported by favorable underlying factors including a strong labor market solid growth in household incomes improve ments in financial conditions and in households balance sheet positions and upbeat consumer sentiment par ticipants noted however that the continued softness in the housing sector was a concern participants also commented on the apparent slowing of growth in business fixed investment in the first quarter factors cited as consistent with the recent softness in in vestment growth included downward revisions in fore casts of corporate earnings relatively low energy prices that provided less incentive for new drilling and explo ration flattening capital goods orders reports from con tacts of softer export sales and of weaker economic ac tivity abroad elevated levels of uncertainty about gov ernment policies including trade policies and the likely effect of recent financial market volatility on business sentiment however many participants pointed to signs that the weakness in investment would likely abate some contacts in manufacturing and other sectors re ported that business conditions were favorable with strong demand for labor business sentiment had recov ered from its recent decline and recent reductions in mortgage interest rates would provide some support for construction activity agricultural activity remained weak in various areas of the country with the weakness in part reflecting adverse effects of trade policy on com modity prices recent widespread severe flooding had also adversely affected the agricultural sector participants noted that the latest readings on overall in flation had been somewhat softer than expected how ever participants observed that these readings largely re flected the effects of earlier declines in crude oil prices and that core inflation remained near percent most participants while seeing inflation pressures as muted expected the overall rate of inflation to firm somewhat and to be at or near the committees longerrun objec tive of percent over the next few years many partici pants indicated that while inflation had been close to percent last year it was noteworthy that it had not shown greater signs of firming in response to strong la bor market conditions and rising nominal wage growth as well as to the shortterm upward pressure on prices arising from tariff increases low rates of price increases in sectors of the economy that were not cyclically sensi tive were cited by a couple of participants as one reason for the recent easing in inflation a few participants ob served that the pickup in productivity growth last year was a welcome development helping to bolster potential output and damp inflationary pressures in their discussion of indicators of inflation expecta tions participants noted that marketbased measures of inflation compensation had risen modestly over the in termeeting period although they remained low a cou ple of participants stressed that recent readings on sur vey measures of inflation expectations were also still at low levels several participants suggested that longer term inflation expectations could be at levels somewhat below those consistent with the committees percent inflation objective and that this might make it more dif ficult to achieve that objective on a sustained basis in their discussion of the labor market participants cited evidence that conditions remained strong including the very low unemployment rate a further increase in the labor force participation rate a low number of layoffs nearrecord levels of job openings and helpwanted postings and solid job gains on average in recent months participants observed that following strong job gains in january there had been little growth in pay rolls in february although a few participants pointed out that the february reading had likely been affected by ad verse weather conditions a couple of participants noted that over the medium term some easing in pay roll growth was to be expected as economic growth slowed to its longerrun trend rate reports from busi ness contacts predominantly pointed to continued page federal open market committee strong labor demand with firms offering both higher wages and more nonwage benefits to attract workers economywide wage growth was seen as being broadly consistent with recent rates of labor productivity growth and with inflation of percent a few participants cited the combination of muted inflation pressures and ex panding employment as a possible indication that some slack remained in the labor market participants commented on a number of risks associated with their outlook for economic activity a few partici pants noted that there remained a high level of uncer tainty associated with international developments in cluding ongoing trade talks and brexit deliberations al though a couple of participants remarked that the risks of adverse outcomes were somewhat lower than in jan uary other downside risks included the possibility of sizable spillovers from a greaterthanexpected eco nomic slowdown in europe and china persistence of the softness in spending or a sharp falloff in fiscal stim ulus a few participants observed that an economic de terioration in the united states if it occurred might be amplified by significant debt service burdens for many firms participants also mentioned a number of upside risks regarding the outlook for economic activity includ ing outcomes in which various sources of uncertainty were resolved favorably consumer and business senti ment rebounded sharply or the recent strengthening in labor productivity growth signaled a pickup in the un derlying trend upside risks to the outlook for inflation included the possibility that wage pressures could rise unexpectedly and lead to greaterthanexpected price in creases in their discussion of financial developments partici pants observed that a good deal of the tightening over the latter part of last year in financial conditions had since been reversed federal reserve communications since the beginning of this year were seen as an im portant contributor to the recent improvements in fi nancial conditions participants noted that asset valua tions had recovered strongly and also discussed the de cline that had occurred in recent months in yields on longerterm treasury securities several participants ex pressed concern that the yield curve for treasury securi ties was now quite flat and noted that historical evidence suggested that an inverted yield curve could portend economic weakness however their discussion also noted that the unusually low level of term premiums in longerterm interest rates made historical relationships a less reliable basis for assessing the implications of the recent behavior of the yield curve several participants pointed to the increased debt issuance and higher lever age of nonfinancial corporations as a development that warranted continued monitoring in their discussion of monetary policy decisions at the current meeting participants agreed that it would be ap propriate to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate at to percent participants judged that the labor market remained strong but that information received over the intermeeting period in cluding recent readings on household spending and business fixed investment pointed to slower economic growth in the early part of this year than in the fourth quarter of despite these indications of softer first quarter growth participants generally expected eco nomic activity to continue to expand labor markets to remain strong and inflation to remain near percent participants also noted significant uncertainties sur rounding their economic outlooks including those re lated to global economic and financial developments in light of these uncertainties as well as continued evidence of muted inflation pressures participants generally agreed that a patient approach to determining future ad justments to the target range for the federal funds rate remained appropriate several participants observed that the characterization of the committees approach to monetary policy as patient would need to be reviewed regularly as the economic outlook and uncertainties sur rounding the outlook evolve a couple of participants noted that the patient characterization should not be seen as limiting the committees options for making pol icy adjustments when they are deemed appropriate with regard to the outlook for monetary policy beyond this meeting a majority of participants expected that the evolution of the economic outlook and risks to the out look would likely warrant leaving the target range un changed for the remainder of the year several of these participants noted that the current target range for the federal funds rate was close to their estimates of its longerrun neutral level and foresaw economic growth continuing near its longerrun trend rate over the fore cast period participants continued to emphasize that their decisions about the appropriate target range for the federal funds rate at coming meetings would depend on their ongoing assessments of the economic outlook as informed by a wide range of data as well as on how the risks to the outlook evolved several participants noted that their views of the appropriate target range for the federal funds rate could shift in either direction based on incoming data and other developments some partici pants indicated that if the economy evolved as they cur rently expected with economic growth above its longer minutes of the meeting of march page run trend rate they would likely judge it appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate modestly later this year several participants expressed concerns that the public had at times misinterpreted the medians of participants assessments of the appropriate level for the federal funds rate presented in the sep as representing the con sensus view of the committee or as suggesting that pol icy was on a preset course such misinterpretations could complicate the committees communications re garding its view of appropriate monetary policy particu larly in circumstances when the future course of policy is unusually uncertain nonetheless several participants noted that the policy rate projections in the sep are a valuable component of the overall information provided about the monetary policy outlook the chair noted that he had asked the subcommittee on communications to consider ways to improve the information contained in the sep and to improve communications regarding the role of the federal funds rate projections in the sep as part of the policy process participants also discussed alternative interpretations of subdued inflation pressures in current economic circum stances and the associated policy implications several participants observed that limited inflationary pressures during a period of historically low unemployment could be a sign that low inflation expectations were exerting downward pressure on inflation relative to the commit tees percent inflation target in addition subdued in flation pressures could indicate a less tight labor market than suggested by common measures of resource utili zation consistent with these observations several par ticipants noted that various indicators of inflation expec tations had remained at the lower end of their historical range and a few participants commented that they had recently revised down their estimates of the longerrun unemployment rate consistent with percent inflation in light of these considerations some participants noted that the appropriate response of the federal funds rate to signs of labor market tightening could be modest pro vided that signs of inflation pressures continued to be limited some participants regarded their judgments that the federal funds rate was likely to remain on a very flat trajectory as reflecting other factors such as low esti mates of the longerrun neutral real interest rate or risk management considerations a few participants ob served that the appropriate path for policy insofar as it implied lower interest rates for longer periods of time could lead to greater financial stability risks however a couple of these participants noted that such financial sta bility risks could be addressed through appropriate use of countercyclical macroprudential policy tools or other supervisory or regulatory tools committee policy action in their discussion of monetary policy for the period ahead members judged that the information received since the committee met in january indicated that the labor market remained strong but that growth of eco nomic activity had slowed from its solid rate in the fourth quarter payroll employment was little changed in february but job gains had been solid on average in recent months and the unemployment rate had re mained low recent indicators pointed to slower growth of household spending and

consideration of the economic outlook mem bers noted that financial conditions had improved since the beginning of year but that some time would be needed to assess whether indications of weak economic growth in the first quarter would persist in subsequent quarters members also noted that inflationary pressures remained muted and that a number of uncertainties bearing on the us and global economic outlook still awaited resolution however members continued to view sustained expansion of economic activity strong labor market conditions and inflation near the commit tees symmetric percent objective as the most likely outcomes for the us economy in the period ahead in light of global economic and financial developments and muted inflation pressures members concurred that the committee could be patient as it determined what future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate may be appropriate to support those outcomes after assessing current conditions and the outlook for economic activity the labor market and inflation mem bers decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at to percent members agreed that in determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate the com mittee would assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to the committees maximum employment and symmetric percent inflation objec tives they reiterated that this assessment would take into account a wide range of information including page federal open market committee measures of labor market conditions indicators of infla tion pressures and inflation expectations and readings on financial and international developments more gen erally members noted that decisions regarding near term adjustments of the stance of monetary policy would appropriately remain dependent on the evolution of the outlook as informed by incoming data with regard to the postmeeting statement members agreed to characterize the labor market as remaining strong while payroll employment had been little changed in february job gains had been solid on aver age in recent months and the unemployment rate had remained low members also agreed to note that growth in economic activity appeared to have slowed from its solid rate in the fourth quarter consistent with recent indicators of household spending and business fixed in vestment the description of overall inflation was re vised to recognize that inflation had declined largely as a result of lower energy prices while still noting that in flation for items other than food and energy remained near percent at the conclusion of the discussion the committee voted to authorize and direct the federal reserve bank of new york until instructed otherwise to execute transactions in the soma in accordance with the fol lowing domestic policy directive to be released at pm effective march the federal open market committee directs the desk to under take open

assessments of risks remained roughly balanced in part as a result of their downward revisions to the appropriate federal funds rate path participants assessments of the appropriate future path of the

of the likeliest outcomes for the federal funds rate but rather projections of participants individual assessments of appropriate monetary policy still historical forecast errors provide a broad sense

appropriate to oset the eects of shocks to the economy the condence interval is assumed to be symmetric except when it is truncated at zerothe bottom of the lowest target range for the federal funds rate that has been adopted in the past by the committee this truncation would not be intended to indicate the likelihood of the use of negative interest rates to provide additional monetary policy

condence interval has been truncated at zero summary of economic projections of the meeting of march page forecast uncertainty the economic projections provided by the members of the board of governors and the presidents of the federal reserve banks inform discussions of monetary policy among policymakers and can aid public understanding of the basis for policy actions considerable uncertainty attends these projections however the economic and statistical models and relationships used to help produce economic forecasts are necessarily imperfect descriptions of the real world and the future path of the economy can be affected by myriad unforeseen developments and events thus in setting the stance of monetary policy participants consider not only what appears to be the most likely economic outcome as em bodied in their projections but also the range of alternative possibilities the likelihood of their occurring and the poten tial costs to the economy should they occur table summarizes the average historical accuracy of a range of forecasts including those reported in past monetary policy reports and those prepared by the federal reserve boards staff in advance of meetings of the federal open market committee fomc the projection error ranges shown in the table illustrate the considerable uncertainty as sociated with economic forecasts for example suppose a participant projects that real gross domestic product gdp and total consumer prices will rise steadily at annual rates of respectively percent and percent if the uncertainty at tending those projections is similar to that experienced in the past and the risks around the projections are broadly bal anced the numbers reported in table would imply a prob ability of about percent that actual gdp would expand within a range of to percent in the current year and to percent in the second and third years the corre sponding percent confidence intervals for overall infla tion would be to percent in the current year to percent in the second year and to percent in the third year figures a through c illustrate these confi dence bounds in fan charts that are symmetric and cen tered on the medians of fomc participants projections for gdp growth the unemployment rate and inflation how ever in some instances the risks around the projections may not be symmetric in particular the unemployment rate can not be negative furthermore the risks around a particular projection might be tilted to either the upside or the down side in which case the corresponding fan chart would be asymmetrically positioned around the median projection because current conditions may differ from those that prevailed on average over history participants provide judgments as to whether the uncertainty attached to their projections of each economic variable is greater than smaller than or broadly similar to typical levels of forecast uncer tainty seen in the past years as presented in table and reflected in the widths of the confidence intervals shown in the top panels of figures a through c participants cur rent assessments of the uncertainty surrounding their projec tions are summarized in the bottomleft panels of those fig ures participants also provide judgments as to whether the risks to their projections are weighted to the upside are weighted to the downside or are broadly balanced that is while the symmetric historical fan charts shown in the top panels of figures a through c imply that the risks to par ticipants projections are balanced participants may judge that there is a greater risk that a given variable will be above rather than below their projections these judgments are summa rized in the lowerright panels of figures a through c as with real activity and inflation the outlook for the future path of the federal funds rate is subject to considerable uncertainty this uncertainty arises primarily because each participants assessment of the appropriate stance of mone tary policy depends importantly on the evolution of real ac tivity and inflation over time if economic conditions evolve in an unexpected manner then assessments of the appropri ate setting of the federal funds rate would change from that point forward the final line in table shows the error ranges for forecasts of shortterm interest rates they suggest that the historical confidence intervals associated with projections of the federal funds rate are quite wide it should be noted however that these confidence intervals are not strictly con sistent with the projections for the federal funds rate as these projections are not forecasts of the most likely quarterly out comes but rather are projections of participants individual as sessments of appropriate monetary policy and are on an end ofyear basis however the forecast errors should provide a sense of the uncertainty around the future path of the federal funds rate generated by the uncertainty about the macroeco nomic variables as well as additional adjustments to monetary policy that would be appropriate to offset the effects of shocks to the economy if at some point in the future the confidence interval around the federal funds rate were to extend below zero it would be truncated at zero for purposes of the fan chart shown in figure zero is the bottom of the lowest target range for the federal funds rate that has been adopted by the committee in the past this approach to the construction of the federal funds rate fan chart would be merely a convention it would not have any implications for possible future policy decisions regarding the use of negative interest rates to pro vide additional monetary policy accommodation if doing so were appropriate in such situations the committee could also employ other tools including forward guidance and asset purchases to provide additional accommodation while figures a through c provide information on the uncertainty around the economic projections figure provides information on the range of views across fomc participants a comparison of figure with figures a through c shows that the dispersion of the projections across participants is much smaller than the average forecast errors over the past years page federal open market committee

officer by unanimous vote the committee selected anna paulson to serve as associate economist effective april until the selection of her successor at the first regularly scheduled meeting of the committee in balance sheet normalization participants resumed their discussion of issues related to balance sheet normalization with a focus on the long run maturity composition of the system open market account soma portfolio the staff presented two il lustrative scenarios as a way of highlighting a range of implications of different longrun target portfolio com positions in the first scenario the maturity composition of the us treasury securities in the target portfolio was similar to that of the universe of currently outstanding us treasury securities a proportional portfolio in the second the target portfolio contained only shorter term securities with maturities of three years or less a shorter maturity portfolio the staff provided esti mates of the capacity that the committee would have under each scenario to provide economic stimulus through a maturity extension program mep the staff page federal open market committee also provided estimates of the extent to which term pre miums embedded in longerterm treasury yields might be affected under the two different scenarios based on the staffs standard modeling framework all else equal a move to the illustrative shorter maturity portfolio would put significant upward pressure on term premiums and imply that the path of the federal funds rate would need to be correspondingly lower to achieve the same macro economic outcomes as in the baseline outlook how ever the staff noted the uncertainties inherent in the analysis including the difficulties in estimating the ef fects of changes in soma holdings on longerterm in terest rates and the economy more generally the staff presentation also considered illustrative grad ual and accelerated transition paths to each longrun tar get portfolio under the illustrative gradual transition reinvestments of maturing treasury holdings principal payments on agency mortgagebacked securities mbs and purchases to accommodate growth in federal re serve liabilities would be directed to treasury securities with maturities in the longrun target portfolio under the illustrative accelerated transition the reinvestment of principal payments on agency mbs and purchases to accommodate growth in federal reserve liabilities would be directed to treasury bills until the weighted average maturity wam of the soma portfolio reached the wam associated with the target portfolio depending on the combination of longrun target com position and the transition plan for arriving at that com position the staff reported that in the illustrative sce narios it could take from years to more than years for the wam of the soma portfolio to reach its long run level in its statement regarding monetary policy implemen tation and balance sheet normalization the committee noted that it is prepared to adjust the size and composi tion of the balance sheet to achieve its macroeconomic objectives in a scenario in which the federal funds rate is constrained by the effective lower bound against this backdrop participants discussed the benefits and costs of alternative longrun target portfolio compositions in supporting the use of balance sheet policies in such sce narios in their discussion of a shorter maturity portfolio many participants noted the advantage of increased capacity for the federal reserve to conduct an mep which could be helpful in providing policy accommodation in a fu ture economic downturn given the secular decline in neutral real interest rates and the associated reduced scope for lowering the federal funds rate in response to negative economic shocks several participants viewed an mep as a useful initial option to address a future downturn in which the committee judged that it needed to employ balance sheet actions to provide appropriate policy accommodation participants acknowledged the staff analysis suggesting that creating space to conduct an mep by moving to a shorter maturity portfolio com position could boost term premiums and result in a lower path for the federal funds rate reducing the capac ity to ease financial conditions with adjustments in short term rates a number of participants noted however that the estimates of the effect of a move to a shorter maturity portfolio composition on the longrun neutral federal funds rate are subject to substantial uncertainty and are based on a number of strong modeling assump tions for example estimates of term premium effects based on experience during the crisis could overstate the effects that would be associated with a gradual evolution of the composition of the soma portfolio in addition a shift in the composition of the soma portfolio could result in changes in the supply of securities that would tend to offset upward pressure on term premiums nonetheless other participants expressed concern about the potential that a shorter maturity portfolio composition could result in a lower longrun neutral fed eral funds rate moreover while a shorter maturity port folio would provide substantial capacity to conduct an mep some participants raised questions about the ef fectiveness of meps as a policy tool relative to that of the federal funds rate or other unconventional policy tools these participants noted that in a situation in which it would be appropriate to employ unconven tional policy tools they likely would prefer to employ forward guidance or largescale purchases of assets ahead of an mep in the view of these participants the potential benefit of transitioning to a shorter maturity soma composition in terms of increased ability to con duct an mep might not be worth the potential costs in their discussion of a proportional portfolio composi tion participants observed that moving to this target soma composition would not be expected to have much effect on current staff estimates of term premiums and thus would likely not reduce the scope for lowering the target range for the federal funds rate target in re sponse to adverse economic shocks as a result several participants judged the proportional target composition to be well aligned with the committees previous state ments that changes in the target range for the federal funds rate are the primary means by which the commit tee adjusts the stance of monetary policy in addition several participants noted that while the staff analysis minutes of the meeting of april may page suggested a proportional portfolio would not contain as much capacity to conduct an mep as a shorter maturity portfolio it still would contain meaningful capacity along these lines some participants noted that a pro portional portfolio would also help maintain the tradi tional separation between the federal reserves deci sions regarding the composition of the soma portfolio and the maturity composition of treasury debt held by the private sector however a number of participants judged that it would be desirable to structure the soma portfolio in a way that would provide more capacity to conduct an mep than in the proportional portfolio in addition a couple of participants noted that a shorter maturity portfolio would maintain a narrow gap between the average maturity of the assets in the soma portfolio and the short average maturity of the federal reserves primary liabilities participants also discussed the financial stability implica tions that could be associated with alternative longrun target portfolio compositions a couple of participants noted that a proportional portfolio could imply a rela tively flat yield curve which could result in greater in centives for reach for yield behavior in the financial system that said a few participants noted that a shorter maturity portfolio could affect financial stability risks by increasing the incentives for the private sector to issue shortterm debt a couple of participants judged that financial market functioning might be adversely affected if the holdings in the shorter maturity portfolio ac counted for too large a share of total shorter maturity treasury securities outstanding in discussing the transition to the desired longrun soma portfolio composition several participants noted that a gradual pace of transition could help avoid un wanted effects on financial conditions however par ticipants observed that the gradual transition paths de scribed in the staff presentation would take many years to complete against this backdrop a few participants discussed the possibility of following some type of ac celerated transition perhaps including sales of the somas residual holdings of agency mbs in addition several participants suggested that the committee could communicate its plans about the soma portfolio com position in terms of a desired change over an intermedi ate horizon rather than a specific longrun target several participants expressed the view that a decision regarding the longrun composition of the portfolio would not need to be made for some time and a couple of participants highlighted the importance of making such a decision in the context of the ongoing review of the federal reserves monetary policy strategies tools and communications practices some participants noted the importance of developing an effective communica tion plan to describe the committees decisions regard ing the longrun target composition for the soma port folio and the transition to that target composition developments in financial markets and open mar ket operations the manager of the soma reviewed developments in financial markets over the intermeeting period in the united states prices for equities and other risk assets re portedly were buoyed by perceptions of an accommoda tive stance of monetary policy incoming economic data pointing to continued solid economic expansion and some signs of receding downside risks to the global out look treasury yields declined over the period adding to their substantial drop since september and the expected path of the federal funds rate as implied by futures prices shifted down as well market participants attributed these moves in part to fomc communications indicat ing that the committee would continue to be patient in evaluating the need for any further adjustments of the target range for the federal funds rate softer incoming data on inflation may also have contributed to the down ward revision in the expected path of policy nearly all respondents on the open market desks latest surveys of primary dealers and market participants anticipated that the federal funds target range would be unchanged for the remainder of the year in reviewing global devel opments the manager noted that market prices appeared to reflect perceptions of improved economic prospects in china however investors reportedly remained con cerned about the economic outlook for europe and the united kingdom the manager also reported on developments related to open market operations in light of the declines in inter est rates since november last year principal payments on the federal reserves holdings of agency mbs were projected to exceed the billion redemption cap by a modest amount sometime this summer as directed by the committee any principal payments received on agency mbs in excess of the cap would be reinvested in agency mbs the desk planned to conduct any such operations by purchasing uniform mbs rather than fan nie mae and freddie mac securities consistent with the balance sheet normalization principles and plans re leased following the march meeting reinvestments of maturing treasury securities beginning on may would be based on a cap on monthly treasury redemptions of page federal open market committee billiondown from the billion monthly re demption cap that had been in place since october of last year the deputy manager reviewed developments in domes tic money markets reserve balances declined by billion over the intermeeting period and reached a low point of just below trillion on april the decline in reserves stemmed from a reduction in the somas agency mbs and treasury holdings of bil lion reducing the soma portfolio to trillion and from a shift in the composition of liabilities predomi nantly related to the increase in the treasury general ac count tga the tga was volatile during the intermeeting period in early april the treasury reduced bill issuance and al lowed the tga balance to fall in anticipation of individ ual tax receipts as tax receipts arrived after the tax date the tga rose to more than billion resulting in a sharp decline in reserves over the last two weeks of april against this backdrop the distribution of rates on traded volumes in overnight unsecured markets shifted higher the effective federal funds rate effr moved up to percent by the end of the intermeeting period ba sis points above the interest on excess reserves ioer rate several factors appeared to spur this upward pressure taxrelated runoffs in deposits at banks reportedly led banks to increase shortterm borrowing particularly through federal home loan bank fhlb advances and in the federal funds market although some banks continued to hold large quantities of reserves other banks were operating with reserve balances closer to their lowest comfortable levels as reported in the most recent senior financial officer survey this distribution of reserves may have contributed to somewhat more sus tained upward pressure on the federal funds rate than had been experienced in recent years around taxpay ment dates in addition rates on treasury repurchase agreements repo were in part pushed higher by tax related outflows from governmentonly money market mutual funds and a corresponding decline in repo lend ing by those funds elevated repo rates contributed to upward pressure on the federal funds rate as fhlbs re portedly shifted some of their liquidity investments out of federal funds and into the repo market in addition some market participants pointed to heightened demand for federal funds at month end by some banks in con nection with their efforts to meet liquidity coverage ratio requirements as contributing to upward pressure on the federal funds rate the deputy manager also discussed a staff proposal in which the board would implement a basis point tech nical adjustment to the interest on required reserves iorr and ioer rates the proposed action would bring these rates to basis points below the top of the target range for the federal funds rate and basis points above the bottom of the range and the overnight reverse repurchase agreement on rrp offer rate as with the previous technical adjustments in june and december the proposed adjustment was intended to foster trading in the federal funds market well within the target range established by the fomc a technical adjustment would reduce the spread between the ioer rate and the on rrp offering rate to basis points the smallest since the introduction of the on rrp facility the staff judged that the narrower spread did not pose a significant risk of increased takeup at the on rrp facility because repo rates had been trading well above the on rrp offer rate for some time how ever if it became appropriate in the future to further lower the ioer rate the staff noted that the committee might wish to first consider where to set the on rrp offer rate relative to the target range for the federal funds rate to mitigate this risk the manager concluded the briefing on financial market developments and open market operations with a review of the role of standing swap lines in supporting financial stability he recommended that the committee vote to renew these swap lines at this meeting following the usual annual schedule the committee voted unanimously to renew the recip rocal currency arrangements with the bank of canada and the bank of mexico these arrangements are associ ated with the federal reserves participation in the north american framework agreement of in ad dition the committee voted unanimously to renew the dollar and foreign currency liquidity swap arrangements with the bank of canada the bank of england the bank of japan the european central bank and the swiss na tional bank the votes to renew the federal reserves participation in these standing arrangements occur an nually at the april or may fomc meeting by unanimous vote the committee ratified the desks domestic transactions over the intermeeting period there were no intervention operations in foreign curren cies for the systems account during the intermeeting pe

aircraft production would slow in the sec ond quarter consumer expenditures slowed in the first quarter but monthly data suggested some improvement toward the end of the quarter real pce increased at a robust pace in march after having been unchanged in february per haps partly reflecting a delay in tax refunds from febru ary into march that was due in part to the partial gov ernment shutdown

remained broadly support ive of growth in household spending with all categories of consumer loans recording steady growth in the first quarter according to the april sloos commercial banks left lending standards for auto loans and other consumer loans unchanged in the first quarter how ever credit card interest rates rose and standards report edly tightened for some borrowers the staff provided an update on its assessments of po tential risks to financial stability the staff judged asset valuation pressures in equity and corporate debt markets to have increased significantly this year though not quite to the elevated levels that prevailed for much of last year the staff also reported that in the leveraged loan market risk spreads had narrowed and nonprice terms had loos ened further the buildup in overall nonfinancial busi ness debt to levels close to historical highs relative to gdp was viewed as a factor that could amplify adverse shocks to the business sector and the economy more broadly the staff continued to judge risks associated with householdsector debt as moderate both the risks associated with financial leverage and the vulnerabilities related to maturity transformation were viewed as being low as they have been for some time the staff also noted that the sustained growth of lending by banks to nonbank financial firms represented an increase in finan cial interconnectedness staff economic outlook the projection for us economic activity prepared by the staff for the aprilmay fomc meeting was revised up on net real gdp growth was forecast to slow in the near term from its solid firstquarter pace as sizable con tributions from inventory investment and net exports were not expected to persist the projection for real page federal open market committee gdp growth over the medium term was revised up pri marily reflecting a lower assumed path for interest rates a slightly higher trajectory for equity prices and some what less appreciation of the broad real dollar the staffs lower path for interest rates reflected a methodo logical change in how the staff sets its assumptions about the future path for the federal funds rate in its forecast real gdp was forecast to expand at a rate above the staffs estimate of potential output growth in and and then slow to a pace below potential output growth in the unemployment rate was projected to decline a little further below the staffs estimate of its longerrun natural rate and to bottom out in late with labor market conditions still judged to be tight the staff continued to assume that projected employment gains would manifest in smallerthanusual downward pressure on the unemployment rate and in largerthan usual upward pressure on the labor force participation rate the staffs forecast for inflation was revised down slightly reflecting some recent softerthanexpected readings on consumer price inflation that were not ex pected to persist along with the staffs assessment that the level to which inflation would tend to move in the absence of resource slack or supply shocks was a bit lower in the medium term than previously assumed as a result core pce price inflation was expected to move up in the near term but nevertheless to run just below percent over the medium term total pce price infla tion was forecast to run a bit below core inflation in and reflecting projected declines in energy prices the staff viewed the uncertainty around its projections for real gdp growth the unemployment rate and infla tion as generally similar to the average of the past years the staff also saw the risks to the forecasts for real gdp growth and the unemployment rate as roughly balanced on the upside household spending and busi ness investment could expand faster than the staff pro jected supported by the tax cuts enacted at the end of still strong overall labor market conditions favor able financial conditions and upbeat consumer senti ment on the downside the softening in some eco nomic indicators since late last year could be the leading edge of a significant slowing in the pace of economic growth moreover trade policies and foreign economic developments could move in directions that have signif icant negative effects on us economic growth risks to the inflation projection also were seen as balanced the upside risk that inflation could increase more than expected in an economy that was still projected to be operating notably above potential for an extended pe riod was counterbalanced by the downside risks that re cent soft data on consumer prices could persist and that longerterm inflation expectations may be lower than was assumed in the staff forecast as well as the possibil ity that the dollar could appreciate if foreign economic conditions deteriorated participants views on current conditions and the economic outlook participants agreed that labor markets had remained strong over the intermeeting period and that economic activity had risen at a solid rate job gains had been solid on average in recent months and the unemployment rate had stayed low participants also observed that growth in household spending and business fixed invest ment had slowed in the first quarter overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy both measured on a month basis had declined and were running below percent on balance marketbased measures of inflation compensation had remained low in recent months and surveybased measures of longer term inflation expectations were little changed participants continued to view sustained expansion of economic activity with strong labor market conditions and inflation near the committees symmetric percent objective as the most likely outcomes participants noted the unexpected strength in firstquarter gdp growth but some observed that the composition of growth with large contributions from inventories and net exports and more modest contributions from con sumption and investment suggested that gdp growth in the near term would likely moderate from its strong pace of last year for this year as a whole a number of participants mentioned that they had marked up their projections for real gdp growth reflecting in part the strong firstquarter reading participants cited continu ing strength in labor market conditions improvements in consumer confidence and in financial conditions or diminished downside risks both domestically and abroad as factors likely to support solid growth over the remainder of the year some participants observed that in part because of the waning impetus from fiscal policy and past removal of monetary policy accommodation they expected real gdp growth to slow over the me dium term moving back toward their estimates of trend output growth in their discussion of the household sector participants discussed recent indicators including retail sales and light motor vehicle sales for march which rose from rel atively weak readings in some previous months taken minutes of the meeting of april may page together these developments suggested that the first quarter softness in household spending was likely to prove temporary with the strong jobs market rising incomes and upbeat consumer sentiment growth in pce in coming months was expected to be solid sev eral participants also noted that while the housing sector had been a drag on gdp growth for some time recent data pointed to some signs of stabilization with mort gage rates at their lowest levels in more than a year a few participants thought that residential construction could begin to make positive contributions to gdp growth in the near term a few others were less optimistic participants noted that growth of business fixed invest ment had moderated in the first quarter relative to the average pace recorded last year and discussed whether this more moderate growth was likely to persist a num ber of participants expressed optimism that there would be continued growth in capital expenditures this year al beit probably at a slower pace than in several par ticipants observed that financial conditions and business sentiment had continued to improve consistent with re ports from business contacts in a number of districts however a few others reported less buoyant business sentiment many participants suggested that their own concerns from earlier in the year about downside risks from slowing global economic growth and the deterio ration in financial conditions or similar concerns ex pressed by their business contacts had abated to some extent however a few participants noted that ongoing challenges in the agricultural sector including those as sociated with trade uncertainty and low prices had been exacerbated by severe flooding in recent weeks participants observed that inflation pressures remained muted and that the most recent data on overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy had come in lower than expected at least part of the recent softness in inflation could be attributed to idiosyncratic factors that seemed likely to have only transitory effects on inflation including unusually sharp declines in the prices of apparel and of portfolio management services some research suggests that idiosyncratic factors that largely affected acylical sectors in the economy had ac counted for a substantial portion of the fluctuations in inflation over the past couple of years consistent with the view that recent lower inflation readings could be temporary a number of participants mentioned the trimmed mean measure of pce price inflation pro duced by the federal reserve bank of dallas which re moves the influence of unusually large changes in the prices of individual items in either direction these par ticipants observed that the trimmed mean measure had been stable at or close to percent over recent months participants continued to view inflation near the com mittees symmetric percent objective as the most likely outcome but in light of recent softer inflation readings some viewed the downside risks to inflation as having increased some participants also expressed concerns that longterm inflation expectations could be below lev els consistent with the committees percent target or at risk of falling below that level participants agreed that labor market conditions re mained strong job gains in the march employment re port were solid the unemployment rate remained low and while the labor force participation rate moved down a touch it remained high relative to estimates of its un derlying demographically driven downward trend con tacts in a number of districts continued to report short ages of qualified workers in some cases inducing busi nesses to find novel ways to attract new workers a few participants commented that labor market conditions in their districts were putting upward pressure on compen sation levels for lowerwage jobs although there were few reports of a broadbased pickup in wage growth several participants noted that business contacts ex pressed optimism that despite tight labor markets they would be able to find workers or would find technolog ical solutions for labor shortage problems participants commented on risks associated with their outlook for economic activity over the medium term some participants viewed risks to the downside for real gdp growth as having decreased partly because pro spects for a sharp slowdown in global economic growth particularly in china and europe had diminished these improvements notwithstanding most participants ob served that downside risks to the outlook for growth re main in discussing developments in financial markets a num ber of participants noted that financial market condi tions had improved following the period of stress ob served over the fourth quarter of last year and that the volatility in prices and financial conditions had subsided these factors were thought to have helped buoy con sumer and business confidence or to have mitigated shortterm downside risks to the real economy more generally the improvement in financial conditions was regarded by many participants as providing support for the outlook for economic growth and employment among those participants who commented on financial stability most highlighted recent developments related to leveraged loans and corporate bonds as well as the page federal open market committee current high level of nonfinancial corporate indebted ness a few participants suggested that heightened lev erage and associated debt burdens could render the busi ness sector more sensitive to economic downturns than would otherwise be the case a couple of participants suggested that increases in bank capital in current cir cumstances with solid economic growth and strong profits could help support financial and macroeconomic stability over the longer run a couple of participants observed that asset valuations in some markets appeared high relative to fundamentals a few participants com mented on the positive role that the boards semiannual financial stability report could play in facilitating public discussion of risks that could be present in some seg ments of the financial system in their discussion of monetary policy participants agreed that it would be appropriate to maintain the cur rent target range for the federal funds rate at to percent participants judged that the labor market remained strong and that information received over the intermeeting period showed that economic activity grew at a solid rate however both overall inflation and in flation for items other than food and energy had de clined and were running below the committees per cent objective a number of participants observed that some of the risks and uncertainties that had surrounded their outlooks earlier in the year had moderated includ ing those related to the global economic outlook brexit and trade negotiations that said these and other sources of uncertainty remained in light of global eco nomic and financial developments as well as muted in flation pressures participants generally agreed that a pa tient approach to determining future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate remained appro priate participants noted that even if global economic and financial conditions continued to improve a patient approach would likely remain warranted especially in an environment of continued moderate economic growth and muted inflation pressures participants discussed the potential policy implications of continued low inflation readings many participants viewed the recent dip in pce inflation as likely to be transitory and participants generally anticipated that a patient approach to policy adjustments was likely to be consistent with sustained expansion of economic activ ity strong labor market conditions and inflation near the committees symmetric percent objective several participants also judged that patience in adjusting policy was consistent with the committees balanced approach to achieving its objectives in current circumstances in which resource utilization appeared to be high while in flation continued to run below the committees sym metric percent objective however a few participants noted that if the economy evolved as they expected the committee would likely need to firm the stance of mon etary policy to sustain the economic expansion and keep inflation at levels consistent with the committees objec tive or that the committee would need to be attentive to the possibility that inflation pressures could build quickly in an environment of tight resource utilization in contrast a few other participants observed that sub dued inflation coupled with real wage gains roughly in line with productivity growth might indicate that re source utilization was not as high as the recent low read ings of the unemployment rate by themselves would sug gest several participants commented that if inflation did not show signs of moving up over coming quarters there was a risk that inflation expectations could become anchored at levels below those consistent with the com mittees symmetric percent objectivea development that could make it more difficult to achieve the percent inflation objective on a sustainable basis over the longer run participants emphasized that their monetary policy decisions would continue to depend on their assess ments of the economic outlook and risks to the outlook as informed by a wide range of data committee policy action in their discussion of monetary policy for the period ahead members judged that the information

that this assessment would take into ac count a wide range of information including measures of labor market conditions indicators of inflation pres sures and inflation expectations and readings on finan cial and international developments more generally members noted that decisions regarding nearterm ad justments of the stance of monetary policy would appro priately remain dependent on the

senior research advisor federal reserve bank of san francisco jim dolmas senior research economist federal reserve bank of dallas standing repurchase facility the staff briefed the committee on the possible role of a standing fixedrate repurchase agreement repo facility as part of the monetary policy implementation frame work a facility of this type would allow counterparties to obtain temporary liquidity at a fixed rate of interest through repurchase transactions with the federal re serve involving their holdings of select securities eligible for open market operations the staff presentation noted how such a facility could provide a backstop against unusual spikes in the federal funds rate and other money market rates and might also provide incentives for banks to shift the composition of their portfolios of liquid assets away from reserves and toward highquality securities key design features for such a facility includ ing the fixed rate offered to counterparties the set of eligible counterparties and the range of securities eligi ble to be placed at the facility would influence the effec tiveness of a facility in achieving either of these objec tives the staff noted a number of considerations that could arise in setting these design parameters including potential repercussions in unsecured and secured fund page federal open market committee ing markets the eligibility of counterparties in weak fi nancial condition the potential that turning to such a fa cility could become stigmatized and issues of a level playing field across different classes of counterparties participants commented on a number of issues in con nection with key design parameters for a repo facility in terms of the setting of the facilitys fixed rate many par ticipants acknowledged a tradeoff in determining the level of the rate relative to other money market rates on the one hand establishing the rate at a narrow spread above money market rates would likely provide better interest rate control and could also be helpful in avoiding stigma that can be associated with the use of standing lending facilities with fixed rates set well above the level of money market rates on the other hand setting the rate close to the level of money market rates could result in very sizable federal reserve operations on a daily ba sis that could be viewed as disintermediating the activity of private entities in money markets in considering the eligible set of counterparties for a repo facility a number of participants noted that making the facility available only to primary dealers would likely imply that the effects of the facility would be most direct on repo markets while the influence on the federal funds market would be only indirect a couple of par ticipants noted that particularly if banks were eligible counterparties it would be important for counterparties of all sizes to have access to funding through the facility on the same terms a few participants noted that a fa cility could enhance financial stability by providing a means by which nonbank counterparties can readily ob tain liquidity against their highquality assets a couple of other participants noted ways that a repo facility could have unintended effects on financial stability for exam ple if reserves help support overall financial stability a facility that significantly reduced the demand for re serves might not be beneficial many participants commented on issues associated with the availability of such a facility to firms in different states of financial condition several thought there should not be a guarantee of access to such a facility re gardless of a firms financial condition while a number of others were willing to consider how such a facility could be structured to work effectively in a stressed en vironment where highquality liquid assets were used as collateral a few participants noted that the availability of the facility to banks during periods of stress particu larly when they might be in weak financial condition could be an important factor determining whether a fa cility would significantly reduce banks demand for re serves in normal times in their discussion of key objectives for establishing a repo facility some participants raised questions about whether such a facility is needed in an amplereserves framework noting that the current amplereserves re gime has provided good interest rate control other par ticipants commented on the potential benefits of such a facility as a way to enhance interest rate control in the current implementation regime or as a means to operate in the current implementation framework but with a sig nificantly smaller quantity of reserves than at present a couple of participants noted that a facility could damp volatility in repo rates several participants noted that a facility could possibly aid with multiple policy objectives a number of participants noted that the policy objec tives for a fixedrate standing repo facility would have implications for the appropriate design for the facility several participants recognized the need to carefully evaluate possible parameter settings to guard against un intended consequences including the potential for moral hazard or a more volatile federal reserve balance sheet in addition several participants highlighted the importance of evaluating whether other tools or initia tives could better achieve the desired goals overall no decisions were reached at this meeting participants stated that additional work would be necessary to clearly define the objectives of such a facility and to evaluate its potential net benefits developments in financial markets and open mar ket operations the manager pro tem discussed developments in global financial markets over the intermeeting period trade related developments reportedly led many market partic ipants to take a more pessimistic view of the us eco nomic outlook equity prices and interest rates fell no ticeably after the announcement of higher tariffs on chi nese imports in early may and then again after news that tariffs might be imposed on mexican imports in re sponse to these developments markets appeared to be come more sensitive to incoming news about the out look for global growth and inflation including data that pointed to a continued subdued inflation environment and to slower economic growth in the united states and abroad treasury yields fell sharply and farforward measures of inflation compensation dropped significantly in the united states and abroad against this backdrop mar ket participants reportedly viewed communications by minutes of the meeting of june page federal reserve officials as signaling a greater likelihood of a cut in the target range for the federal funds rate later in the year the expected path of the federal funds rate embedded in futures prices shifted down significantly over the period in the euro area farforward measures of inflation com pensation fell noticeably and market participants report edly increasingly came to believe that further monetary policy accommodation would be needed late in the in termeeting period remarks by european central bank ecb president draghi were interpreted as suggesting increased odds of further asset purchases by the ecb euroarea peripheral spreads to german equivalents moved sharply lower and farforward inflation compen sation recovered modestly the manager pro tem turned next to a review of money market developments and open market desk opera tions money market rates generally stabilized at mod estly lower levels over the intermeeting period likely re flecting both the technical adjustment in the interest on excess reserves ioer rate following the may fomc meeting and a sizable increase in reserve balances asso ciated with a decline in balances held by the treasury in its account at the federal reserve market participants reported seeing slightly more passthrough from repo rates to the federal funds rate on days with heightened firmness in repo rates market participants attributed re cent increases in repo rates on monthend and mid month treasury auction settlement dates in part to ele vated net dealer inventories of treasury securities which dealers finance in the repo market regarding open market operations over the period given the substantial decline in mortgage rates over re cent months and an associated increase in refinancing activity principal payments on the federal reserves holdings of agency mortgagebacked securities mbs had recently moved somewhat above the billion monthly redemption cap as a result the desk began in may to reinvest agency mbs principal payments in ex cess of the cap based on current market rates and pre payment forecasts the desk expected to reinvest mod est amounts of agency mbs over the coming months and possibly again in particularly during the sum mer months by unanimous vote

shifted down markedly based on overnight index swap rates investors expected the federal funds rate to decline about basis points by the end of this yeara downward revision of basis points over the

at a mod erate pace in the first quarter with bank credit data pointing to a pickup in april and may conditions in the consumer assetbacked securities market remained sta ble over the intermeeting period with robust issuance and spreads that were little changed at low levels staff economic outlook the projection for us economic activity prepared by the staff for the june fomc meeting was revised down somewhat on balance real gdp growth was forecast to slow to a moderate rate in the second quarter and move down to a more modest pace in the second half of the year primarily reflecting a more downbeat nearterm outlook for business fixed investment the projection for real gdp growth over the medium term was little changed as the effects of a higher projected path for the broad real dollar and lower trajectory for foreign eco nomic growth were largely counterbalanced by a lower projected path for interest rates real gdp was forecast to expand at a rate a little above the staffs estimate of potential output growth in and and then slow to a pace slightly below potential output growth in the unemployment rate was projected to be roughly flat through and remain below the staffs estimate of its longerrun natural rate with labor market conditions judged to be tight the staff continued to assume that in conjunction with this fomc meeting members of the board of governors and federal reserve bank presidents submitted their projections of the most likely outcomes for real gdp growth the unemployment rate and inflation for each year from through and over the longer run based on their individual assessments of the appropriate path projected employment gains would manifest in smaller thanusual downward pressure on the unemployment rate and in largerthanusual upward pressure on the la bor force participation rate the staffs forecast for inflation was little changed on balance the forecast for total pce price inflation this year was revised down somewhat reflecting a lower nearterm projection for energy prices the core infla tion forecast for this year was unchanged at a level below percent both total and core inflation were projected to move up slightly next year as the low readings early this year were expected to be transitory but nevertheless to continue to run below percent the staff viewed the uncertainty around its projections for real gdp growth the unemployment rate and infla tion as generally similar to the average of the past years although uncertainty was seen to have in creased since the previous forecast moreover the staff also judged that the risks to the forecast for real gdp growth had tilted to the downside with a skew to the upside for the unemployment rate the increased un certainty and shift to downside risks around the projec tion reflected the staffs assessment that international trade tensions and foreign economic developments seemed more likely to move in directions that could have significant negative effects on the us economy than to resolve more favorably than assumed with the risks to the forecast for economic activity tilted to the downside the risks to the inflation projection were also viewed as having a downward skew participants views on current conditions and the economic outlook participants judged that uncertainties and downside risks surrounding the economic outlook had increased signif icantly over recent weeks while they continued to view a sustained expansion of economic activity strong labor market conditions and inflation near the committees symmetric percent objective as the most likely out comes many participants attached significant odds to scenarios with less favorable outcomes moreover nearly all participants in their submissions to the sum mary of economic projections sep had revised down their assessment of the appropriate path of the federal for the federal funds rate the longerrun projections repre sented each participants assessment of the rate to which each variable would be expected to converge over time under ap propriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy these projections and policy assess ments are described in the summary of economic projec tions which is an addendum to these minutes minutes of the meeting of june page funds rate over the projection period that would be con sistent with their modal economic outlook many par ticipants noted that since the committees previous meeting the economy appeared to have lost some mo mentum and pointed to a number of factors supporting that view including recent weak indicators for business confidence business spending and manufacturing activ ity trade developments and signs of slowing global eco nomic growth many participants noted that they viewed the risks to their growth and inflation projec tions such as those emanating from greater uncertainty about trade as shifting notably over recent weeks and that risks were now weighted to the downside participants discussed at some length the softness in var ious indicators of business fixed investment in the sec ond quarter incoming data on shipments and orders of new capital goods looked weak and recent readings from some manufacturing surveys had dropped sharply pri vate sector analysts had marked down their forecasts for longerterm corporate profit growth manufacturing production had posted declines so far this year in addi tion contacts reported that softer export sales weaker economic activity abroad and elevated levels of uncer tainty regarding the global outlook were weighing on business sentiment and leading firms to reassess plans for investment spending several participants noted comments from business contacts reporting that their base case now assumed that uncertainties about the global outlook would remain prominent over the me dium term and would continue to act as a drag on in vestment several participants also noted reports from some business contacts in the manufacturing sector sug gesting that they were putting capital expenditures or hir ing plans on hold and were reevaluating their global sup ply chains in light of trade uncertainties a couple of participants however pointed to signs that investment might pick up including reports from some contacts that their orders and shipments remained strong and that some contacts planned to hire more workers a few par ticipants also noted ongoing challenges in the agricul tural sector including those associated with increased trade uncertainty weak export markets wet weather and severe flooding a few participants remarked on the de cline in energy prices and the associated reduction in ac tivity in the energy sector in their discussion of the household sector participants noted that available data on consumer spending had been solid supported by a strong labor market and rising incomes several participants also noted that measures of consumer sentiment remained upbeat and a couple noted that their business contacts confirmed the view that consumer spending had rebounded from the weak patch earlier in the year several participants however noted that tariffs could eventually become a drag on consumer durables spending especially if additional tar iffs on consumer goods were imposed and that they would be monitoring incoming data for signs of this ef fect a couple of participants noted that the continued softness in the housing sector was a concern even though the decline in mortgage rates since last fall was expected to provide stronger impetus for activity a cou ple of participants were somewhat optimistic that resi dential investment would pick up in their discussion of the labor market participants cited evidence that conditions remained strong including the very low unemployment rate and the fact that job gains had been solid on average in recent months that said job gains in may were weaker than expected and in light of other developments participants judged that it would be important to closely monitor incoming data for any signs of softening in labor market conditions reports from business contacts pointed to continued strong la bor demand with many firms planning to hire more workers economywide wage growth was seen as being broadly consistent with modest average rates of labor productivity growth in recent years however a few par ticipants noted that there were limited signs of upward pressure on wage inflation a few participants cited the combination of muted inflation pressures moderate wage growth and expanding employment as a possible indication that some slack remained in the labor market partly reflecting that combination of developments sev eral participants had revised down their sep estimates of the longerrun normal rate of unemployment participants noted that readings on overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy had come in lower than expected over recent months in light of recent softer inflation readings perceptions of downside risks to growth and global disinflationary pressures many participants viewed the risks to the outlook for in flation as weighted to the downside several participants indicated that while headline inflation had been close to percent last year it was noteworthy that inflation had softened this year despite continued strong labor market conditions participants generally noted that they re vised down their sep projections of inflation for the current year in light of recent data they still anticipated that the overall rate of inflation would firm somewhat and move up to the committees longerrun symmetric objective of percent over the next few years con sistent with that view several participants commented that alternative measures of inflation that removed the page federal open market committee influence of unusually large changes in the prices of in dividual items in either direction were running around percent however a number of participants antici pated that the return to percent would take longer than previously projected even with an assumed path for the federal funds rate that was lower than in their previous projections in their discussion of indicators of inflation expecta tions participants generally observed that marketbased measures of inflation compensation had declined and were at low levels some participants also noted that re cent readings on some survey measures of consumers inflation expectations had declined or stood at histori cally low levels many participants further noted that longerterm inflation expectations could be somewhat below levels consistent with the committees percent inflation objective or that the continued weakness in in flation could prompt expectations to slip further these developments might make it more difficult to achieve their inflation objective on a sustained basis however several participants remarked that inflation expectations appeared to be at levels consistent with the committees percent inflation objective participants generally agreed that downside risks to the outlook for economic activity had risen materially since their may meeting particularly those associated with on going trade negotiations and slowing economic growth abroad other downside risks cited by several partici pants included the possibility that federal budget negoti ations could result in a sharp reduction in government spending or that negotiations to raise the federal debt limit could be prolonged a couple of participants ob served that an economic deterioration in the united states if it occurred might be amplified by significant debt burdens for many firms a few participants re marked that an upside risk to the outlook for economic activity and inflation included a scenario in which trade negotiations were resolved favorably and business senti ment rebounded sharply in their discussion of financial developments partici pants observed that the increase in uncertainty sur rounding the global outlook had affected risk sentiment in financial markets while overall financial conditions remained supportive of growth those conditions ap peared to be premised importantly on expectations that the federal reserve would ease policy in the near term to help offset the drag on economic growth stemming from uncertainties about the global outlook and other downside risks participants also discussed the decline in yields on longerterm treasury securities in recent months many participants noted that the spread be tween the year and month treasury yields was now negative and several noted that their assessment of the risk of a slowing in the economic expansion had in creased based on either the shape of the yield curve or other financial and economic indicators a few partici pants pointed to the growth in debt issuance by nonfi nancial corporations and still generally high asset valua tions as developments that warranted continued moni toring in their discussion of monetary policy decisions at this meeting participants noted that under their baseline outlook the labor market was likely to remain strong with economic activity growing at a moderate pace however they judged that the risks and uncertainties surrounding their outlooks particularly those related to the global economic outlook had intensified in recent weeks moreover inflation continued to run below the committees percent objective similarly inflation for items other than food and energy had remained below percent as well in addition some readings on infla tion expectations had been low the increase in risks and uncertainties surrounding the outlook was quite re cent and nearly all participants agreed that it would be appropriate to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate at to percent at this meeting however they noted that it would be important to mon itor the implications of incoming information and global economic developments for the us economic outlook a couple of participants favored a cut in the target range at this meeting judging that a prolonged period with in flation running below percent warranted a more ac commodative policy response to firmly center inflation and inflation expectations around the committees sym metric percent objective with regard to the outlook for monetary policy beyond this meeting nearly all participants had revised down their assessment of the appropriate path for the federal funds rate over the projection period in their sep sub missions and some had marked down their estimates of the longerrun normal level of the funds rate as well many participants indicated that the case for somewhat more accommodative policy had strengthened partici pants widely noted that the global developments that led to the heightened uncertainties about the economic out look were quite recent many judged additional mone tary policy accommodation would be warranted in the near term should these recent developments prove to be sustained and continue to weigh on the economic out look several others noted that additional monetary pol minutes of the meeting of june page icy accommodation could well be appropriate if incom ing information showed further deterioration in the out look participants stated a variety of reasons that would call for a lower path of the federal funds rate several participants noted that a nearterm cut in the target range for the federal funds rate could help cushion the effects of possible future adverse shocks to the economy and hence was appropriate policy from a riskmanagement perspective some participants also noted that the con tinued shortfall in inflation risked a softening of inflation expectations that could slow the sustained return of in flation to the committees percent objective several participants pointed out that they had revised down their estimates of the longerrun normal rate of unemploy ment and as a result saw a smaller upward contribution to inflation pressures from tight resource utilization than they had earlier a few participants were concerned that inflation expectations had already moved below levels consistent with the committees symmetric percent objective and that it was important to provide additional accommodation in the near term to bolster inflation ex pectations a few participants judged that allowing in flation to run above percent for some time could help strengthen the credibility of the committees commit ment to its symmetric percent inflation objective some participants suggested that although they now judged that the appropriate path of the federal funds rate would follow a flatter trajectory than they had previously assumed there was not yet a strong case for a rate cut from current levels they preferred to gather more in formation on the trajectory of the economy before con cluding that a change in policy stance is warranted a few participants expressed the view that with the econ omy still in a favorable position in terms of the dual mandate an easing of policy in an attempt to increase inflation a few tenths of a percentage point risked over heating the labor markets and fueling financial imbal ances several participants observed that the trimmed mean measure of pce price inflation constructed by the federal reserve bank of dallas had stayed near per cent recently underscoring the view that the recent low readings on inflation will prove transitory committee policy action in their discussion of monetary policy for the period ahead members noted the significant increase in risks and uncertainties attending the economic outlook there were signs of weakness in us business spending and foreign economic data were generally disappointing raising concerns about the strength of global economic growth while strong labor markets and rising incomes continued to support the outlook for consumer spend ing uncertainties and risks regarding the global outlook appeared to be contributing to a deterioration in risk sentiment in financial markets and a decline in business confidence that pointed to a weaker outlook for business investment in the united states inflation pressures re mained muted and some readings on inflation expecta tions were at low levels although nearly all members agreed to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at to percent at this meeting they generally agreed that risks and uncertainties surrounding the eco nomic outlook had intensified and many judged that ad ditional policy accommodation would be warranted if they continued to weigh on the economic outlook one member preferred to lower the target range for the fed eral funds rate by basis points at this meeting stating that the committee should ease policy at this meeting to recenter inflation and inflation expectations at the committees symmetric percent objective members agreed that in determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate the committee would assess realized and ex pected economic conditions relative to the committees maximumemployment and symmetric percent infla tion objectives they reiterated that this assessment would take into account a wide range of information in cluding measures of labor market conditions indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations and readings on financial and international developments more generally members noted that decisions regarding nearterm adjustments of the stance of monetary policy would appropriately remain dependent on the implica tions of incoming information for the economic out look with regard to the postmeeting statement members agreed to several adjustments in the description of the economic situation including a revision in the descrip tion of marketbased measures of inflation compensa tion to recognize the recent fall in inflation compensa tion the committee retained the characterization of the most likely outcomes as sustained expansion of economic activity strong labor market conditions and inflation near the committees symmetric percent ob jective but added a clause to emphasize that uncertain ties about this outlook had increased in describing the monetary policy outlook members agreed to remove the patient language and to emphasize instead that in light of these uncertainties and muted inflation pressures the committee would closely monitor the implications of in coming information for the economic outlook and would act as appropriate to sustain the expansion with page federal open market committee a strong labor market and inflation near its symmetric percent objective at the conclusion of the discussion the committee voted to authorize and direct the federal reserve bank of new york until instructed otherwise to execute transactions in the system open market account in ac cordance with the following domestic policy directive to be released at pm effective june the federal open market committee directs the desk to under take open market operations as necessary to maintain the federal funds rate in

or similar trading conventions at an offering rate of percent in amounts lim ited only by the value of treasury securities held outright in the system open market account that are available for such operations and by a percounterparty limit of billion per day the committee directs the desk to continue rolling over at auction the amount of principal payments from the federal reserves holdings of

george randal k quarles and eric rosengren voting against this action james bullard mr bullard dissented because he believed that the cur rent stance of monetary policy could be better posi tioned to foster progress toward the committees statu tory objectives of maximum employment and stable prices particularly in light of persistent low readings on inflation and from indicators of inflation expectations minutes of the meeting of june page along with the risks to the us outlook associated with global economic developments he noted that a policy rate reduction at the current meeting would help recen ter inflation and inflation expectations at levels con sistent with the committees symmetric percent infla tion objective and simultaneously provide some insur ance against unexpected developments that could slow us economic growth consistent with the committees decision to leave the target range for the federal funds rate unchanged the board of governors voted unanimously to leave

more partici pants than in march saw the risks to the inflation projec tions as weighted to the downside and no participant judged the risks as weighted to the upside in discussing the uncertainty and risks surrounding their economic projections trade developments concerns about global economic growth and weaker business fixed investment were mentioned by participants as sources of uncertainty or downside risk to the us eco nomic growth outlook for the inflation outlook the effect of trade developments was cited as a source of up side risk while the possibility that inflation expectations could be drifting below levels consistent with the fomcs percent inflation objective or the potential for a stronger dollar or weaker domestic demand to put downward pressure on inflation were viewed as down side risks a number of participants mentioned that their assessments of risks remained roughly balanced in part because the downward revisions to their appropri ate path for the federal funds rate were offsetting factors that would otherwise contribute to asymmetric risks participants assessments of the appropriate future path of the federal funds rate are also subject to considerable

of the target range or the target level the condence interval around the median projected values is based on root mean squared errors of various private and government forecasts made over the previous years the condence interval is not strictly consistent with the projections for the federal funds rate primarily because these projections are not forecasts of the likeliest outcomes for the federal

economy the condence interval is assumed to be symmetric except when it is truncated at zerothe bottom of the lowest target range for the federal funds rate that has been adopted in the past by the committee this truncation would not be intended to indicate the likelihood of the use of negative interest rates to provide additional monetary policy accommodation if doing so was judged appropriate

open market committee forecast uncertainty the economic projections provided by the members of the board of governors and the presidents of the federal reserve banks inform discussions of monetary policy among policymakers and can aid public understanding of the basis for policy actions considerable uncertainty attends these projections however the economic and statistical models and relationships used to help produce economic forecasts are necessarily imperfect descriptions of the real world and the future path of the economy can be affected by myriad unforeseen developments and events thus in setting the stance of monetary policy participants consider not only what appears to be the most likely economic outcome as em bodied in their projections but also the range of alternative possibilities the likelihood of their occurring and the poten tial costs to the economy should they occur table summarizes the average historical accuracy of a range of forecasts including those reported in past monetary policy reports and those prepared by the federal reserve boards staff in advance of meetings of the federal open market committee fomc the projection error ranges shown in the table illustrate the considerable uncertainty as sociated with economic forecasts for example suppose a participant projects that real gross domestic product gdp and total consumer prices will rise steadily at annual rates of respectively percent and percent if the uncertainty at tending those projections is similar to that experienced in the past and the risks around the projections are broadly bal anced the numbers reported in table would imply a prob ability of about percent that actual gdp would expand within a range of to percent in the current year to percent in the second year and to percent in the third year the corresponding percent confidence inter vals for overall inflation would be to percent in the current year and to percent in the second and third years figures a through c illustrate these confidence bounds in fan charts that are symmetric and centered on the medians of fomc participants projections for gdp growth the unemployment rate and inflation however in some instances the risks around the projections may not be symmetric in particular the unemployment rate cannot be negative furthermore the risks around a particular projec tion might be tilted to either the upside or the downside in which case the corresponding fan chart would be asymmet rically positioned around the median projection because current conditions may differ from those that prevailed on average over history participants provide judgments as to whether the uncertainty attached to their projections of each economic variable is greater than smaller than or broadly similar to typical levels of forecast uncer tainty seen in the past years as presented in table and reflected in the widths of the confidence intervals shown in the top panels of figures a through c participants cur rent assessments of the uncertainty surrounding their projec tions are summarized in the bottomleft panels of those fig ures participants also provide judgments as to whether the risks to their projections are weighted to the upside are weighted to the downside or are broadly balanced that is while the symmetric historical fan charts shown in the top panels of figures a through c imply that the risks to par ticipants projections are balanced participants may judge that there is a greater risk that a given variable will be above rather than below their projections these judgments are summa rized in the lowerright panels of figures a through c as with real activity and inflation the outlook for the future path of the federal funds rate is subject to considerable uncertainty this uncertainty arises primarily because each participants assessment of the appropriate stance of mone tary policy depends importantly on the evolution of real ac tivity and inflation over time if economic conditions evolve in an unexpected manner then assessments of the appropri ate setting of the federal funds rate would change from that point forward the final line in table shows the error ranges for forecasts of shortterm interest rates they suggest that the historical confidence intervals associated with projections of the federal funds rate are quite wide it should be noted however that these confidence intervals are not strictly con sistent with the projections for the federal funds rate as these projections are not forecasts of the most likely quarterly out comes but rather are projections of participants individual as sessments of appropriate monetary policy and are on an end ofyear basis however the forecast errors should provide a sense of the uncertainty around the future path of the federal funds rate generated by the uncertainty about the macroeco nomic variables as well as additional adjustments to monetary policy that would be appropriate to offset the effects of shocks to the economy if at some point in the future the confidence interval around the federal funds rate were to extend below zero it would be truncated at zero for purposes of the fan chart shown in figure zero is the bottom of the lowest target range for the federal funds rate that has been adopted by the committee in the past this approach to the construction of the federal funds rate fan chart would be merely a convention it would not have any implications for possible future policy decisions regarding the use of negative interest rates to pro vide additional monetary policy accommodation if doing so were appropriate in such situations the committee could also employ other tools including forward guidance and asset purchases to provide additional accommodation while figures a through c provide information on the uncertainty around the economic projections figure provides information on the range of views across fomc participants a comparison of figure with figures a through c shows that the dispersion of the projections across participants is much smaller than the average forecast errors over the past years summary of economic projections

federal reserve bank of san francisco review of monetary policy strategy tools and communication practices committee participants began their discussions related to the ongoing review of the federal reserves monetary policy strategy tools and communication practices staff briefings provided a retrospective on the federal reserves monetary policy actions since the financial cri sis together with background and analysis regarding some key issues in its policy response during the reces sion and the subsequent economic recovery the com mittee lowered the federal funds rate to its effective lower bound elb and provided additional monetary policy accommodation through both forward guidance about the expected path of the policy rate and balance sheet policy these actions eased financial conditions and provided substantial support to economic activity they therefore figured importantly in helping promote the recovery in the labor market and in preventing infla tion from falling substantially below the committees objective the presentation noted however that over the past several years inflation had tended to run mod estly below the committees longerrun goal of per cent while some indicators of longerrun inflation ex pectations currently stood at low levels the staff also provided results from model simulations that illustrated page federal open market committee possible challenges to the achievement of the commit tees dualmandate goals over the medium term these challenges included the proximity of the policy rate to the elb imprecise knowledge about the neutral value of the policy rate and the longerrun normal level of the unemployment rate the diminished response of infla tion to resource utilization and uncertainty about the re lationship between inflation expectations and inflation outcomes in their discussion participants welcomed the review of the monetary policy framework they noted that the in clusion of feedback from the public as part of the review via the fed listens events had improved the transparency of the review process enhanced the federal reserves public accountability and provided insights into the pos itive implications of strong labor markets and high rates of employment for various communities furthermore participants agreed that the review was timely and war ranted in light of the use over the past decade of new policy tools and the emergence of changes in the struc ture and operation of the us economy these changes included the long period during which the federal funds rate was at the elb the probable recurrence of elb episodes if the neutral level of the policy rate remains at historically low levels and the challenges that policymak ers face in influencing inflation and inflation expecta tions when the response of inflation to resource utiliza tion has diminished participants generally agreed that the committees consideration of possible modifications to its policy strategy tools and communication practices would take some time and that the process would be careful deliberate and patient with regard to the current monetary policy framework participants agreed that this framework had served the committee and the us economy well over the past dec ade they judged that forward guidance and balance sheet actions had provided policy accommodation dur ing the elb period and had supported economic activity and a return to strong labor market conditions while also bringing inflation closer to the committees longerrun goal of percent than would otherwise have been the case in addition participants noted that the commit tees balanced approach to promoting its dual mandate of maximum employment and price stability had facili tated committee policy actions aimed at supporting the labor market and economic activity even during times when the provision of accommodation was potentially associated with the risk of inflation running persistently above percent participants further observed that such inflation risksalong with several of the other perceived risks of providing substantial accommodation through nontraditional policy tools including possible adverse implications for financial stabilityhad not been real ized in particular a number of participants commented that as many of the potential costs of the committees asset purchases had failed to materialize the federal re serve might have been able to make use of balance sheet tools even more aggressively over the past decade in providing appropriate levels of accommodation how ever several participants remarked that considerable un certainties remained about the costs and efficacy of asset purchases and a couple of participants suggested that taking account of the uncertainties and the perceived constraints facing policymakers in the years following the recession the committees decisions on the amount of policy accommodation to provide through asset pur chases had been appropriate in their discussion of policy tools participants noted that the experience acquired by the committee with the use of forward guidance and asset purchases has led to an improved understanding of how these tools operate as a result the committee could proceed more confi dently and preemptively in using these tools in the future if economic circumstances warranted participants dis cussed the extent to which forward guidance and balance sheet actions could substitute for reductions in the pol icy rate when the policy rate is constrained by the elb overall participants judged that the federal reserves ability to provide monetary policy accommodation at the elb through the use of forward guidance and balance sheet tools while helpful in mitigating the effects of the constraint on monetary policy arising from the lower bound did not eliminate the risk of protracted periods in which the elb hinders the conduct of policy if pol icymakers are not able to provide sufficient accommo dation at the elb through the use of forward guidance or balance sheet actions the constraints posed by the elb could be an impediment to the attainment of the federal reserves dualmandate objectives over time and put at risk the anchoring of inflation expectations at the committees longerrun inflation objective participants looked forward to a detailed discussion over coming meetings of alternative strategies for monetary policy some participants offered remarks on general features of some of the monetary policy strategies that they would be discussing and on the relationship be tween those strategies and the current framework a few of the options mentioned were makeup strategies in which the realization of inflation below the percent objective would give rise to policy actions designed to deliver inflation above the objective for a time in prin minutes of the meeting of july page ciple such makeup strategies could be designed to pro mote a percent inflation rate on average over some period in such circumstances market expectations that the central bank would seek to make up inflation shortfalls following periods during which the elb was binding could help ease overall financial conditions and thus help support economic activity during elb epi sodes however many participants noted that the ben efits of makeup strategies in supporting economic activ ity and stabilizing inflation depended heavily on the pri vate sectors understanding of those strategies and con fidence that future policymakers would take actions con sistent with those strategies a few participants sug gested that an alternative means of delivering average in flation equal to the committees longerrun objective might involve aiming for inflation somewhat in excess of percent when the policy rate was away from the elb recognizing that inflation would tend to move lower when the policy rate was constrained by the elb another possibility might be for the committee to ex press the inflation goal as a range centered on percent and aim to achieve inflation outcomes in the upper end of the range in periods when resource utilization was high a couple of participants noted that an adoption of a target range would be consistent with the practice of some other central banks a few other participants sug gested that the adoption of a range could convey a mes sage that small deviations of inflation from percent were unlikely to give rise to sizable policy responses a couple of participants expressed concern that if policy makers regularly failed to respond appropriately to per sistent relatively small shortfalls of inflation below the percent longerrun objective inflation expectations and average observed inflation could drift below that ob jective participants also discussed the committees statement on longerrun goals and monetary policy strategy participants noted that this statement had been helpful in articulating and clarifying the federal reserves ap proach to monetary policy the committee first re leased this document in january and had renewed it with a few modifications every year since then on the basis of the monetary policy and economic experi ence of the past decade participants cited a number of topics that they would likely discuss in detail in their de liberations during the review and that might motivate possible modifications to the statement these topics included the conduct of monetary policy in the presence of the elb constraint the role of inflation expectations in monetary policy the best means of conveying the committees balanced approach to monetary policy and the symmetry of its inflation goal the relationship be tween the committees strategy and its decisions about the settings of its policy tools the implications of the low value of the neutral policy rate and of uncertainty about the values of the neutral policy rate and the longerrun normal rate of unemployment the potential benefits and costs of unemployment running below its longerrun normal rate in conditions of muted inflation pressures and the time frame over which policymakers aimed to achieve their dualmandate goals a couple of partici pants emphasized the availability to policymakers of other communication tools through which the commit tee could elaborate on its policy strategy and the chal lenges that monetary policy faced in the current environ ment while also indicating that the committee retains flexibility and optionality to achieve its objectives par ticipants highlighted the importance of the summary of economic projections sep in conveying participants modal outlooks with several participants suggesting that modifications to the seps format might enhance policy communications participants also commented on the importance of considering the connections between monetary policy and financial stability participants expected that at upcoming meetings they would continue their deliberations on the review of the federal reserves monetary policy strategy tools and communication practices these additional discussions would consider various topics such as alternative policy strategies options for enhanced use of existing monetary policy tools possible additions to the policy toolkit po tential changes to communication practices the relation ship between monetary policy and financial stability and the distributional effects of monetary policy developments in financial markets and open mar ket operations the manager pro tem discussed developments in finan cial markets over the intermeeting period regarding market participants views about the july fomc meet ing nearly all respondents from the july open market desk surveys of dealers and market participants ex pected a basis point cut in the target range for the federal funds rate a substantial shift from the june sur veys when a significant majority had a modal forecast for no change survey responses also suggested that expec tations had coalesced around a modal forecast for a total of two basis point cuts in the target range in and no change thereafter through yearend regarding balance sheet policy survey respondents that expected a rate cut at this meeting were almost evenly split on whether the committee would also choose to end bal ance runoff immediately after the meeting or to maintain page federal open market committee the existing plan to halt runoff at the end of september market participants generally judged that a twomonth change in the timing of the end of the balance sheet run off would have only a small effect on the path of the balance sheet and thus very little if any economic effect expectations for nearterm domestic policy easing had occurred against the backdrop of a global shift toward more accommodative monetary policy several central banks had eased policy over the past month and a num ber of others shifted to an easing bias market partici pants were particularly attentive to a statement after the european central banks governing council meeting that was perceived as affirming expectations for further easing and additional asset purchases these changes to the policy outlook in the united states and across a num ber of countries appeared to play an important role in supporting financial conditions and offsetting some of the drag on growth from trade tensions and other risks somewhat reduced concern among market participants about important risks to the global outlook also ap peared to support risk asset prices following the g group of twenty meeting in late june fewer desk contacts and respondents to the desk surveys expected a significant escalation of uschina trade tensions in addition investor sentiment was bolstered by news that the administration and congress had reached a budget and debt ceiling agreement that if passed would remove another source of risk later this year that said contacts recognized that some potentially sizeable downside risks remained many survey respondents still viewed us china trade risks as skewed to the downside and many desk contacts judged that the risks of a nodeal brexit had increased the manager pro tem next discussed developments in money markets and open market operations the spreads of the effective federal funds rate effr and the median eurodollar rate relative to the interest on ex cess reserves ioer rate had increased some and be come more variable over recent months with a notable pickup in daily changes in these spreads since late march moreover the range of rates in unsecured markets each day had widened market participants pointed to pres sures in repurchase agreement repo markets as one fac tor contributing to the uptick in volatility in unsecured rates these pressures in turn seemed to stem partly from elevated dealer inventories of treasury securities and dealers associated financing needs market partici pants also pointed to lower reserve balances as a factor affecting rates in unsecured money market rates over the intermeeting period the level of reserves was little changed on net however some market participants noted the association between the gradual increase in un secured rates relative to the ioer rate over recent months and the declining level of reserves since system open market account soma redemptions began the level of reserves was expected to decline appreciably over coming months partly reflecting an anticipated siz able increase in the treasurys balance at the federal re serve following the agreement on the federal budget and debt ceiling the manager pro tem updated the committee on desk plans to resume cusip committee on uniform secu rities identification procedures aggregation of soma holdings of fannie mae and freddie mac agency mort gagebacked securities mbs to reduce administrative costs and operational complexity and the desk expects to release a statement in august with details on the ag gregation strategy by unanimous vote the committee ratified the desks domestic transactions over the intermeeting period there were no intervention operations in foreign curren cies for the systems account during the intermeeting pe riod staff review of the economic situation the information available for the july meeting in dicated that labor market conditions remained strong and that real gross domestic product gdp increased at a moderate rate in the second quarter consumer price inflation as measured by the month percentage change in the price index for personal consumption ex penditures pce was below percent in june survey based measures of longerrun inflation expectations were little changed total nonfarm payroll employment expanded at a solid rate on average in recent months supported by a brisk gain in june the unemployment rate edged up to percent in june but was still at a historically low level the labor force participation rate also moved up some what but was close to its average over the previous few years and the employmenttopopulation ratio stayed flat the unemployment rates for african americans and asians declined in june the rate for whites was un changed and the rate for hispanics edged up the unem ployment rate for each group was below its level at the end of the previous economic expansion though persis tent differentials between these rates remained the share of workers employed part time for economic rea sons in june continued to be below the lows reached in late the rate of privatesector job openings held steady in may while the rate of quits edged down but minutes of the meeting of july page was still at a high level the fourweek moving average of initial claims for unemployment insurance benefits through midjuly was near historically low levels aver age hourly earnings for all employees rose percent over the months ending in june somewhat faster than a year earlier the employment cost index for pri vatesector workers increased percent over the months ending in june the same as a year earlier data on compensation per hour that reflected the re cent annual update of the national income and product accounts by the bureau of economic analysis bea were not available at the time of the meeting total consumer prices as measured by the pce price index increased percent over the months ending in june this increase was slower than a year earlier as core pce price inflation which excludes changes in consumer food and energy prices moved down to percent consumer food price inflation remained be low core inflation and consumer energy prices declined the average monthly change in the core pce price index during the second quarter was faster than in the first quarter suggesting that some of the soft inflation read ings early in the year were transitory the trimmed mean measure of month pce price inflation constructed by the federal reserve bank of dallas remained at or near percent in recent months the consumer price index cpi rose percent over the months ending in june while core cpi inflation was percent recent surveybased measures of longerrun inflation expecta tions were little changed on balance the preliminary july reading from the university of michigan surveys of consumers moved back up after dipping in june but was still at a relatively low level the measures from the desks survey of primary dealers and survey of market participants were little changed real consumer expenditures rose briskly in the second quarter after a sluggish gain in the first quarter sup ported in part by a robust pace of light motor vehicle sales in may and june however real pce rose more slowly in june than in the first five months of the year suggesting some deceleration in consumer spending go ing into the third quarter key factors that influence consumer spendingincluding a low unemployment rate further gains in real disposable income and ele vated measures of households net worthwere sup portive of solid real pce growth in the near term in addition the preliminary july reading on the michigan survey measure of consumer sentiment remained at an upbeat level real residential investment declined again in the second quarter although starts of new singlefamily homes rose in june the average in the second quarter was lower than in the first quarter starts of multifamily units fell back in june but rose for the second quarter as a whole building permit issuance for new singlefamily homes which tends to be a good indicator of the underlying trend in construction of such homeswas at roughly the same level in june as its firstquarter average on net in may and june sales of new homes declined while sales of existing homes rose real nonresidential private fixed investment edged down in the second quarter as a decline in expenditures on nonresidential structures more than offset an increase in expenditures for business equipment and intellectual property forwardlooking indicators of fixed invest ment were mixed orders for nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft increased in june and some measures of business sentiment improved however analysts ex pectations of firms longerterm profit growth remained soft trade policy concerns appeared to be weighing on investment and the number of crude oil and natural gas rigs in operationan indicator of business spending for structures in the drilling and mining sectorcontinued to decrease in recent weeks industrial production ip was unchanged in june as a decrease in the output of utilities offset increases in the output of manufacturers and mines for the second quarter as a whole both total ip and manufacturing out put declined while mining output rose notably sup ported by a strong gain in crude oil extraction au tomakers assembly schedules suggested that production of light motor vehicles would move up somewhat in the third quarter however new orders indexes from na tional and regional manufacturing surveys pointed to ward continued softness in manufacturing production in coming months total real government purchases rose solidly in the sec ond quarter federal defense spending increased and nondefense purchases returned to more typical levels af ter the partial federal government shutdown in the first quarter real purchases by state and local governments rose moderately boosted by a strong gain in spending on structures and an increase in the payrolls of those governments the nominal us international trade deficit widened in may relative to april as imports increased more than ex ports in june preliminary data indicated declining nominal goods exports and imports within exports de clines were particularly notable for exports of consumer page federal open market committee goods and capital goods the latter of which had already been depressed by the suspension of boeing max exports all told the bea estimates that net exports after adding moderately to firstquarter gdp growth subtracted a similar amount from gdp growth in the second quarter on declining exports and flat imports incoming data suggested that growth in the foreign economies remained subdued in the second quarter in several key advanced foreign economies including the euro area recent indicators pointed to slowing economic growth amid continued weakness in manufacturing and persistent policyrelated uncertainty similarly in china real gdp growth slowed notably in the second quarter after a firstquarter jump in contrast growth in canada and to a lesser extent latin america appeared to pick up from a weak firstquarter pace foreign inflation re mained muted but rose a bit from lows earlier in the year largely reflecting higher energy prices staff review of the financial situation over the intermeeting period financial market develop ments reflected noticeable shifts in expectations for monetary policy in response to federal reserve commu nications economic data releases and trade policy de velopments federal reserve communications were generally regarded as more accommodative than had been anticipated exerting downward pressure on measures of the expected path for the federal funds rate however some betterthanexpected economic data re leases and a slight improvement in the outlook regarding trade partially offset these declines yields on nominal treasury securities were little changed on net equity prices increased corporate bond spreads narrowed and inflation compensation rose modestly financing condi tions for businesses and households were little changed over the intermeeting period and remained generally supportive of spending measures of expectations for nearterm domestic mon etary policy exhibited notable shifts and reversals over the intermeeting period and ended the period little changed on net with market participants still attaching high odds to a basis point reduction in the target range for the federal funds rate at the july fomc meet ing consistent with significant variation in nearterm expectations for monetary policy marketbased indica tors of interest rate uncertainty for shorter maturities over the near term remained somewhat elevated over the intermeeting period marketbased expectations for the

following the june fomc communications the chairs july monetary policy report testimony and announcements regarding trade negotiations following the g meeting addi tionally there was a slight positive reaction to news of an agreement on the federal budget and debt limit eq uity price increases were broad based across major sec tors with technology financial and communication ser vices firms outperforming broad indexes onemonth optionimplied volatility on the sp indexthe vixdecreased slightly on net and corporate credit spreads narrowed conditions in domestic shortterm funding markets re mained fairly stable overnight interest rates in both un secured and secured markets were somewhat elevated over the period in particular repo rates were elevated on and after the june quarterend with the sofr se cured overnight financing rate averaging basis points above the ioer rate over the intermeeting pe riod however the effr remained well within the tar get range averaging basis points above the ioer rate rates on commercial paper and negotiable certificates of deposit declined somewhat accommodative central bank communications both in the united states and abroad and some easing of trade tensions generally supported foreign risky assets over the intermeeting period global equity indexes increased modestly while emerging market sovereign spreads nar rowed on balance the broad dollar index ended the period modestly lower notably the british pound de preciated significantly against the us dollar reportedly as developments led investors to raise the probability they attached to a nodeal brexit minutes of the meeting of july page most sovereign longterm bond yields edged lower on net reflecting firming expectations for further policy ac commodation amid growing concerns about the global economic outlook italian yields declined notably in part as the government passed some fiscal consolidation measures the european central bank left its policy rate unchanged at its july meeting but signaled possible rate cuts at coming meetings and said it will explore options for additional asset purchases several emerging market central banks including south korea turkey and indo nesia lowered policy rates over the period financing conditions for nonfinancial businesses re mained accommodative gross issuance of corporate bonds remained robust in june followed by a typical sea sonal decline in july issuance of institutional leveraged loans increased notably in may but in june it returned to the more moderate pace observed earlier this year respondents to the july senior loan officer opin ion survey on bank lending practices sloos re ported that on net banks continued to ease standards and terms on commercial and industrial loans to large and middlemarket firms in the second quarter with many citing aggressive competition as the reason for do ing so gross equity issuance has been strong in recent months the credit quality of nonfinancial corporations continued to show signs of stabilization in june follow ing some deterioration earlier in the year credit condi tions for both small businesses and municipalities re mained accommodative on balance in the commercial real estate cre sector financing conditions remained generally accommodative despite a modest deceleration in bank loan growth banks in the july sloos reported that standards were about un changed on net in the second quarter for most cre loan categories agency and nonagency commercial mbs issuance was strong in the second quarter as yield spreads ticked down financing conditions in the residential mortgage market remained accommodative over the intermeeting period mortgage rates were little changed since the june fomc meeting but remained about percentage point below their late level these conditions have supported a modest increase in homepurchase origination volume in recent months refinance originations have risen as well but remain near historical lows in consumer credit markets financing conditions were little changed in recent months and remained generally supportive of consumer spending growth in consumer credit in april and may was up a bit from earlier in the year due to a pickup in credit card balances banks in the july sloos continued to report tightened standards for credit cards over the second quarter the staff provided an update on its assessments of po tential risks to financial stability on balance the staff continued to view vulnerabilities as moderate the staff judged asset valuation pressures to be notable in a num ber of markets supported in part by the low level of treasury yields in assessing vulnerabilities stemming from leverage in the household and business sectors the staff noted that business leverage was high while house hold leverage was moderate the staff viewed the buildup in nonfinancial businesssector debt as a factor that could amplify adverse shocks to the business sector and the economy more generally within business debt the staff also reported that in the leveraged loan market the share of new loans to risky borrowers was at a record high and credit extended by private equity firms had continued to grow at the same time financial institu tions were viewed as resilient as the risks associated with financial leverage and funding risk were still viewed as low despite some signs of rising leverage and continued inflows into runprone funds separately the staff noted that market liquidity was overall in good shape al though sudden price drops had become more frequent in some markets staff economic outlook the projection for us economic activity prepared by the staff for the july fomc meeting was revised up somewhat in the near term as an upward revision to households real disposable income in the first half of the year led to a slightly higher secondhalf forecast for consumer spending even so real gdp growth was still forecast to rise more slowly in the second half of the year than in the first half primarily reflecting continued soft business investment and a slower increase in govern ment spending the projection for real gdp growth over the medium term was a little stronger supported by the effects of a higher projected path for equity prices and a lower trajectory for interest rates real gdp was forecast to expand at a rate a little above the staffs esti mate of potential output growth in and and then slow to a pace slightly below potential output growth in the unemployment rate was projected to be roughly flat through and to remain below the staffs estimate of its longerrun natural rate with labor market conditions judged to be tight the staff continued to assume that projected employment gains would man ifest in smallerthanusual downward pressure on the unemployment rate and in largerthanusual upward pressure on the labor force participation rate page federal open market committee the staffs forecast of total pce price inflation this year was revised up a touch reflecting a slightly higher pro jected path for consumer energy prices while the fore cast for core pce price inflation was unrevised at a level below percent both total and core inflation were pro jected to move up slightly next year as the low readings early this year were expected to be transitory but never theless to continue to run below percent the staff continued to view the uncertainty around its projections for real gdp growth the unemployment rate and inflation as generally similar to the average of the past years moreover the staff still judged that the risks to the forecast for real gdp growth were tilted to the downside with a corresponding skew to the up side for the unemployment rate important factors in that assessment were that international trade tensions and foreign economic developments seemed more likely to move in directions that could have significant nega tive effects on the us economy than to resolve more favorably than assumed in addition softness in busi ness investment and manufacturing so far this year was seen as pointing to the possibility of a more substantial slowing in economic growth than the staff projected with the risks to the forecast for economic activity tilted to the downside the risks to the inflation projection were also viewed as having a downward skew participants views on current conditions and the economic outlook participants agreed that the labor market had remained strong over the intermeeting period and that economic activity had risen at a moderate rate job gains had been solid on average in recent months and the unemploy ment rate had remained low although growth of household spending had picked up from earlier in the year growth of business fixed investment had been soft on a month basis overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy were running below percent marketbased measures of inflation compen sation remained low surveybased measures of longer term inflation expectations were little changed participants continued to view a sustained expansion of economic activity strong labor market conditions and inflation near the committees symmetric percent ob jective as the most likely outcomes this outlook was predicated on financial conditions that were more ac commodative than earlier this year more accommoda tive financial conditions in turn partly reflected market reaction to the downward adjustment through the course of the year in the committees assessment of the appropriate path for the target range of the federal funds rate in light of weak global economic growth trade pol icy uncertainty and muted inflation pressures participants generally noted that incoming data over the intermeeting period had been largely positive and that the economy had been resilient in the face of ongoing global developments the economy continued to ex pand at a moderate pace and participants generally ex pected gdp growth to slow a bit to around its estimated potential rate in the second half of the year however participants also observed that global economic growth had been disappointing especially in china and the euro area and that trade policy uncertainty although waning some over the intermeeting period remained elevated and looked likely to persist furthermore inflation pres sures continued to be muted notwithstanding the firm ing in the overall and core pce price indexes in the three months ending in june relative to earlier in the year in their discussion of the business sector participants generally saw uncertainty surrounding trade policy and concerns about global growth as continuing to weigh on business confidence and firms capital expenditure plans participants generally judged that the risks associated with trade uncertainty would remain a persistent head wind for the outlook with a number of participants re porting that their business contacts were making deci sions based on their view that uncertainties around trade were not likely to dissipate anytime soon some partici pants observed that trade uncertainties had receded somewhat especially with the easing of trade tensions with mexico and china several participants noted that over the intermeeting period business sentiment seemed to improve a bit and commented that the data for new capital goods orders had improved some participants expressed the view that the effects of trade uncertainty had so far been modest and referenced reports from business contacts in their districts that investment plans were continuing though with a more cautious posture participants also discussed developments across the manufacturing agriculture and energy sectors of the us economy manufacturing production had declined so far this year dragged down in part by weak real ex ports the ongoing global slowdown and trade uncer tainties several participants noted ongoing challenges in the agricultural sector including those associated with increased trade uncertainty weak export demand and the effects of wet weather and severe flooding a couple of participants commented on the decline in energy prices since last fall and the associated reduction in eco nomic activity in the energy sector minutes of the meeting of july page participants commented on the robust pace of con sumer spending noting the important role that house hold spending was currently playing in supporting the expansion participants judged that household spending would likely continue to be supported by strong labor market conditions rising incomes and upbeat consumer sentiment a few participants noted that the continued softness in residential investment was a concern and that the expected boost to housing activity from the de cline in mortgage rates since last fall had not yet materi alized in contrast a couple of participants reported that some recent indicators of housing activity in their dis tricts had been somewhat more positive of late in their discussion of the labor market participants judged that conditions remained strong with the unem ployment rate near historical lows and continued solid job gains on average in recent months job gains in june were stronger than expected following a weak reading in may looking ahead participants expected the labor market to remain strong with the pace of job gains slower than last year but above what is estimated to be necessary to hold labor utilization steady reports from business contacts pointed to continued strong la bor demand with many firms reporting difficulty finding workers to meet current demand several participants reported seeing notable wage pressures for lowerwage workers however participants viewed overall wage growth as broadly consistent with the modest average rates of labor productivity growth in recent years and consequently as not exerting much upward pressure on inflation several participants remarked that there seemed to be little sign of overheating in labor markets citing the combination of muted inflation pressures and moderate wage growth regarding inflation developments some participants stressed that even with the firming of readings for con sumer prices in recent months both overall and core pce price inflation rates continued to run below the committees symmetric percent objective the latest reading on the month change in the core pce price index was percent furthermore continued weak ness in global economic growth and ongoing trade ten sions had the potential to slow us economic activity and thus further delay a sustained return of inflation to the percent objective many other participants how ever saw the recent inflation data as consistent with the view that the lower readings earlier this year were largely transitory and noted that the trimmed mean measure of pce price inflation constructed by the federal reserve bank of dallas was running around percent a few participants noted differences in the behavior of measures of cyclical and acyclical components of infla tion by some estimates the cyclical component of in flation continued to firm the acyclical component which appeared to be influenced by sectoral and techno logical changes was largely responsible for the low level of inflation and not likely to respond much to monetary policy actions in their discussion of the outlook for inflation partici pants generally anticipated that with appropriate policy inflation would move up to the committees percent objective over the medium term however market based measures of inflation compensation and some sur vey measures of consumers inflation expectations re mained low although they had moved up some of late a few participants remarked that inflation expectations appeared to be reasonably well anchored at levels con sistent with the committees percent inflation objec tive however some participants stressed that the pro longed shortfall in inflation from the longrun goal could cause inflation expectations to drift downa develop ment that might make it more difficult to achieve the committees mandated goals on a sustained basis espe cially in the current environment of global disinflation ary pressures a couple of participants observed that although some indicators of longerterm inflation expec tations like tipsbased inflation compensation and the michigan survey measure had not changed substantially this year on net they were notably lower than their lev els several years ago participants generally judged that downside risks to the outlook for economic activity had diminished somewhat since their june meeting the strong june employment report suggested that the weak may payroll figures were not a precursor to a more material slowdown in job growth the agreement between the united states and china to resume negotiations appeared to ease trade ten sions somewhat in addition many participants noted that the recent agreement on the federal debt ceiling and budget appropriations substantially reduced nearterm fiscal policy uncertainty moreover the possibility of fa vorable outcomes of trade negotiations could be a factor that would provide a boost to economic activity in the future still important downside risks persisted in par ticular participants were mindful that trade tensions were far from settled and that trade uncertainties could intensify again continued weakness in global economic growth remained a significant downside risk and some participants noted that the likelihood of a nodeal brexit had increased page federal open market committee in their discussion of financial market developments participants observed that financial conditions remained supportive of economic growth with borrowing rates low and stock prices near alltime highs participants ob served that current financial conditions appeared to be premised importantly on expectations that the federal reserve would ease policy to help offset the drag on eco nomic growth stemming from the weaker global outlook and uncertainties associated with international trade as well as to provide some insurance to address various downside risks participants also discussed the decline in yields on longerterm nominal treasury securities in recent months a few participants expressed the con cern that the inversion of the treasury yield curve as evidenced by the year yield falling below the month yield had persisted for about two months which could indicate that market participants anticipated weaker eco nomic conditions in the future and that the federal re serve would soon need to lower the federal funds rate substantially in response the longerhorizon real for ward rate implied by tips had also declined suggesting that the longerrun normal level of the real federal funds rate implicit in market prices was lower among those participants who commented on financial stability most highlighted recent credit market develop ments the elevated valuations in some asset markets and the high level of nonfinancial corporate indebted ness several participants noted that high levels of cor porate debt and leveraged lending posed some risks to the outlook a few participants discussed the fast growth of private credit marketsa sector not subject to the same degree of regulatory scrutiny and require ments that applies in the banking sectorand com mented that it was important to monitor this market several participants observed that valuations in equity and corporate bond markets were near alltime highs and that cre valuations were also elevated a couple of par ticipants noted that the low level of treasury yieldsa factor seen as supporting asset prices across a range of marketswas a potential source of risk if yields moved sharply higher however these participants judged that in the near term such risks were small in light of the monetary policy outlooks in the united states and abroad and generally subdued inflation a few partici pants expressed the concern that capital ratios at the largest banks had continued to fall at a time when they should ideally be rising and that capital ratios were ex pected to decline further another view was that finan cial stability risks at present are moderate and that the largest banks would continue to maintain very substan tial capital cushions in light of a range of regulatory re quirements including rigorous stress tests in their discussion of monetary policy decisions at this meeting those participants who favored a reduction in the target range for the federal funds rate pointed to three broad categories of reasons for supporting that ac tion first while the overall outlook remained favorable there had been signs of deceleration in economic ac tivity in recent quarters particularly in business fixed investment and manufacturing a pronounced slowing in economic growth in overseas econo miesperhaps related in part to developments in and uncertainties surrounding international trade appeared to be an important factor in this decelera tion more generally such developments were among those that had led most participants over re cent quarters to revise down their estimates of the policy rate path that would be appropriate to pro mote maximum employment and stable prices second a policy easing at this meeting would be a prudent step from a riskmanagement perspective despite some encouraging signs over the intermeet ing period many of the risks and uncertainties sur rounding the economic outlook that had been a source of concern in june had remained elevated particularly those associated with the global eco nomic outlook and international trade on this point a number of participants observed that policy authorities in many foreign countries had only lim ited policy space to support aggregate demand should the downside risks to global economic growth be realized third there were concerns about the outlook for in flation a number of participants observed that overall inflation had continued to run below the committees percent objective as had inflation for items other than food and energy several of these participants commented that the fact that wage pres sures had remained only moderate despite the low unemployment rate could be a sign that the longer run normal level of the unemployment rate is appre ciably lower than often assumed participants dis cussed indicators for longerterm inflation expecta tions and inflation compensation a number of them concluded that the modest increase in market based measures of inflation compensation over the intermeeting period likely reflected market partici pants expectation of more accommodative mone tary policy in the near future others observed that minutes of the meeting of july page while survey measures of inflation expectations were little changed from june the level of expectations by at least some measures was low most participants judged that longterm inflation expectations either were already below the committees percent goal or could decline below the level consistent with that goal should there be a continuation of the pattern of inflation coming in persistently below percent a couple of participants indicated that they would have preferred a basis point cut in the federal funds rate at this meeting rather than a basis point reduction they favored a stronger action to better address the stub bornly low inflation rates of the past several years rec ognizing that the apparent low sensitivity of inflation to levels of resource utilization meant that a notably stronger real economy might be required to speed the return of inflation to the committees inflation objec tive several participants favored maintaining the same target range at this meeting judging that the real economy con tinued to be in a good place bolstered by confident con sumers a strong job market and a low rate of unemploy ment these participants acknowledged that there were lingering risks and uncertainties about the global econ omy in general and about international trade in particu lar but they viewed those risks as having diminished over the intermeeting period in addition they viewed the news on inflation over the intermeeting period as consistent with their forecasts that inflation would move up to the committees percent objective at an accepta ble pace without an adjustment in policy at this meeting finally a few participants expressed concerns that fur ther monetary accommodation presented a risk to finan cial stability in certain sectors of the economy or that a reduction in the target range for the federal funds rate at this meeting could be misinterpreted as a negative signal about the state of the economy participants also discussed the timing of ending the re duction in the committees aggregate securities holdings in the soma ending the reduction of securities hold ings in august had the advantage of avoiding the appear ance of inconsistency in continuing to allow the balance sheet to run off while simultaneously lowering the target range for the federal funds rate but ending balance sheet reduction earlier than under its previous plan posed some risk of fostering the erroneous impression that the committee viewed the balance sheet as an active tool of policy because the proposed change would end the reduction of its aggregate securities holdings only two months earlier than previously indicated policymak ers concluded that there were only small differences be tween the two options in their implications for the bal ance sheet and thus also in their economic effects in their discussion of the outlook for monetary policy beyond this meeting participants generally favored an approach in which policy would be guided by incoming information and its implications for the economic out look and that avoided any appearance of following a pre set course most participants viewed a proposed quar terpoint policy easing at this meeting as part of a recali bration of the stance of policy or midcycle adjustment in response to the evolution of the economic outlook over recent months a number of participants suggested that the nature of many of the risks they judged to be weighing on the economy and the absence of clarity re garding when those risks might be resolved highlighted the need for policymakers to remain flexible and focused on the implications of incoming data for the outlook committee policy action in their discussion of monetary policy for this meeting members noted that while there had been some im provement in economic conditions over the intermeet ing period and the overall outlook remained favorable significant risks and uncertainties attending the outlook remained in particular sluggish us business fixed in vestment spending and manufacturing output had lin gered suggesting that risks and uncertainties associated with weak global economic growth and in international trade were weighing on the domestic economy strong labor markets and rising incomes continued to support the outlook for consumer spending but modest growth in prices and wages suggested that inflation pressures re mained muted inflation had continued to run below the committees percent symmetric objective market based measures of inflation compensation moved up modestly from the low levels recorded in june but a por tion of this change likely reflected the expectation by market participants of additional nearterm monetary ac commodation surveybased measures of longerterm inflation expectations were little changed on this basis all but two members agreed to lower the target range for the federal funds rate to to percent at this meeting with this adjustment to policy those members who voted for the policy action sought to better position the overall stance of policy to help counter the effects on the outlook of weak global growth and trade policy uncer tainty insure against any further downside risks from those sources and promote a faster return of inflation to the committees symmetric percent objective than page federal open market committee would otherwise be the case those members noted that the action taken at this meeting should be viewed as part of an ongoing reassessment of the appropriate path of the federal funds rate that began in late two mem bers preferred to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate in explaining their policy views those members noted that economic data collected over the intermeeting period had been largely positive and that they anticipated continued strong labor markets and solid growth in activity with inflation gradually moving up to the committees percent target one member also noted that a further easing in policy at a time when the economy is very strong and asset prices are elevated could have adverse implications for financial stability members agreed that in determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate the committee would assess realized and ex pected economic conditions relative to the committees maximumemployment and symmetric percent infla tion objectives they reiterated that this assessment would take into account a wide range of information in cluding measures of labor market conditions indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations and readings on financial and international developments members generally agreed that it was important to main tain optionality in setting the future target range for the federal funds rate and more generally that nearterm ad justments of the stance of monetary policy would appro priately remain dependent on the implications of incom ing information for the economic outlook with regard to the postmeeting statement the commit tee implemented several adjustments in the description of the economic situation including a revision to recog nize that marketbased measures of inflation compensa tion remain low the committee stated that the re duction in the target range for the federal funds rate sup ported its view that sustained expansion of economic activity strong labor market conditions and inflation near the committees symmetric percent objective re mained the most likely outcomes but uncertainties about this outlook remain the phrase as the com mittee contemplates the future path of the target range for the federal funds rate was added to underscore the committees intention to carefully assess incoming in formation before deciding on future policy adjustments the statement noted that the committee would con tinue to monitor the implications of incoming infor mation for the economic outlook and would act as ap propriate to sustain the expansion with a strong labor market and inflation near its symmetric percent objec tive finally the committee announced the conclusion of the reduction of securities holdings in the soma ending the runoff of securities holdings two months earlier than initially planned was seen as having only very small effects on the balance sheet with negligible impli cations for the economic outlook and was helpful in simplifying communications regarding the usage of the committees policy tools at the conclusion of the discussion the committee voted to authorize and direct the federal reserve bank of new york until instructed otherwise to execute transactions in the soma in accordance with the fol lowing domestic policy directive to be released at pm effective august the federal open market committee directs the desk to under take open market operations as necessary to maintain the federal funds rate in a target range of to percent including overnight reverse repurchase operations and reverse repurchase operations with maturities of more than one day when necessary to accommodate weekend hol iday or similar trading conventions at an offer ing rate of percent in amounts limited only by the value of treasury securities held outright in the system open market account that are available for such operations and by a percoun terparty limit of billion per day effective august the committee di rects the desk to roll over at auction all princi pal payments from the federal reserves hold ings of treasury securities and to reinvest all principal payments from the federal reserves holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage backed securities received during each calendar month principal payments from agency debt and agency mortgagebacked securities up to billion per month will be reinvested in treasury securities to roughly match the ma turity composition of treasury securities out standing principal payments in excess of billion per month will continue to be rein vested in agency mortgagebacked securities small deviations from these amounts for oper ational reasons are acceptable the committee also directs the desk to engage in dollar roll and coupon swap transactions as necessary to facilitate settlement of the federal reserves agency mortgagebacked securities transactions minutes of the meeting of july page the vote also encompassed approval of the statement below to be released at pm information received since the federal open market committee met in june indicates that the labor market remains strong and that eco nomic activity has been rising at a moderate rate job gains have been solid on average in recent months and the unemployment rate has remained low although growth of household spending has picked up from earlier in the year growth of business fixed investment has been soft on a month basis overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy are running below percent marketbased measures of inflation compensation remain low surveybased measures of longerterm inflation expectations are little changed consistent with its statutory mandate the com mittee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability in light of the implications of global developments for the economic out look as well as muted inflation pressures the committee decided to lower the target range for the federal funds rate to to percent this action supports the committees view that sus tained expansion of economic activity strong labor market conditions and inflation near the committees symmetric percent objective are the most likely outcomes but uncertainties about this outlook remain as the committee contemplates the future path of the target range for the federal funds rate it will continue to monitor the implications of incoming infor mation for the economic outlook and will act as appropriate to sustain the expansion with a strong labor market and inflation near its sym metric percent objective in determining the timing and size of future ad justments to the target range for the federal funds rate the committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its in taking this action the board approved requests to estab lish that rate submitted by the boards of directors of the fed eral reserve banks of philadelphia chicago st louis dallas and san francisco this vote also encompassed approval by the board of governors of the establishment of a

note subsequently the federal reserve maximum employment objective and its sym metric percent inflation objective this as sessment will take into account a wide range of information including measures

brainard james bullard richard h clarida charles l evans randal k quarles voting against this action esther l george and eric rosengren president george dissented because she believed that an unchanged setting of policy was appropriate based on the incoming data and the outlook for economic activity over the medium term recognizing risks to the outlook from the crosscurrents emanating from trade policy un certainty and weaker global activity president george would be prepared to adjust policy should incoming data point to a materially weaker outlook for the economy president rosengren dissented because he did not see a clear and compelling case for additional accommodation at this time given that the unemployment rate stood near year lows inflation seemed likely to rise toward the committees percent target and financial stability con cerns were elevated as indicated by nearrecord equity prices and corporate leverage consistent with the committees decision to lower the target range for the federal funds rate to to per cent the board of governors voted unanimously to lower the interest rate paid on required and excess re serve balances to percent and voted unanimously to approve a percentage point decrease in the primary credit rate to percent effective august banks of boston new york cleveland richmond atlanta minneapolis and kansas city were informed of the secretary of the boards approval of their establishment of a primary credit rate of percent effective august a sec ond vote of the board encompassed approval of the establish ment of the interest

york review of monetary policy strategy tools and communication practices committee participants continued their discussions re lated to the ongoing review of the federal reserves monetary policy strategy tools and communication practices staff briefings provided an assessment of the risk that the federal funds rate could in some future downturn be constrained by the effective lower bound elb and discussed options for mitigating the costs as sociated with this constraint the staffs analysis sug gested that the elb would likely bind in most future re cessions which could make it more difficult for the fomc to achieve its longerrun objectives of maximum employment and symmetric percent inflation the staff discussed several options for mitigating elb risks including using forward guidance and balance sheet pol icies earlier and more aggressively than in the past attended the discussion of the review of the monetary policy framework through the end of the meeting attended opening remarks for tuesday session only page federal open market committee the staff also illustrated the properties of makeup strategies using model simulations under such strate gies policymakers would promise to make up for past inflation shortfalls with a sustained accommodative stance of policy that is intended to generate higher future inflation these strategies are designed to provide ac commodation at the elb by keeping the policy rate low for an extended period in order to support an economic recovery because of their properties both at and away from the elb makeup strategies may also more firmly anchor inflation expectations at percent than a policy strategy that does not compensate for past inflation misses the staff analysis emphasized however that the benefits of makeup strategies depend importantly on the private sectors understanding of these strategies and their confidence that future policymakers would follow through on promises to keep policy accommodative participants generally agreed with the staffs analysis that the risk of future elb episodes had likely increased over time and that future elb episodes and the reduced ef fect of resource utilization on inflation could inhibit the committees ability to achieve its employment and infla tion objectives the increased elb risk was attributed in part to structural changes in the us economy that had lowered the longerrun real shortterm interest rate and thus the neutral level of the policy rate in this con text a couple of participants noted that uncertainty about the neutral rate made it especially challenging to determine any appropriate changes to the current frame work in light of a low neutral rate and shortfalls of in flation below the percent objective for several years some participants raised the concern that the policy space to reduce the federal funds rate in response to fu ture recessions could be compressed further if inflation shortfalls continued and led to a decline in inflation ex pectations a risk that was also discussed in the staff anal ysis these participants pointed to long ongoing elb spells in other major foreign economies and suggested that to avoid similar circumstances in the united states it was important to be aggressive when confronted with forces holding inflation below objective a couple of participants judged that the lack of monetary policy space abroad and the possibility that fiscal space in the united states might be limited reinforced the case for strengthening the fomcs monetary policy framework as a matter of prudent planning with regard to the current monetary policy framework participants agreed that this framework served the com mittee well in the aftermath of the financial crisis a number of participants noted that the committees ex perience with forward guidance and balance sheet poli cies would likely allow the committee to deploy these tools earlier and more aggressively in the event that they were needed a few indicated that the uncertainty about the effectiveness of these policies was smaller than the uncertainty surrounding the effectiveness of a makeup strategy participants generally agreed that the current framework also served the committee well by providing a strong commitment to achieving the committees maximum employment and symmetric inflation objectives such a commitment was seen as flexible enough to allow the committee to choose policy actions that best support its objectives in a wide array of economic circumstances because of the downside risk to inflation and employ ment associated with the elb most participants were open to the possibility that the dualmandate objectives of maximum employment and stable prices could be best served by strategies that deliver inflation rates that over time are on average equal to the committees longerrun objective of percent promoting such out comes may require aiming for inflation somewhat above percent when the policy rate was away from the elb recognizing that inflation would tend to be lower than percent when the policy rate was constrained by the elb participants suggested several alternatives for do ing so including strategies that make up for past infla tion shortfalls and those that respond more aggressively to belowtarget inflation than to abovetarget inflation in this context several participants suggested that the adoption of a target range for inflation could be helpful in achieving the committees objective of percent in flation on average as it could help communicate to the public that periods in which the committee judged in flation to be moderately away from its percent objec tive were appropriate a couple of participants sug gested analyzing policies in which there was a target range for inflation whose midpoint was modestly higher than percent or in which percent was an inflation floor these policies might enhance policymakers scope to provide accommodation as appropriate when the neutral real interest rate was low although ensuring inflation outcomes averaging per cent over time was seen as important many participants noted that the illustrated makeup strategies delivered only modest benefits in the staffs model simulations these modest benefits in part reflected that the respon siveness of inflation to resource slack had diminished making it more difficult to provide sufficient accommo dation to push inflation back to the committees objec tive in a timely manner some participants suggested minutes of the meeting of september page that the modest effects were particularly pronounced us ing the frbus model and indicated the need for more robustness analysis of simulation results along several di mensions and for further comparison to other alterna tive strategies in addition several participants noted that the implementation of the makeup strategies in the form of either average inflation targeting or pricelevel targeting in the simulations was tied too rigidly to the details of particular rules an advantage of the current framework over such alternative approaches is that it has provided the committee with the flexibility to assess a broad range of factors and information in choosing its policy actions and these actions can vary depending on economic circumstances in order to best achieve the committees dual mandate similarly makeup strategies could be implemented more flexibly in order to deliver more accommodation during a future downturn and through the subsequent recovery than what could be achieved with a mechanical makeup rule participants also discussed a number of challenges asso ciated with makeup strategies many participants ex pressed reservations with the makeup strategies analyzed by the staff some participants raised the concern that the effective use of the makeup strategies in the form of the average inflation targeting and pricelevel targeting rules that the staff presented depended on future policy makers following through on commitments to keep pol icy accommodative for a long time such commitments might be difficult for future policymakers to follow through on especially in situations in which the labor market was strong and inflation was above target a few participants acknowledged that credibly committing to makeup strategies posed challenges however they pointed to the commitments that central banks around the world made to inflation targeting as examples in which similar challenges had been overcome a couple of participants raised the concern that keeping policy rates low for a long time could lead to excessive risk taking in financial markets and threaten financial stabil ity however a couple of other participants judged that macroprudential tools could be used to help ensure that any overleveraging of households and firms did not threaten the financial system while monetary policy needed to be focused on achieving maximum employ ment and symmetric percent inflation a few partici pants viewed the communication challenges associated with averageinflation targeting strategies including the difficulty of conveying the dangers of low inflation to the public as greater than for some other strategies that use thresholdbased forward guidance several partici pants noted that makeup strategies could unduly limit the policy response in situations in which inflation had been running above percent amid signs of an impend ing economic downturn accordingly these participants favored makeup strategies that only reversed past infla tion shortfalls relative to makeup strategies that reversed both past inflation shortfalls and past overruns participants continued to discuss the benefits of the committees review of the monetary policy framework as well as the committees statement on longerrun goals and monetary policy strategy which articulates the committees approach to monetary policy as they did at their meeting in july participants mentioned sev eral issues that this statement might possibly address these issues included the conduct of monetary policy in the presence of the elb constraint the role of inflation expectations in the committees pursuit of its inflation goal the best means of conveying the committees bal anced approach to monetary policy the symmetry of its inflation goal and the time frame over which the com mittee aimed to achieve it participants expected that they would continue their deliberations on these and other topics pertinent to the review at upcoming meet ings they also generally agreed that the committees consideration of possible modifications to its policy strategy tools and communication practices would take some time and that the process would be careful delib erate and patient developments in financial markets and open mar ket operations the manager pro tem first discussed developments in global financial markets over the intermeeting period global financial markets were volatile over the inter meeting period with market participants reacting to in coming information about uschina trade tensions and the global growth outlook in the weeks following the july fomc meeting us yields declined sharply and risk asset prices fell amid a spate of largely negative news about risks to the global economic outlook these price moves reversed to some degree in september as devel opments on trade and economic data turned more posi tive on net treasury yields remained substantially lower while the sp and corporate credit spreads reversed most or all of their earlier losses to end the pe riod little changed even after the partial rebound in september market and surveybased indicators of policy rate expectations suggested that investors viewed it as very likely that the committee would ease policy further at this meeting all respondents from the desks survey of primary dealers and survey of market participants viewed a basis page federal open market committee point decrease in the target range as the most likely out come at this meeting looking beyond september most survey respondents expected another basis point cut by yearend further out while the median of respond ents modal forecasts for the end of pointed to no rate cuts next year individual forecasts were much more dispersed with nearly half of respondents expecting at least one additional basis point cut in and about onefourth expecting two or more cuts market partici pants remained attentive to a range of global risk factors that could affect the policy rate path including trade ten sions between the united states and china develop ments in europe political tensions in hong kong un certainties related to brexit and escalating geopolitical tension in the middle east following attacks on saudi oil facilities the manager pro tem turned next to a discussion of money market conditions money markets were stable over most of the period and the reduction in the interest on excess reserves ioer rate following the july fomc meeting fully passed through to money market rates however money markets became highly volatile just before the september meeting apparently spurred partly by large corporate tax payments and treasury set tlements and remained so through the time of the meet ing in an environment of greater perceived uncertainty about potential outflows related to the corporate tax payment date typical lenders in money markets were less willing to accommodate increased dealer demand for funding moreover some banks maintained reserve lev els significantly above those reported in the senior fi nancial officer survey about their lowest comfortable level of reserves rather than lend in repo markets money market mutual funds reportedly also held back some liquidity in order to cushion against potential out flows rates on overnight treasury repurchase agree ments rose to over percent on september and above percent on september highly elevated repo rates passed through to rates in un secured markets federal home loan banks reportedly scaled back their lending in the federal funds market in order to

saudi oil production and caused an in itial spike in prices on neardated oil futures contracts staff review of the financial situation financial market developments over the intermeeting period were

mained accommodative overall issuance of corporate bonds was solid in august driven by resilient invest mentgrade issuance while speculativegrade corporate bond issuance was somewhat subdued in august it was comparable to that seen over the same period in growth of commercial and industrial loans at banks ticked up driven by faster growth at large domestic banks there were no initial public equity offerings by domestic firms in august amid increased market volatil ity but several deals were expected to be completed in the coming months on balance the credit quality of nonfinancial corporations weakened slightly with the volume of nonfinancial corporate bond downgrades modestly outpacing that of upgrades in recent months credit conditions for both small businesses and munici palities remained accommodative on balance in the commercial real estate cre sector financing conditions remained generally accommodative bank cre loan growth slowed moderately since the second quarter driven by slower growth in loans secured by nonfarm nonresidential properties the volume of agency and nonagency commercial mortgagebacked securities issuance was slightly weaker in july and august than in the same period last year though industry ana lysts reportedly anticipated that issuance would soon pick up in response to recent declines in interest rates financing conditions in the residential mortgage market eased over the intermeeting period residential mort gage rates declined less than longterm treasury yields as the increase in prepayment risk and the rise in implied interest rate volatility reportedly reduced the demand for mortgagebacked securities homepurchase origina tions and refinancing originations both rose financing conditions in consumer credit markets re mained generally supportive of growth in consumer spending although supply conditions continued to be tight for subprime credit card borrowers consumer credit expanded at a moderate pace in the second quarter overall with bank credit data pointing to continued growth through july and august in consumer asset backed securities markets issuance was solid and spreads remained at relatively low levels though some what above their postcrisis averages staff economic outlook the projection for us economic activity prepared by the staff for the september fomc meeting was little changed in the near term real gdp growth was still forecast to be slower in the second half of the year than in the first half mostly attributable to continued soft business investment and a slower increase in govern ment spending the projection for real gdp growth over the medium term was a bit weaker than the previ ous forecast primarily reflecting the effects of a higher projected path for the foreign exchange value of the dol lar and a lower trajectory for economic growth abroad which were partially offset by a lower assumed path for interest rates real gdp was forecast to expand at a rate a little above the staffs estimate of potential output page federal open market committee growth in and and then slow to a pace slightly below potential output growth in and the unemployment rate was projected to be roughly flat through and to remain below the staffs estimate of its longerrun natural rate which was revised down a lit tle in addition the staff revised up its estimate of the level of trend productivity in recent years after incorpo rating the beas recent annual revisions to the national income and product accounts both of these supplyside adjustments led to a somewhat higher projected path for potential output implying that estimates of current and projected resource utilization were less tight than the staff previously assumed the staffs forecast of total pce price inflation for this year was revised down somewhat reflecting slightly lower projected paths for consumer food and energy prices along with a little lower forecast for core pce prices the core pce price inflation forecast for this year was revised down to reflect recent data as well as downwardrevised data for earlier in the year from the beas annual revision both total and core inflation were projected to move up slightly next year as the low readings early this year were expected to be transitory nevertheless both inflation measures were forecast to continue to run below percent through the staff continued to view the uncertainty around its projections for real gdp growth the unemployment rate and inflation as generally similar to the average of the past years moreover the staff still judged that the risks to the forecast for real gdp growth were tilted to the downside with a corresponding skew to the up side for the unemployment rate important factors in that assessment were that international trade tensions and foreign economic developments seemed more likely to move in directions that could have significant nega tive effects on the us economy than to resolve more favorably than assumed in addition softness in busi ness investment and manufacturing so far this year was seen as pointing to the possibility of a more substantial slowing in economic growth than the staff projected the risks to the inflation projection were also viewed as having a downward skew in part because of the down side risks to the forecast for economic activity participants views on current conditions and the economic outlook in conjunction with this fomc meeting members of the board of governors and federal reserve bank pres idents submitted their projections of the most likely out comes for real gdp growth the unemployment rate and inflation for each year from through and over the longer run based on their individual assess ments of the appropriate path for the federal funds rate the longerrun projections represented each partici pants assessment of the rate to which each variable would be expected to converge over time under appro priate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy these projections are described in the summary of economic projections which is an addendum to these minutes participants agreed that the labor market had remained strong over the intermeeting period and that economic activity had risen at a moderate rate job gains had been solid on average in recent months and the unemploy ment rate had remained low although household spending had risen at a strong pace business fixed in vestment and exports had weakened on a month basis overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy were running below percent market based measures of inflation compensation remained low surveybased measures of longerterm inflation ex pectations were little changed participants generally viewed the baseline economic out look as positive and indicated that their views of the most likely outcomes for economic activity and inflation had changed little since the july meeting however for most participants that economic outlook was premised on a somewhat more accommodative path for policy than in july participants generally had become more concerned about risks associated with trade tensions and adverse developments in the geopolitical and global eco nomic spheres in addition inflation pressures contin ued to be muted many participants expected that real gdp growth would moderate to around its potential rate in the second half of the year participants agreed that consumer spending was increasing at a strong pace they also expected that in the period ahead household spending would likely remain on a firm footing sup ported by strong labor market conditions rising in comes and accommodative financial conditions sev eral participants indicated that the housing sector was starting to rebound stimulated by a significant decline in mortgage rates with regard to the contrast between ro bust consumption growth and weak investment growth several participants mentioned that uncertainties in the business outlook and sustained weak investment could eventually lead to slower hiring which in turn could damp the growth of income and consumption in their discussion of the business sector participants saw trade tensions and concerns about the global out minutes of the meeting of september page look as the main factors weighing on business invest ment exports and manufacturing production partici pants judged that trade uncertainty and global develop ments would continue to affect firms investment spend ing and that this uncertainty was discouraging them from investing in their businesses a couple of partici pants noted that businesses had the capacity to adjust to ongoing uncertainty concerning trade and some firms were reconfiguring supply chains and making logistical arrangements as part of contingency planning to mitigate the effects of trade tensions on their businesses participants discussed developments in the manufactur ing and the agricultural sectors of the us economy manufacturing production remained lower than at the beginning of the year and recent indicators suggested that conditions were unlikely to improve materially over the near term participants saw the ongoing global slow down and trade uncertainty as contributing importantly to these declines a few participants noted ongoing challenges in the agricultural sector including those as sociated with tariffs weak export demand and more in tense financial burdens arising from the increase in car ryover debt in preceding years participants commented on the potential disruption to global oil production aris ing from the attack on saudi arabias facilities participants judged that conditions in the labor market remained strong with the unemployment rate near his torical lows and continued solid job gains on average in recent months the labor force participation rate of primeage individuals especially of primeage women moved up in august continuing its upward trajectory and the unemployment rate of african americans fell to its lowest rate on record however a number of partic ipants noted that although the labor market was clearly in a strong position the preliminary benchmark revision by the bureau of labor statistics indicated that payroll employment gains would likely show less momentum coming into this year when the revisions are incorpo rated in published data early next year a few partici pants observed that it would be important to be vigilant in monitoring incoming data for any sign of softening in labor market conditions that said reports from busi ness contacts in many districts pointed to continued strong labor demand with some firms still reporting dif ficulties finding qualified workers and others broadening their recruiting to include traditionally marginalized groups in some districts employers were also expand ing training and provision of nonwage benefits which could help sustain their expansion of hiring against a background of a very tight national labor market without spurring abovetrend aggregate wage growth some firms were also reluctant to raise wages because of their limited pricing power while others thought the wages they were offering were in line with the skill sets of the workers available to fill new positions participants gen erally viewed overall wage growth as broadly consistent with modest average rates of labor productivity growth in recent years and as exerting little upward pressure on inflation a couple of participants noted that with in flationary pressures remaining muted and wage growth moderate even as employment and spending expanded further they had again adjusted downward their esti mates of the longerrun normal unemployment rate in their discussion of inflation developments partici pants noted that despite a recent firming in the incom ing data readings on overall and core pce inflation had continued to run below the committees symmetric percent objective furthermore in light of weakness in the global economy perceptions of downside risks to growth and subdued inflation pressures some partici pants continued to view the risks to the outlook for in flation as weighted to the downside some participants however saw the recent inflation data as consistent with their previous assessment that much of the weakness seen early in the year was transitory in this connection several participants noted that recent monthly readings notably for cpi inflation seemed broadly consistent with the committees longerrun inflation objective of percent while the trimmed mean measure of pce in flation constructed by the federal reserve bank of dal las remained at percent in july in their discussion of the outlook for inflation partici pants generally agreed that under appropriate policy in flation would move up to the committees percent ob jective over the medium term participants saw inflation expectations as reasonably well anchored but many par ticipants observed that marketbased measures of infla tion compensation and some survey measures of con sumers inflation expectations were at historically low levels some of these participants further noted that longerterm inflation expectations could be somewhat below levels consistent with the committees percent inflation objective or that continued weakness in infla tion could prompt expectations to drift lower participants generally judged that downside risks to the outlook for economic activity had increased somewhat since their july meeting particularly those stemming from trade policy uncertainty and conditions abroad in addition although readings on the labor market and the overall economy continued to be strong a clearer picture page federal open market committee of protracted weakness in investment spending manu facturing production and exports had emerged partic ipants also noted that there continued to be a significant probability of a nodeal brexit and that geopolitical ten sions had increased in hong kong and the middle east several participants commented that in the wake of this increase in downside risk the weakness in business spending manufacturing and exports could give rise to slower hiring a development that would likely weigh on consumption and the overall economic outlook several participants noted that statistical models designed to gauge the probability of recession including those based on information from the yield curve suggested that the likelihood of a recession occurring over the medium term had increased notably in recent months however a couple of these participants stressed the difficulty of extracting the right signal from these probability models especially in the current period of unusually low levels of term premiums with regard to developments in financial markets par ticipants noted that longerterm us treasury rates had been volatile over the intermeeting period but on net had registered a sizable decline participants observed that a key source of downward pressure on treasury rates arose from flighttosafety flows driven by down side risks to global growth escalating trade tensions and disappointing global data low interest rates abroad were also considered an important influence on us longerterm rates participants expressed a range of views about the implications of low longerterm treas ury rates some participants judged that a prolonged in version of the yield curve could be a matter of concern participants also noted that equity prices had exhibited volatility but had been largely flat on balance over the intermeeting period several participants cited consider ations that led them to be concerned about financial sta bility including low risk spreads and a buildup of corpo rate debt corporate stock buybacks financed through lowcost leverage and the pace of lending in the cre market however several others pointed to signs that the financial system remained resilient in their consideration of the monetary policy options at this meeting most participants believed that a reduction of basis points in the target range for the federal funds rate would be appropriate in discussing the reasons for such a decision these participants pointed to considera tions related to the economic outlook risk management and the need to center inflation and inflation expecta tions on the committees longerrun objective of per cent participants noted that there had been little change in their economic outlook since the july meeting and that incoming data had continued to suggest that the pace of economic expansion was consistent with the mainte nance of strong labor market conditions however a couple of participants pointed out that data revisions an nounced in recent months implied that the economy had likely entered the year with somewhat less momentum than previously thought in addition data received since july had confirmed the weakening in business fixed in vestment and exports one risk that the economy faced was that the softness recorded of late in firms capital formation manufacturing and exporting activities might spread to their hiring decisions with adverse im plications for household income and spending partici pants observed that such an eventuality was not embed ded in their baseline outlook however a couple of them indicated that this was partly because they assumed that an appropriate adjustment to the policy rate path would help forestall that eventuality several also noted that because monetary policy actions affected economic ac tivity with a lag it was appropriate to provide the requi site policy accommodation now to support economic ac tivity over coming quarters participants favoring a modest adjustment to the stance of monetary policy at this juncture cited other risks to the economic outlook that further underscored the case for such a move as their discussion of risks had high lighted downside risks had become more pronounced since july trade uncertainty had increased prospects for global growth had become more fragile and various intermeeting developments had intensified geopolitical risks against this background riskmanagement con siderations implied that it would be prudent for the committee to adopt a somewhat more accommodative stance of policy in addition a number of participants suggested that a reduction at this meeting in the target range for the federal funds rate would likely better align the target range with a variety of indicators of the appro priate policy stance including those based on estimates of the neutral interest rate a few participants observed that the considerations favoring easing were reinforced by the proximity of the federal funds rate to the elb if policymakers provided adequate accommodation while still away from the elb this course of action would help forestall the possibility of a prolonged elb episode many participants also cited the level of inflation or in flation expectations as justifying a reduction of basis points in the federal funds rate at this meeting inflation had generally fallen short of the committees objective minutes of the meeting of september page for several years and notwithstanding some stronger re cent monthly readings on inflation the month rate was still below percent some estimates of trend infla tion were also below percent several participants ad ditionally stressed that survey measures of longerterm inflation expectations and marketbased measures of in flation compensation were near historical lows and that these values pointed to the possibility that inflation ex pectations were below levels consistent with the per cent objective or could soon fall below such levels against this backdrop participants suggested that a pol icy easing would help underline policymakers commit ment to the symmetric percent longerrun objective with inflation pressures muted and us inflation likely being weighed down by global disinflationary forces policymakers saw little chance of an outsized increase in inflation in response to additional policy accommoda tion and argued that such an increase should it occur could be addressed in a straightforward manner using conventional monetary policy tools several participants favored maintaining the existing tar get range for the federal funds rate at this meeting these participants suggested that the baseline projection for the economy had changed very little since the com mittees previous meeting and that the state of the econ omy and the economic outlook did not justify a shift away from the current policy stance which they felt was already adequately accommodative they acknowledged the uncertainties that currently figured importantly in evaluations of the economic outlook but they con tended that the key uncertainties were unlikely to be re solved soon furthermore as they did not believe that these uncertainties would derail the expansion they did not see further policy accommodation as needed at this time changes in the stance of policy they believed should instead occur only when the macroeconomic data readily justified those moves in this connection a couple of participants suggested that if it decided to pro vide more policy accommodation at the present junc ture the committee might be taking out too much in surance against possible future shocks leaving monetary policy with less scope to boost aggregate demand in the event that such shocks materialized a few of the par ticipants favoring an unchanged target range for the fed eral funds rate also expressed concern that an easing of monetary policy at this meeting could exacerbate finan cial imbalances a couple of participants indicated their preference for a basis point cut in the federal funds rate at this meet ing these participants suggested that a larger policy move would help reduce the risk of an economic down turn and would more appropriately recognize important recent developments such as slowing job gains weaken ing investment and continued low values of market based measures of inflation compensation in addition these participants stressed the need for a policy stance possibly one using enhanced forward guidancethat was sufficiently accommodative to make it unlikely that the united states would experience a protracted period of the kind seen abroad in which the economy became mired in a combination of undesirably low inflation weak economic activity and nearzero policy rates they also argued that it was desirable for the committee to seek and maintain a level of accommodation sufficient to deliver inflation at percent on a sustained basis and that such a policy would be consistent with inflation ex ceeding percent for a time with regard to monetary policy beyond this meeting participants agreed that policy was not on a preset course and would depend on the implications of incoming in formation for the evolution of the economic outlook a few participants judged that the expectations regarding the path of the federal funds rate implied by prices in financial markets were currently suggesting greater pro vision of accommodation at coming meetings than they saw as appropriate and that it might become necessary for the committee to seek a better alignment of market expectations regarding the policy rate path with policy makers own expectations for that path several partici pants suggested that the committees postmeeting state ment should provide more clarity about when the recal ibration of the level of the policy rate in response to trade uncertainty would likely come to an end participants discussion of recent money market developments the manager pro tem provided a summary of the most recent developments in money markets open market operations conducted on the previous day had helped to ease strains in money markets but the effr had none theless printed basis points above the top of the target range with significant pressures still evident in repo markets and the federal funds market and in accordance with the fomcs directive to maintain the federal funds rate within the target range the desk conducted another repo operation on the morning of the second day of the meeting the staff presented a proposal to lower the ioer rate and the overnight reverse repurchase agree ment rate by basis points relative to the target range for the federal funds rate in order to foster trading of federal funds within the target range page federal open market committee participants agreed that developments in money markets over recent days implied that the committee should soon discuss the appropriate level of reserve balances sufficient to support efficient and effective implementa tion of monetary policy in the context of the amplere serves regime that the committee had chosen a few participants noted the possibility of resuming trend growth of the balance sheet to help stabilize the level of reserves in the banking system participants agreed that any committee decision regarding the trend pace of bal ance sheet expansion necessary to maintain a level of re serve balances appropriate to facilitate policy implemen tation should be clearly distinguished from past large scale asset purchase programs that were aimed at altering the size and composition of the federal reserves asset holdings in order to provide monetary policy accommo dation and ease overall financial conditions several par ticipants suggested that such a discussion could benefit from also considering the merits of introducing a stand ing repurchase agreement facility as part of the frame work for implementing monetary policy committee policy action in their discussion of monetary policy for this meeting members noted that information received since the july meeting indicated that the labor market remained strong and that economic activity had been rising at a moderate rate job gains had been solid on average in recent months and the unemployment rate had remained low household spending had been rising at a strong pace however business fixed investment and exports had weakened and this outcome suggested that risks and un certainty associated with international trade develop ments and with ongoing weakness in global economic growth were continuing to weigh on the domestic econ omy on a month basis both the overall inflation rate and inflation for items other than food and energy were running below percent marketbased measures of inflation compensation remained low surveybased measures of longerterm inflation expectations were lit tle changed in light of these developments most mem bers agreed to lower the target range for the federal funds rate to to percent at this meeting with this adjustment to policy those members who sup ported the policy action sought to make the overall stance of monetary policy most consistent with helping to offset the effects on aggregate demand of weak global growth and trade policy uncertainty insure against fur ther downside risks arising from those sources and from geopolitical developments and promote a more rapid return of inflation to the committees symmetric per cent objective than would otherwise occur a couple of these members observed that because monetary policy actions affected aggregate spending with a lag the pre sent meeting was an appropriate occasion for providing accommodation that would support economic activity in the period ahead two members preferred to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate at this meeting these members noted that economic data re ceived over the intermeeting period had been largely positive and that they anticipated under an unchanged policy stance continued strong labor markets and solid growth in activity with inflation gradually moving up to the committees percent objective these members also suggested that providing further accommodation during a period of high economic activity and elevated asset prices could have adverse consequences for finan cial stability one member preferred a reduction in the target range of basis points in the federal funds rate at this meeting this member suggested that such a larger rate adjustment would be more consistent with the achievement of the committees objectives over time and in particular with helping preclude the possibility of a protracted period in which inflation and employ ment were below the committees objectives members agreed that in determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate the committee would assess realized and ex pected economic conditions relative to its maximum employment objective and its symmetric percent infla tion objective they also agreed that those assessments would take into account a wide range of information in cluding measures of labor market conditions indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations and readings on financial and international developments with regard to the postmeeting statement members agreed to update the language of the committees de scription of incoming data to acknowledge the weaken ing in investment spending and in us exports as well as the recent strong rate of increase of household spend ing at the conclusion of the discussion the committee voted to authorize and direct the federal reserve bank of new york until instructed otherwise to execute transactions in the soma in accordance with the fol lowing domestic policy directive to be released at pm effective september the federal open market committee directs the desk to undertake open market operations as necessary to maintain the federal funds rate in a target range of to percent including overnight minutes of the meeting of september page reverse repurchase operations and reverse re purchase operations with maturities of more than one day when necessary to accommodate weekend holiday or similar trading conven tions at an offering rate of percent in amounts limited only by the value of treasury securities held outright in the system open market account that are available for such op erations and by a percounterparty limit of billion per day the committee directs the desk to continue rolling over at auction all principal payments from the federal reserves holdings of treasury securities and to continue reinvesting all princi pal payments from the federal reserves hold ings of agency debt and agency mortgage backed securities received during each calendar month principal payments from agency debt and agency mortgagebacked securities up to billion per month will continue to be rein vested in treasury securities to roughly match the maturity composition of treasury securities outstanding principal payments in excess of billion per month will continue to be

the target range for the federal funds rate the committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its maximum employment objective and its sym metric percent inflation objective this as sessment will take into account a wide range of information including measures of labor mar ket conditions indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations and readings

against this action james bullard esther l george and eric rosengren president bullard dissented because he believed that lowering the target range for the federal funds rate by basis points at this time would provide insurance against further declines in expected inflation and a slow ing economy subject to elevated downside risks in ad dition a basis point cut at this time would help pro mote a more rapid return of inflation and inflation ex pectations to target president george dissented be cause she believed that an unchanged setting of policy was appropriate based on incoming data and the outlook for economic activity over the medium term recogniz ing the risks to the outlook from the effects of trade pol icy and weaker global activity president george would be prepared to adjust policy should incoming data point page federal open market committee to a materially weaker outlook for the economy presi dent rosengren dissented because he judged that mon etary policy was already accommodative in his view additional accommodation was not needed for an econ omy in which labor markets are already tight and could pose risks of further inflating the prices of risky assets and encouraging households and firms to take on too much leverage consistent with the committees decision to lower the target range for the federal funds rate to to percent the board of governors voted

the possibil ity that inflation expectations could be drifting below levels consistent with the fomcs percent inflation objective and the potential for weaker domestic demand to put downward pressure on inflation were viewed as downside risks a few participants noted the possibility that higher tariffs could lead to aggregate price pressure as a source of upside risk to inflation a number of par

open market committee forecast uncertainty the economic projections provided by the members of the board of governors and the presidents of the federal reserve banks inform discussions of monetary policy among policymakers and can aid public understanding of the basis for policy actions considerable uncertainty attends these projections however the economic and statistical models and relationships used to help produce economic forecasts are necessarily imperfect descriptions of the real world and the future path of the economy can be affected by myriad unforeseen developments and events thus in setting the stance of monetary policy participants consider not only what appears to be the most likely economic outcome as em bodied in their projections but also the range of alternative possibilities the likelihood of their occurring and the poten tial costs to the economy should they occur table summarizes the average historical accuracy of a range of forecasts including those reported in past monetary policy reports and those prepared by the federal reserve boards staff in advance of meetings of the federal open market committee fomc the projection error ranges shown in the table illustrate the considerable uncertainty as sociated with economic forecasts for example suppose a participant projects that real gross domestic product gdp and total consumer prices will rise steadily at annual rates of respectively percent and percent if the uncertainty at tending those projections is similar to that experienced in the past and the risks around the projections are broadly bal anced the numbers reported in table would imply a prob ability of about percent that actual gdp would expand within a range of to percent in the current year to percent in the second year to percent in the third year and to percent in the fourth year the corre sponding percent confidence intervals for overall infla tion would be to percent in the current year to percent in the second year to percent in the third year and to percent in the fourth year figures a through c illustrate these confidence bounds in fan charts that are symmetric and centered on the medians of fomc participants projections for gdp growth the unem ployment rate and inflation however in some instances the risks around the projections may not be symmetric in particular the unemployment rate cannot be negative fur thermore the risks around a particular projection might be tilted to either the upside or the downside in which case the corresponding fan chart would be asymmetrically positioned around the median projection because current conditions may differ from those that prevailed on average over history participants provide judgments as to whether the uncertainty attached to their projections of each economic variable is greater than smaller than or broadly similar to typical levels of forecast uncer tainty seen in the past years as presented in table and reflected in the widths of the confidence intervals shown in the top panels of figures a through c participants cur rent assessments of the uncertainty surrounding their projec tions are summarized in the bottomleft panels of those fig ures participants also provide judgments as to whether the risks to their projections are weighted to the upside are weighted to the downside or are broadly balanced that is while the symmetric historical fan charts shown in the top panels of figures a through c imply that the risks to par ticipants projections are balanced participants may judge that there is a greater risk that a given variable will be above rather than below their projections these judgments are summa rized in the lowerright panels of figures a through c as with real activity and inflation the outlook for the future path of the federal funds rate is subject to considerable uncertainty this uncertainty arises primarily because each participants assessment of the appropriate stance of mone tary policy depends importantly on the evolution of real ac tivity and inflation over time if economic conditions evolve in an unexpected manner then assessments of the appropri ate setting of the federal funds rate would change from that point forward the final line in table shows the error ranges for forecasts of shortterm interest rates they suggest that the historical confidence intervals associated with projections of the federal funds rate are quite wide it should be noted however that these confidence intervals are not strictly con sistent with the projections for the federal funds rate as these projections are not forecasts of the most likely quarterly out comes but rather are projections of participants individual as sessments of appropriate monetary policy and are on an end ofyear basis however the forecast errors should provide a sense of the uncertainty around the future path of the federal funds rate generated by the uncertainty about the macroeco nomic variables as well as additional adjustments to monetary policy that would be appropriate to offset the effects of shocks to the economy if at some point in the future the confidence interval around the federal funds rate were to extend below zero it would be truncated at zero for purposes of the fan chart shown in figure zero is the bottom of the lowest target range for the federal funds rate that has been adopted by the committee in the past this approach to the construction of the federal funds rate fan chart would be merely a convention it would not have any implications for possible future policy decisions regarding the use of negative interest rates to pro vide additional monetary policy accommodation if doing so were appropriate in such situations the committee could also employ other tools including forward guidance and asset purchases to provide additional accommodation while figures a through c provide information on the uncertainty around the economic projections figure provides information on the range of views across fomc participants a comparison of figure with figures a through c shows that the dispersion of the projections across participants is much smaller than the

senior research economist and advisor federal reserve bank of dallas benjamin malin senior research economist federal reserve bank of minneapolis attended the discussion of economic developments and the outlook attended the discussion of developments in financial mar kets and open market operations through the end of the meet ing page federal open market committee review of monetary policy strategy tools and communication practices committee participants continued their discussions re lated to the ongoing review of the federal reserves monetary policy strategy tools and communication practices staff briefings provided an assessment of a range of monetary policy tools that the committee could employ to provide additional economic stimulus and bolster inflation outcomes particularly in future epi sodes in which the policy rate would be constrained by the effective lower bound elb the staff first dis cussed policy rate tools focusing on three forms of for ward guidancequalitative which provides a nonspe cific indication of the expected duration of accommoda tion datebased which specifies a date beyond which accommodation could start to be reduced and outcome based which ties the possible start of a reduction of ac commodation to the achievement of certain macroeco nomic outcomes the briefing addressed communica tions challenges associated with each form of forward guidance including the need to avoid conveying a more negative economic outlook than the fomc expects nonetheless the staff suggested that forward guidance generally had been effective in easing financial condi tions and stimulating economic activity in circumstances when the policy rate was above the elb and when it was at the elb the briefing also discussed negative interest rates a policy option implemented by several foreign central banks the staff noted that although the evi dence so far suggested that this tool had provided ac commodation in jurisdictions where it had been em ployed there were also indications of possible adverse side effects moreover differences between the us fi nancial system and the financial systems of those juris dictions suggested that the foreign experience may not provide a useful guide in assessing whether negative rates would be effective in the united states the second part of the staff briefing focused on balance sheet policy tools the staff discussed the benefits and costs associated with the largescale asset purchase pro grams implemented by the federal reserve after the fi nancial crisis in general the staffs review of the histor ical experience suggested that the benefits of largescale asset purchase programs were significant and that many of the potential costs of such programs identified at the time either did not materialize or materialized to a smaller degree than initially feared in addition the staff presentation noted thattaking account of investor ex pectations ahead of the announcement of each new pro gramthe effects of asset purchases did not appear to have diminished materially across consecutive programs however going forward such policies might not be as effective because longerterm interest rates would likely be much lower at the onset of a future asset purchase program than they were before the financial crisis the staff also compared the benefits and costs associated with asset purchase programs that are of a fixed cumu lative size and those that are flowbasedwhere pur chases continue at a specific pace until certain macroe conomic outcomes are achievedand examined the po tential effectiveness of using asset purchases to place ceilings on interest rates the briefing also discussed lending programs that could facilitate the flow of credit to households or businesses participants discussed the relative merits of qualitative datebased and outcomebased forward guidance a number of participants noted that each of these three forms of forward guidance could be effective in provid ing accommodation depending on circumstances both at and away from the elb they also suggested that different types of forward guidance would likely be needed to address varying economic conditions and that the communications regarding forward guidance needed to be tailored to explain the committees evaluation of the economic outlook in particular several participants emphasized that to guard against the possibility of ad verse feedback loops in which forward guidance is inter preted by the public as a sign of a sharply deteriorating economic outlook thus leading households and busi nesses to become even more cautious in their spending decisions the committee would need to clearly com municate how its announced policy could help promote better economic outcomes participants saw both ben efits and costs associated with outcomebased forward guidance relative to other forms of forward guidance on the one hand relative to qualitative or datebased forward guidance outcomebased forward guidance has the advantage of creating an explicit link between future monetary policy actions and macroeconomic conditions thereby helping to support economic stabilization ef forts and foster transparency and accountability on the other hand outcomebased forward guidance could be complex and difficult to explain and hence could po tentially be less effective than qualitative or datebased forward guidance if those hurdles could not be over come a few participants commented that outcome based forward guidance tied to inflation outcomes could be a useful tool to reinforce the committees com mitment to its symmetric percent objective participants also discussed the benefits and costs of us ing different types of balance sheet policy participants minutes of the meeting of october page generally agreed that the balance sheet policies imple mented by the federal reserve after the crisis had eased financial conditions and had contributed to the eco nomic recovery and that those tools had become an im portant part of the committees current toolkit how ever some participants pointed out that research had produced a sizable range of estimates of the magnitude of the economic effects of balance sheet actions in ad dition some participants noted that the effectiveness of these tools might be diminished in the future as longer term interest rates have declined to very low levels and would likely be even lower following an adverse shock that could lead to the resumption of largescale asset purchases as a result there might be limited scope for balance sheet tools to provide accommodation several participants commented on the advantages and disad vantages of flowbased asset purchase programs tied to the achievement of economic outcomes on the one hand such programs adjusted automatically in response to the performance of the economy and hence were more straightforward to implement and communicate on the other hand flowbased asset purchase programs may result in the balance sheet rising to undesirable lev els a few participants also commented that barring sig nificant dislocations to particular segments of the mar kets they would restrict asset purchases to treasury se curities to avoid perceptions that the federal reserve was engaging in credit allocation across sectors of the economy in considering policy tools that the federal reserve had not used in the recent past participants discussed the benefits and costs of using balance sheet tools to cap rates on short or longmaturity treasury securities through open market operations as necessary a few participants saw benefits to capping longerterm interest rates that more directly influence household and busi ness spending in addition capping longermaturity in terest rates using balance sheet tools if judged as credi ble by market participants might require a smaller amount of asset purchases to provide a similar amount of accommodation as a quantitybased program pur chasing longermaturity securities however many par ticipants raised concerns about capping longterm rates some of those participants noted that uncertainty re garding the neutral federal funds rate and regarding the effects of rate ceiling policies on future interest rates and inflation made it difficult to determine the appropriate level of the rate ceiling or when that ceiling should be removed that maintaining a rate ceiling could result in an elevated level of the federal reserves balance sheet or significant volatility in its size or maturity composi tion or that managing longerterm interest rates might be seen as interacting with the federal debt management process by contrast a majority of participants saw greater benefits in using balance sheet tools to cap shorterterm interest rates and reinforce forward guid ance about the nearterm path of the policy rate all participants judged that negative interest rates cur rently did not appear to be an attractive monetary policy tool in the united states participants commented that there was limited scope to bring the policy rate into neg ative territory that the evidence on the beneficial effects of negative interest rates abroad was mixed and that it was unclear what effects negative rates might have on the willingness of financial intermediaries to lend and on the spending plans of households and businesses par ticipants noted that negative interest rates would entail risks of introducing significant complexity or distortions to the financial system in particular some participants cautioned that the financial system in the united states is considerably different from those in countries that im plemented negative interest rate policies and that nega tive rates could have more significant adverse effects on market functioning and financial stability here than abroad notwithstanding these considerations partici pants did not rule out the possibility that circumstances could arise in which it might be appropriate to reassess the potential role of negative interest rates as a policy tool overall participants generally agreed that the forward guidance and balance sheet policies followed by the fed eral reserve after the financial crisis had been effective in providing stimulus at the elb with estimates of equilibrium real interest rates having declined notably over recent decades policymakers saw less room to re duce the federal funds rate to support the economy in the event of a downturn in addition against a back ground of inflation undershooting the symmetric per cent objective for several years some participants raised the concern that the scope to reduce the federal funds rate to provide support to economic activity in future recessions could be reduced further if inflation shortfalls continued and led to a decline in inflation expectations therefore participants generally agreed it was important for the committee to keep a wide range of tools available and employ them as appropriate to support the econ omy doing so would help ensure the anchoring of in flation expectations at a level consistent with the com mittees symmetric percent inflation objective page federal open market committee some participants noted that the form of the policy re sponse would depend critically on the circumstances the committee faced at the time several participants sug gested that communicating to the public clearly and con vincingly in advance about how the committee intended to provide accommodation at the elb would enhance public confidence and support the effectiveness of whichever tool the committee selected some partici pants thought it would be helpful for the committee to evaluate how its tools could be utilized in different eco nomic scenarios such as when longerterm interest rates were significantly below current levels and discuss which actions would best address the challenges posed by each scenario several participants noted that partic ularly if monetary policy became severely constrained at the elb expansionary fiscal policy would be especially important in addressing an economic downturn participants expected that at upcoming meetings they would continue their deliberations on the committees review of the monetary policy framework as well as the committees statement on longerrun goals and mon etary policy strategy they also generally agreed that the committees consideration of possible modifications to its policy strategy tools and communication practices would take some time and that the process would be careful deliberate and patient a number of partici pants judged that the review could be completed around the middle of developments in financial markets and open mar ket operations the manager pro tem first reviewed developments in fi nancial markets over the intermeeting period early in the period market participants focused on signs of weakness in us economic data with some soft data from business surveys viewed as substantiating concerns that global headwinds were spilling over to the us economy later in the period markets responded to news suggesting favorable developments around brexit and a partial uschina trade deal on balance us fi nancial conditions ended the period little changed regarding the outlook for us monetary policy the open market desks surveys and marketbased indica tors pointed to a high likelihood of a basis point cut in the target range at the october meeting the proba bility that survey respondents placed on this outcome was broadly similar to the probability of a basis point cut ahead of the july and september meetings further ahead the path implied by the medians of survey re spondents modal forecasts for the federal funds rate re mained essentially flat after this meeting meanwhile the marketimplied path suggested that investors expected around basis points of additional easing by the end of after the anticipated easing at this meeting the manager pro tem next turned to a review of money market developments since early october on octo ber the committee announced its decision to main tain reserves at or above the level that prevailed in early september through a program of treasury bill purchases and repurchase agreement repo operations after the announcement the desk conducted regular operations that offered at least billion in overnight repo funding and between and billion in term funding these operations fostered conditions that helped main tain the federal funds rate within the target range through two channels first they provided funding in repo markets that dampened repo market pressure that would otherwise have passed through to the federal funds market and second they increased the supply of reserves in the banking system in anticipation of an other projected sharp decline in reserves and expected rate pressures around october the desk announced an increase in the size of overnight repos to billion and an increase in the size of the two term repo opera tions that crossed the october monthend to billion with respect to purchases of treasury bills for reserve management purposes the desk had purchased more than half of the initial billion monthly amount for october and propositions at the five operations con ducted to date had been strong respondents to the desk surveys expected reserve management purchases of treasury bills to continue at the same pace for some time the combination of repo operations and bill pur chases lifted reserve levels above those observed in early september the manager pro tem noted that diminished willingness of some dealers to intermediate across money markets ahead of the yearend could result in upward pressure on shortterm money market rates forward measures of market pricing continued to indicate expectations for such pressures around the yearend the desk planned to continue its close monitoring of reserves and money market conditions as well as dealer participation in repo operations particularly given balance sheet constraints heading into yearend the desk discussed its intentions to further adjust operations around yearend as needed to mitigate the risk of money market pressures that could adversely affect policy implementation and to maintain over time a level of reserve balances at or above those that prevailed in early september minutes of the meeting of october page the manager pro tem finished by noting that the federal reserve bank of new york would soon release a request for public comment on a plan to publish a series of back ward looking secured overnight financing rate sofr averages and a daily sofr index to support the transi tion away from instruments based on libor london interbank offered rate publication of these series was expected to begin in the first half of by unanimous vote the committee ratified the desks domestic transactions over the intermeeting period there were no intervention operations in foreign curren cies for the systems account during the intermeeting pe riod review of options for repo operations to support control of the federal funds rate the staff briefed participants on the recent experience with using repo operations to support control of the fed eral funds rate and on possibly maintaining a role for repo operations in the monetary policy implementation framework over the longer run ongoing capacity for repo operations could be viewed as useful in an ample reserves regime as a way of providing insurance against unexpected stresses in money markets that could drive the federal funds rate outside the committees target range over a sustained period the staff presented two potential approaches for conducting repo operations if the committee decided to maintain an ongoing role for such operations under the first approach the desk would conduct modestly sized relatively frequent repo operations designed to provide a high degree of readi ness should the need for larger operations arise under the second approach the fomc would establish a standing fixedrate facility that could serve as an auto matic money market stabilizer assessing these two ap proaches involved several considerations including the degree of assurance of control over the federal funds rate the likelihood that participation in the federal re serves repo operations could become stigmatized the possibility that the operations could encourage the fed eral reserves counterparties to take on excessive liquid ity risks in their portfolios and the potential disinterme diation of financial transactions currently undertaken by private counterparties regular modestly sized repo op erations likely would pose relatively little risk of stigma or moral hazard but they may provide less assurance of control over the federal funds rate because it might be difficult for the federal reserve to anticipate money the staff briefed the committee in june on the possible role of a standing repo facility in the monetary policy imple mentation framework market pressures and scale up its repo operations ac cordingly a standing fixedrate repo facility would likely provide substantial assurance of control over the federal funds rate but use of the facility could become stigmatized particularly if the rate was set at a relatively high level conversely a standing facility with a rate set at a relatively low level could result in larger and more frequent repo operations than would be appropriate and by effectively standing ready to provide a form of liquidity on an asneeded basis such a facility could in crease the risk that some institutions may take on an un desirably high amount of liquidity risk in their comments following the staff presentation par ticipants emphasized the importance of maintaining re serves at a level consistent with the committees choice of an amplereserves monetary policy implementation framework in which control over the level of the federal funds rate is exercised primarily through the setting of the federal reserves administered rates and in which active management of the supply of reserves is not re quired some participants indicated that in such an en vironment they would have some tolerance for allowing the federal funds rate to vary from day to day and to move occasionally outside its target range especially in those instances associated with easily identifiable tech nical events a couple of participants expressed discom fort with such misses participants expressed a range of views on the relative merits of the two approaches described by the staff for conducting repo operations many participants noted that once an ample supply of reserves is firmly estab lished there might be little need for a standing repo fa cility or for frequent repo operations some of these participants indicated that a basic principle in imple menting an amplereserves framework is to maintain re serves on an ongoing basis at levels that would obviate the need for open market operations to address pres sures in funding markets in all but exceptional circum stances many participants remarked however that even in an environment with ample reserves a standing facility could serve as a useful backstop to support con trol of the federal funds rate in the event of outsized shocks to the system several of these participants also suggested that if a standing facility were created that al lowed banks to monetize a portion of their securities holdings at times of market stress banks could possibly reduce their demand for reserves in normal times which page federal open market committee could make it feasible for the monetary policy imple mentation framework to operate with a significantly smaller quantity of reserves than would otherwise be needed a couple of participants pointed out that estab lishing a standing facility would be similar to the practice of some other major central banks a number of partic ipants noted that before deciding whether to implement a standing repo facility additional work would be neces sary to assess the likely implications of different design choices for a standing repo facility such as pricing eligi ble counterparties and the set of acceptable collateral echoing issues raised at the committees june meeting various participants commented on the need to carefully evaluate these design choices to guard against the potential for moral hazard stigma disintermediation risk or excessive volatility in the federal reserves bal ance sheet a couple of other participants suggested that an approach based on modestly sized frequent repo op erations that could be quickly and substantially ramped up in response to emerging market pressures would mit igate the moral hazard disintermediation and stigmati zation risks associated with a standing repo facility participants made no decisions at this meeting on the longerrun role of repo operations in the amplereserves regime or on an approach for conducting repo opera tions over the longer run they generally agreed that they should continue to monitor the market effects of the federal reserves ongoing repo operations and treasury bill purchases and that additional analysis of the recent period of money market dislocations or of fluctu ations in the federal reserves nonreserve liabilities was warranted some participants called for further research on the role that the financial regulatory environment or other factors may have played in the recent dislocations staff review of the economic situation the information available for the october meet ing indicated that labor market conditions remained strong and that real gross domestic product gdp in creased at a moderate rate in the third quarter con sumer price inflation as measured by the month per centage change in the price index for personal consump tion expenditures pce remained below

a stronger gain in the second quarter overall consumer spending rose steadily in recent months and sales of light motor vehicles through september maintained their robust secondquarter pace key factors that influence consumer spendingincluding the low unemployment rate further gains in real disposable income high levels of households net worth and generally low borrowing rateswere supportive of solid real pce growth in the near term the michigan survey measure of consumer minutes of the meeting of october page sentiment rose again in october and had mostly recov ered from its august slump while the conference board survey measure of consumer confidence remained at a favorable level real residential investment turned up solidly in the third quarter following six consecutive quarters of contrac tion this upturn was consistent with the rise in single family starts in the third quarter and building permits for such unitswhich tend to be a good indicator for the underlying trend in the construction of such homesalso increased both new and existing home sales increased on net in august and september taken together the data on construction and sales suggested that the decline in mortgage rates since late was starting to show through to housing activity real nonresidential private fixed investment declined further in the third quarter nominal shipments of non defense capital goods excluding aircraft decreased over august and september and forwardlooking indicators generally pointed to continued softness in business equipment spending orders for nondefense capital goods

nondefense spending federal hiring of temporary workers for next years decennial census was quite modest during the quarter real purchases by state and local governments also rose at a slower pace as the boost from a faster expansion in state and local payrolls was partially offset by a decrease in real con struction spending by these governments the nominal us international trade deficit widened in august reflecting a subdued pace of export growth and a moderate pace of import growth export growth was subdued due to lackluster exports of services and capital goods advance estimates for september suggested that goods imports fell more than exports pointing to a nar rowing of the monthly trade deficit the bureau of eco nomic analysis estimated that net exports made a slight negative contribution to real gdp growth in the third quarter incoming data suggested that growth in the foreign economies remained subpar in the third quarter in sev eral advanced foreign economies afes indicators showed continued weakness in the manufacturing sec tor especially in the euro area and the united kingdom similarly gdp growth remained subdued in china and several other emerging economies

activity september fomc communications were viewed as slightly less accommodative than expected with inves tors reportedly surprised by the summary of economic projections showing that a majority of fomc partici pants anticipated no further easing this year incoming data early in the intermeeting periodparticularly the disappointing readings on business activityprompted a decline in the marketimplied path for the policy rate but that decline was later partly reversed as market par ticipants apparently grew more optimistic on the pro spects for a uschina trade deal and brexit negotia tions late in the period quotes on federal funds futures page federal open market committee options contracts indicated that market participants as signed a very high probability to a basis point

negotiable certificates of deposit declined fairly quickly following the announcement of desk op erations on september although some cp rates re mained elevated into october the fomcs octo ber announcement of treasury bill purchases and repo operations to maintain reserves at or above their earlyseptember level appeared to improve expectations about funding market conditions through the

dollar the british pound appreciated on brexit developments and the ar gentinian peso continued to depreciate amid the coun trys political developments the midseptember increases in us treasury repo rates spilled over to borrowing rates in the international dollar funding market however the measures taken by the federal reserve to keep the federal funds rate in the tar get range also calmed dollar funding conditions in the foreign exchange swap market financing conditions for nonfinancial businesses re mained generally accommodative during the intermeet ing period gross issuance of corporate bonds which was strong in september experienced a typical seasonal decline in october gross issuance of institutional lev eraged loans remained solid but slightly below monthly averages meanwhile growth of commercial and industrial ci loans at banks was modest in the third quarter as a whole respondents to the october senior loan officer opinion survey on bank lending practices sloos reported that borrower de mand weakened for ci loans over the third quarter while lending standards on such loans were about un changed gross equity issuance through both initial and seasoned offerings picked up to a strong pace in septem ber but moderated in october the credit quality of nonfinancial corporations deteriorated slightly in recent months but remained solid on balance credit condi tions for both small businesses and municipalities stayed accommodative on net in the commercial real estate cre sector financing conditions also remained generally accommodative the volume of agency and nonagency commercial mort gagebacked securities issuance was strong in septem ber in part supported by recent declines in interest rates growth of cre loans on banks books was little changed in the third quarter banks in the october sloos reported tighter lending standards for all types of cre loans they also reported weaker demand for construction lending and stronger demand for the other cre lending categories minutes of the meeting of october page financing conditions in the residential mortgage market remained accommodative on balance mortgage rates were little changed since the september fomc meeting and stayed near their lowest level since mid in september homepurchase originations remained around the relatively high level seen during the previous two months while refinancing originations jumped to their highest level since late in the october sloos banks left their lending standards basically un changed for most residential real estate loan categories over the third quarter however for subprime loans a moderate net percentage of banks reported tightening standards financing conditions in consumer credit markets re mained generally supportive of household spending al though conditions continued to be tight for credit card borrowers with nonprime credit scores interest rates on auto loans fell on net since the beginning of the year and interest rates on credit card accounts leveled off through august according to the october sloos commercial banks tightened their standards on credit cards and other consumer loans over the third quarter additionally banks reported that their standards on auto loans and their willingness to make consumer install ment loans were about unchanged on balance the staff provided an update on its assessments of po tential risks to financial stability on balance the staff characterized the financial vulnerabilities of the us fi nancial system as moderate the staff judged that for many asset classes valuation pressures eased over the past year appetite for risk in the leveraged loan market remained elevated but less so than last year especially for lowerrated loans in addition cre prices remained high relative to rental income in assessing vulnerabili ties stemming from borrowing in the household and business sectors the staff noted that while household borrowing continued to decline relative to nominal gdp business leverage remained at or near recordhigh levels the risks associated with leverage at financial in stitutions were viewed as being low as they have been for some time largely because of high capital ratios at large banks nonetheless the staff noted that the resili ence of financial institutions could be undermined by low interest rates and banks announced plans to in crease payouts to shareholders the staff assessed vul nerabilities stemming from funding risk as modest in addition the staff discussed the potential for liquidity transformation by openended mutual funds investing in bank loans to lead to market dislocations under stress scenarios while noting that outflows from such funds have not often been associated with such dislocations staff economic outlook the projection for us real gdp growth prepared by the staff for the october fomc meeting was revised down a little for the second half of this year relative to the previous projection this revision reflected the esti mated effects of the strike at general motors along with some other small factors even without this downward revision real gdp was forecast to rise more slowly in the second half of the year than in the first half mostly because of continued soft business investment and slower increases in government spending the medium term projection for real gdp growth was essentially un changed as revisions to the staffs assumptions about factors on which the forecast was conditioned such as financial market variables were small and offsetting real gdp was expected to decelerate modestly over the medium term mostly because of a waning boost from fiscal policy output was forecast to expand at a rate a little above the staffs estimate of its potential rate of growth in and and then to slow to a pace slightly below potential output growth in and the unemployment rate was projected to be roughly flat through and to remain below the staffs estimate of its longerrun natural rate the staffs forecast for core pce price inflation this year was revised down a little in response to recent data be yond this year the projection for core inflation was un revised and the forecast for total inflation was a little lower in because of a downward revision in pro jected consumer energy prices both total inflation and core inflation were forecast to move up slightly next year as the low inflation readings early this year were viewed as transitory nevertheless both inflation measures were forecast to continue to run somewhat be low percent through the staff continued to view the uncertainty around its projections for real gdp growth the unemployment rate and inflation as generally similar to the average of the past years moreover the staff still judged that the risks to the forecast for real gdp growth were tilted to the downside with a corresponding skew to the up side for the unemployment rate important factors in that assessment were that international trade tensions and foreign economic developments seemed more likely to move in directions that could have significant nega tive effects on the us economy than to resolve more favorably than assumed in addition softness in busi ness investment and manufacturing so far this year was seen as pointing to the possibility of a more substantial slowing in economic growth than the staff projected the risks to the inflation projection were also viewed as page federal open market committee having a downward skew in part because of the down side risks to the forecast for economic activity participants views on current conditions and the economic outlook participants agreed that the labor market had remained strong over the intermeeting period and that economic activity had risen at a moderate rate job gains had been solid on average in recent months and the unemploy ment rate had remained low although household spending had risen at a strong pace business fixed in vestment and exports had remained weak on a month basis overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy were running below per cent marketbased measures of inflation compensation remained low surveybased measures of longerterm in flation expectations were little changed participants generally viewed the economic outlook as positive participants judged that sustained expansion of economic activity strong labor market conditions and inflation near the committees symmetric percent ob jective were the most likely outcomes and they indicated that their views on these outcomes had changed little since the september meeting uncertainties associated with trade tensions as well as geopolitical risks had eased somewhat though they remained elevated in addition inflation pressures remained muted the risk that a global growth slowdown would further weigh on the do mestic economy remained prominent in their discussion of the household sector participants agreed that consumer spending was increasing at a strong pace they also generally expected that in the period ahead household spending would likely remain on a firm footing supported by strong labor market con ditions rising incomes and favorable financial condi tions in addition survey measures of consumer confi dence remained high and a couple of participants com mented that business contacts in consumerfacing indus tries reported strong demand many participants noted that components of household spending that are thought to be particularly sensitive to interest rates had improved including purchases of consumer durables in addition residential investment had turned up most participants who reported on spending by households in their districts also cited favorable conditions for con sumer spending although several participants reported mixed data on spending or an increase in precautionary savings in their districts in their discussions of the business sector participants saw trade tensions and concerns about the global growth outlook as the main factors contributing to weak busi ness investment and exports and the associated restraint on domestic economic growth moreover participants generally expected that trade uncertainty and sluggish global growth would continue to damp investment spending and exports a number of participants judged that tight labor market conditions were also causing firms to forego investment expenditures or invest in au tomation systems to reduce the need for additional hir ing however business sentiment appeared to remain strong for some industries particularly those most closely connected with consumer goods participants discussed developments in the manufactur ing energy and agricultural sectors of the us economy manufacturing production remained weak and continu ing concerns about global growth and trade uncertainty suggested that conditions were unlikely to improve ma terially over the near term in addition the labor strike at general motors had disrupted motor vehicle output and ongoing issues at boeing were slowing manufactur ing in the commercial aircraft industry a couple of par ticipants noted that activity was particularly weak for the energy industry in part because of low petroleum prices in addition a few participants noted ongoing challenges in the agricultural sector including those associated with lower crop yields tariffs weak export demand and dif ficult financial positions for many farmers one bright spot for the agricultural sector was that some commod ity prices had firmed recently participants judged that conditions in the labor market remained strong with the unemployment rate near his torical lows and continued solid job gains on average in addition some participants commented on the strength or improvement in labor force participation na tionally or in their districts however the pace of in creases in employment had slowed some on net in re cent months on the one hand the slowing could be interpreted as a natural consequence of the economy be ing near full employment on the other hand slowing job gains might also be indicative of some cooling in la bor demand which may be consistent with an observed decline in the rate of job openings and decreases in other measures of labor market tightness several participants commented that the preliminary benchmark revision re leased in august by the bureau of labor statistics had indicated that payroll employment gains would likely show less momentum coming into this year once those revisions are incorporated in published data early next year growth of wages had also slowed this year by some measures consistent with strong national data on minutes of the meeting of october page the labor market business contacts in many districts in dicated continued strong labor demand with firms still reporting difficulties finding qualified workers or broad ening their recruiting to include traditionally marginal ized groups in their discussion of inflation developments partici pants noted that readings on overall and core pce infla tion measured on a month change basis had contin ued to run below the committees symmetric percent objective while surveybased measures of longerterm inflation expectations were generally little changed some measures of households inflation expectations had moved down to historically low levels marketbased measures of inflation compensation remained low with some longerterm measures being at or near multiyear lows weakness in the global economy perceptions of downside risks to growth and subdued global inflation pressures were cited as factors tilting inflation risk to the downside and a few participants commented that they expected inflation to run below percent for some time some other participants however saw the recent infla tion data as consistent with their previous assessment that much of the weakness seen early in the year would be transitory or that some recent monthly readings seemed broadly consistent with the committees longer run inflation objective of percent a couple of partic ipants noted that some measures of inflation could tem porarily move above percent early next year because of the transitory effects of tariffs participants also discussed risks regarding the outlook for economic activity which remained tilted to the downside some risks were seen to have eased a bit al though they remained elevated there were some tenta tive signs that trade tensions were easing the probability of a nodeal brexit was judged to have lessened and some other geopolitical tensions had diminished sev eral participants noted that statistical models designed to gauge the probability of recession including those based on information from the yield curve suggested that the likelihood of a recession occurring over the medium term had fallen somewhat over the intermeeting period however other downside risks had not diminished in particular some further signs of a global slowdown in economic growth emerged weakening in the global economy could further restrain the domestic economy and the risk that the weakness in domestic business spending manufacturing and exports could give rise to slower hiring and weigh on household spending re mained prominent among those participants who commented on financial stability most highlighted the risks associated with high levels of corporate indebtedness and elevated valuation pressures for a variety of risky assets although financial stability risks overall were seen as moderate several par ticipants indicated that imbalances in the corporate debt market had grown over the economic expansion and raised the concern that deteriorating credit quality could lead to sharp increases in risk spreads in corporate bond markets these developments could amplify the effects of an adverse shock to the economy several partici pants were concerned that some banks had reduced the sizes of their capital buffers at a time when they should be rising a few participants observed that valuations in equity and bond markets were high by historical stand ards and that cre valuations were also elevated a cou ple of participants indicated that market participants may be overly optimistic in the pricing of risk for corporate debt a couple of participants judged that the monitor ing of financial stability vulnerabilities should also en compass risks related to climate change in their consideration of the monetary policy options at this meeting most participants believed that a reduction of basis points in the target range for the federal funds rate would be appropriate in discussing the reasons for such a decision these participants continued to point to global developments weighing on the economic outlook the need to provide insurance against potential downside risks to the economic outlook and the importance of returning inflation to the committees symmetric per cent objective on a sustained basis a couple of partici pants who were supportive of a rate cut at this meeting indicated that the decision to reduce the federal funds rate by basis points was a close call relative to the op tion of leaving the federal funds rate unchanged at this meeting many participants judged that an additional modest eas ing at this meeting was appropriate in light of persistent weakness in global growth and elevated uncertainty re garding trade developments nonetheless these partic ipants noted that incoming data had continued to sug gest that the economy had proven resilient in the face of continued headwinds from global developments and that previous adjustments to monetary policy would continue to help sustain economic growth in addition several participants suggested that a modest easing of policy at this meeting would likely better align the target range for the federal funds rate with a variety of indica tors used to assess the appropriate policy stance includ ing estimates of the neutral interest rate and the slope of the yield curve a couple of participants judged that page federal open market committee there was more room for the labor market to improve accordingly they saw further accommodation as best supporting both of the committees dualmandate ob jectives many participants continued to view the downside risks surrounding the economic outlook as elevated further underscoring the case for a rate cut at this meeting in particular risks to the outlook associated with global economic growth and international trade were still seen as significant despite some encouraging geopolitical and traderelated developments over the intermeeting pe riod in light of these risks a number of participants were concerned that weakness in business spending manufacturing and exports could spill over to labor markets and consumer spending and threaten the eco nomic expansion a few participants observed that the considerations favoring easing at this meeting were rein forced by the proximity of the federal funds rate to the elb in their view providing adequate accommodation while still away from the elb would best mitigate the possibility of a costly return to the elb many participants also cited the level of inflation or in flation expectations as justifying a reduction of basis points in the federal funds rate at this meeting inflation continued to run below the committees symmetric percent objective and inflationary pressures remained muted several participants raised concerns that measures of inflation expectations remained low and could decline further without a more accommodative policy stance a couple of these participants pointing to experiences in japan and the euro area were con cerned that persistent inflation shortfalls could lead to a decline in longerrun inflation expectations and less room to reduce the federal funds rate in the event of a future recession in general the participants who justi fied further easing at this meeting based on considera tions related to inflation viewed this action as helping to move inflation up to the committees percent objec tive on a sustained basis and to anchor inflation expec tations at levels consistent with that objective some participants favored maintaining the existing tar get range for the federal funds rate at this meeting these participants suggested that the baseline projection for the economy remained favorable with inflation ex pected to move up and stay near the committees per cent objective they also judged that policy accommo dation was already adequate and in light of lags in the transmission of monetary policy preferred to take some time to assess the economic effects of the committees previous policy actions before easing policy further several participants noted that downside risks had di minished over the intermeeting period and saw little in dication that weakness in business sentiment was spilling over into labor markets and consumer spending a few participants raised the concern that a further easing of monetary policy at this meeting could encourage exces sive risktaking and exacerbate imbalances in the finan cial sector with regard to monetary policy beyond this meeting most participants judged that the stance of policy after a basis point reduction at this meeting would be well calibrated to support the outlook of moderate growth a strong labor market and inflation near the committees symmetric percent objective and likely would remain so as long as incoming information about the economy did not result in a material reassessment of the economic outlook however participants noted that policy was not on a preset course and that they would be monitor ing the effects of the committees recent policy actions as well as other information bearing on the economic outlook in assessing the appropriate path of the target range for the federal funds rate a couple of participants expressed the view that the committee should reinforce its postmeeting statement with additional communica tions indicating that another reduction in the federal funds rate was unlikely in the near term unless incoming information was consistent with a significant slowdown in the pace of economic activity committee policy action in their discussion of monetary policy for this meeting members noted that information received since the sep tember meeting indicated that the labor market re mained strong and that economic activity had been ris ing at a moderate rate job gains had been solid on av erage in recent months and the unemployment rate had remained low household spending had been rising at a strong pace however business fixed investment and exports remained weak as softness in global growth and international trade developments continued to weigh on those sectors on a month basis both the overall inflation rate and inflation for items other than food and energy were running below percent marketbased measures of inflation compensation remained low sur veybased measures of longerterm inflation expecta tions were little changed in light of the implications of global developments for the economic outlook as well as muted inflation pres sures most members agreed to lower the target range for the federal funds rate to to percent at this meeting the members who supported this action minutes of the meeting of october page viewed it as consistent with helping offset the effects on aggregate demand of weak global growth and trade de velopments insuring against downside risks arising from those sources and promoting a more rapid return of in flation to the committees symmetric percent objec tive two members preferred to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate at this meeting these members indicated that the economic outlook re mained positive and that they anticipated under an un changed policy stance continued strong labor market conditions and solid growth in activity with inflation gradually moving up to the committees percent ob jective members agreed that in determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate the committee would assess realized and ex pected economic conditions relative to its maximum employment objective and its symmetric percent infla tion objective they also agreed that those assessments would take into account a wide range of information in cluding measures of labor market conditions indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations and readings on financial and international developments with regard to the postmeeting statement members agreed to update the language of the committees de scription of incoming data to acknowledge that invest ment spending and us exports had remained weak in describing the monetary policy outlook they also agreed to remove the act as appropriate language and empha size that the committee would continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook as it assessed the appropriate path of the target range for the federal funds rate this change was seen as consistent with the view that the current stance of monetary policy was likely to remain appropriate as long as the economy performed broadly in line with the com mittees expectations and that policy was not on a preset course and could change if developments emerged that led to a material reassessment of the economic outlook at the conclusion of the discussion the committee voted to authorize and direct the federal reserve bank of new york until instructed otherwise to execute transactions in the soma in accordance with the fol lowing domestic policy directive to be released at pm effective october the federal open market committee directs the desk to under take open market operations as necessary to maintain the federal funds rate in a target range of to percent in light of recent and ex pected increases in the federal reserves non reserve liabilities the committee directs the desk to purchase treasury bills at least into the second quarter of next year to maintain over time ample reserve balances at or above the level that prevailed in early september the committee also directs the desk to con duct term and overnight repurchase agreement operations at least through january of next year to ensure that the supply of reserves remains ample even during periods of sharp increases in nonreserve liabilities and to mitigate the risk of money market pressures that could adversely af fect policy implementation in addition the committee directs the desk to conduct over night reverse repurchase operations and re verse repurchase operations with maturities of more than one day when necessary to accom modate weekend holiday or similar trading conventions at an offering rate of percent in amounts limited only by the value of treasury securities held outright in the system open market account that are available for such op erations and by a percounterparty limit of billion per day the committee directs the desk to continue rolling over at auction all principal payments from the federal reserves holdings of treasury securities and to continue reinvesting all princi pal payments from the federal reserves hold ings of agency debt and agency mortgage backed securities received during each calendar month principal payments from agency debt and agency mortgagebacked securities up to billion per month will continue to be rein vested in treasury securities to roughly match the maturity composition of treasury securities outstanding principal payments in excess of billion per month will continue to be rein vested in agency mortgagebacked securities small deviations from these amounts for oper ational reasons are acceptable the committee also directs the desk to engage in dollar roll and coupon swap transactions as necessary to facilitate settlement of the federal reserves agency mortgagebacked securities transactions the vote also encompassed approval of the statement below to be released at pm page federal open market committee information received since the federal open market committee met in september indicates that the labor market remains strong and that economic activity has been rising at a moderate rate job gains have been solid on average in recent months and the unemployment rate has remained low although household spending has been rising at a strong pace business fixed investment and exports remain weak on a month basis overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy are run ning below percent marketbased measures of inflation compensation remain low survey based measures of longerterm inflation expec tations are little changed consistent with its statutory mandate the com mittee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability in light of the implications of global developments for the economic out look as well as muted inflation pressures the committee decided to lower the target range for the federal funds rate to to percent this action supports the committees view that sustained expansion of economic activity strong labor market conditions and inflation near the committees symmetric percent ob jective are the most likely outcomes but uncer tainties about this outlook remain the com mittee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic out look as it assesses the appropriate path of the target range for the federal funds rate in determining the timing and size of future ad justments to the target range for the federal funds rate the committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its maximum employment objective and its sym metric percent inflation objective this as sessment will take into account a wide range of information including measures of labor mar ket conditions indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations and readings on fi nancial and international developments voting for this action jerome h powell john c williams michelle w bowman lael brainard james bullard richard h clarida charles l evans and randal k quarles voting against this action esther l george and eric rosengren president george dissented at this meeting because she believed that an unchanged setting of monetary policy was appropriate based on incoming data and the outlook for economic activity over the medium term recogniz ing risks to the outlook from the effects of trade devel opments and weaker global activity president george would be prepared to adjust policy should incoming data point to a materially weaker outlook for the economy president rosengren dissented because he judged that monetary policy was already accommodative and that additional accommodation was not needed for an econ omy in which labor markets are very tight he judged that providing additional accommodation posed risks of further inflating the prices of risky assets and encourag ing households and firms to take on too much leverage consistent with the committees decision to lower the target range for the federal funds rate to to per cent the board of governors voted unanimously to lower the interest rate paid on required and excess re serve balances to percent and voted unanimously to approve a percentage point decrease in the primary credit rate to percent effective october it was agreed that the next meeting of the committee would be held on tuesdaywednesday december the meeting adjourned at am on octo ber notation vote by notation vote completed on october the committee unanimously approved the minutes of the committee meeting held on september videoconference meeting of october the committee met by videoconference on october to review developments in money markets and to discuss steps the committee could take to facilitate effi cient and effective implementation of monetary policy the staff reviewed recent developments in money mar kets and the effect of the desks continued offering of overnight and term repo operations staff analysis and market commentary suggested that many factors con tributed to the funding stresses that emerged in midsep tember in particular financial institutions internal risk limits and balance sheet costs may have slowed the dis tribution of liquidity across the system at a time when reserves had dropped sharply and treasury issuance was elevated although money market conditions had since improved market participants expressed uncertainty about how funding market conditions may evolve over coming months especially around yearend further minutes of the meeting of october page out the april tax season with associated reduc tions in reserves around that time was viewed as another point at which money market pressures could emerge the manager pro tem reviewed options that the com mittee could consider to boost the level of reserves in the banking system and to address temporary money market pressures that could adversely affect monetary policy implementation these options included a pro gram of treasury bill purchases coupled with overnight and term repo operations to maintain reserves at or above their early september level during their discussion all fomc participants agreed that control over the federal funds rate was a priority and that recent money market developments suggested it was appropriate to consider steps at this time to maintain a level of reserves consistent with the committees cho sen amplereserves regime given the projected decline in reserves around yearend and in the spring of they judged that it was important to reach consensus soon on a nearterm plan and associated communica tions all participants expressed support for a plan to purchase treasury bills into the second quarter of and to continue conducting overnight and term repo opera tions at least through january of next year many partic ipants supported conducting operations to maintain re serve balances around the level that prevailed in early september some others suggested moving to an even higher level of reserves to provide an extra buffer and greater assurance of control over the federal funds rate in discussing the pace of treasury bill purchases many participants supported a relatively rapid pace to boost reserve levels quickly while others supported a more moderate pace of purchases participants generally judged that treasury bill purchases and the associated increase in reserves would over time result in a gradual reduction in the need for repo operations a few partic ipants indicated that purchasing treasury notes and bonds with limited remaining maturities could also be considered as a way to boost reserves particularly if the federal reserve faced constraints on the pace at which it could purchase treasury bills participants generally acknowledged some uncertainty over the efficient and effective level of reserves and noted it would be prudent to continue to monitor money market developments and stand ready to adjust the plan as necessary overall par ticipants agreed that the pace of purchases as well as the parameters of the repo operations were technical details of monetary policy implementation not intended to af fect the stance of monetary policy and should be com municated as such most participants preferred not to wait until the octo ber fomc meeting to issue a public statement regarding the planned treasury bill purchases and repo operations they noted that releasing a statement before the october fomc meeting would help rein force the point that these actions were technical and not intended to affect the stance of policy in addition a few participants remarked that an earlier release would allow the desk to begin boosting the level of reserves sooner a couple of participants however wanted to wait until the october fomc meeting to announce the plan so as not to surprise market participants or lead them to infer that the committee regarded the situation as dire and thus requiring immediate action the chair proposed having the staff produce a draft statement that the committee could comment on early in the following week formal approval could occur by notation vote with an anticipated release of a statement to the public on october participants discussed longerterm issues that the com mittee might want to study once the nearterm plan was in place in particular many participants mentioned that the committee may want to continue its previous dis cussion of a standing repo facility as a part of the long run implementation framework almost all of these par ticipants noted that such a facility was an option to pro vide a backstop to buffer shocks that could adversely af fect policy implementation and several of these partici pants mentioned the potential for the facility to support banks liquidity risk management while reducing the de mand for reserves other participants instead high lighted that policy implementation had worked well with larger quantities of reserves and focused their discussion on actions to firmly establish an ample supply of reserves over the longer run a number of participants noted that a discussion of a broader range of factors that affect the level and volatility of reserves may be appropriate at a future meeting on october the committee approved by no tation vote the following statement that outlines steps to ensure that the supply of reserves remains ample so that control over the level of the federal funds rate and other shortterm interest rates is exercised primarily through the setting of the federal reserves administered rates and in which active management of the supply of re serves is not required page federal open market committee statement regarding monetary pol icy implementation adopted october consistent with its january statement regarding monetary policy implementation and balance sheet normalization the committee reaffirms its intention to implement monetary policy in a regime in which an am ple supply of reserves ensures that control over the level of the federal funds rate and other shortterm interest rates is exercised primarily through the setting of the federal reserves administered rates and in which active management of the supply of reserves is not required to ensure that the supply of reserves remains ample the committee approved by notation vote completed on october the following steps in light of recent and expected increases in the fed eral reserves nonreserve liabilities the federal re serve will purchase treasury bills at least into the second quarter of next year in order to maintain over time ample reserve balances at or above the level that prevailed in early september in addition the federal reserve will conduct term and overnight repurchase agreement operations at least through january of next year to ensure that the supply of reserves remains ample even during peri ods of sharp increases in nonreserve liabilities and to mitigate the risk of money market pressures that could adversely affect policy implementation these actions are purely technical measures to support the effective implementation of the fomcs monetary policy and do not represent a change in the stance of monetary policy the committee will continue to mon itor money market developments as it assesses the level of reserves most consistent with efficient and effective policy implementation the committee stands ready to adjust the details of these plans as necessary to foster ef ficient and effective implementation of monetary policy in connection with these plans the federal open market committee voted unanimously to authorize and direct the federal reserve bank of new york until in structed otherwise to execute transactions in the system open

strategy tools and communication practices participants continued to discuss issues related to the ongoing review of the federal reserves monetary policy strategy tools and communication practices the staff summarized the feedback received through the fed lis tens initiative a series of publicfacing events con ducted around the country with a broad range of indi viduals and groups these events engaged with the pub lic directly on issues pertaining to the dualmandate ob jectives of maximum employment and stable prices representatives from underserved communities who participated in the fed listens events generally saw the current strong labor market as providing significant ben efits to their communities most notably by creating attended the discussion of economic developments and the outlook page federal open market committee greater opportunities for individuals who have experi enced difficulty finding jobs in the past nevertheless these representatives noted that the benefits from cur rent labor market conditions flowing to people in their communities were less than those implied by national statistics and they expressed concerns that the recent gains might not be sustained in the event of an economic downturn business representatives reported experienc ing challenges finding qualified workers and described several initiatives to attract and retain workers including training programs and a willingness to employ individu als who are unlikely to have been considered in less fa vorable labor market conditions inflation develop ments elicited fewer comments at these events and were generally seen as posing less of a challenge than labor market conditions representatives of retirees men tioned difficulties associated with the rising costs of health care and prescription drugs whereas those repre senting low and middleincome communities pointed to the rising costs of basic necessities such as housing utilities and food business representatives emphasized the importance of low and stable inflation for planning and decisionmaking event participants were concerned about rising costs of living and generally perceived low inflation as desirable from that perspective event par ticipants were asked about monetary policymakers con cerns regarding overall inflation running persistently be low percent they noted that the federal reserve could better communicate its reasons for these concerns when asked about the effects of changes in interest rates representatives of underserved communities said that such changes had little effect on many members of their communities who have limited or no access to credit representatives of retirees conveyed a more neg ative view of low interest rates given the greater reliance of wealthier retirees on interest income business repre sentatives generally found the low interest rate environ ment beneficial the staff briefing also included an analysis of distribu tional considerations for monetary policy consistent with the feedback received at the fed listens events the evidence reviewed by the staff showed that workers who are young less educated african american or hispanic tend to face a greaterthanaverage risk of losing their jobs during recessions the staff used simulations from a specific macroeconomic model to explore how heter ogeneity of households might affect the transmission of economic shocks and changes in monetary policy to the economy the staffs simulations embedded the as sumption that households have limited ability to borrow which makes some households consumption spending more sensitive to changes in income as a result in these simulations downturns lead to larger contractions in aggregate demand than would be the case if all house holds could borrow to support their consumption spending in response to a loss in income the amplifi cation of recessionary shocks was especially large when the monetary policy response was constrained by the ef fective lower bound elb on the policy interest rate overall the analysis suggested that the costs of reces sions as well as the benefits of economic stabilization might be larger than suggested by models that did not account for differences across households regarding their access to credit participants agreed that the fed listens outreach efforts had informed their understanding of the goals and tradeoffs associated with monetary policy and had pro vided highly useful input into their deliberations several participants voiced their desire to continue the conver sations initiated at the fed listens events participants also shared their appreciation of the feedback they re ceive on a regular basis from members of the public in cluding through the federal reserve systems extensive networks of contacts and community outreach efforts a few participants emphasized that policymakers en gagement with the public helps build trust fosters trans parency and reinforces the credibility of the federal re serve participants generally saw the feedback from fed listens events as reinforcing the importance of sustaining the economic expansion so that the effects of a persistently strong job market reach more of those who in the past had experienced difficulty finding employment several participants mentioned that sustaining strong labor mar ket conditions helps workers build skills and cement their attachment to the labor force in a manner that might reduce the scarring effects of future downturns and might increase the maximum sustainable level of employment over the longer run a number of partici pants also emphasized that sustaining strong labor mar ket conditions is helpful for meeting the committees symmetric percent inflation goal some participants spoke to some of the challenges asso ciated with assessing the maximum level of employment a few participants noted that aggregate statistics mask significant heterogeneity in labor market outcomes a few others pointed to the continued absence of signifi cant wage and price pressuretraditionally seen as a symptom of a tight labor marketeven as the unem ployment rate had moved below most estimates of its longerrun level a few participants raised the possibility that the maximum sustainable level of employment had minutes of the meeting of december page increased as the expansion continued to draw workers who would otherwise not be in the labor force regarding inflation participants recognized that seg ments of the public generally do not regard the fact that aggregate inflation is running modestly below the com mittees percent goal as a problem a few participants noted that the publics view on this issue was under standable from the perspective of households and busi nesses going about their daily lives in an economy with low and stable inflation that said a couple of partici pants cautioned that inflation could emerge as a concern among members of the public if it became more volatile or ran at levels substantially away from the committees goal many participants also warned about the macro economic consequences of not achieving percent on a sustained basis in particular if inflation ran persistently below the committees objective longerterm inflation expectations could drift down resulting in lower actual inflation with lower inflation nominal interest rates would be lower as well and therefore closer to the elb as a result the scope for monetary policy to support the economy in a future downturn through interest rate cuts would be reduced a situation that would likely worsen economic outcomes for households and businesses in light of these considerations participants generally agreed that they need to communicate more clearly to the public their rationale for and commitment to achieving percent inflation on a sustained basis and of ensuring that longerrun inflation expectations are an chored at levels consistent with this objective to ensure the effectiveness of these and other communications several participants stressed that the federal reserve needs to adapt its communications to various audiences a few participants emphasized that communications about the committees resolve to return inflation to percent need to be backed with actions and results to ensure that the public sees these communications as credible with respect to the role of distributional considerations in the pursuit of the dualmandate objectives several participants noted that it was important for policymakers to be cognizant of how monetary policy affects different segments of the population most participants com mented on the large costs that recessions and high un employment impose on communities notably on their most vulnerable constituents and stressed the need for monetary policy to seek to avoid recessions in the first place or reduce their severity when they occur a num ber of these participants emphasized that while mone tary policy actions can have different effects across groups monetary policy actions that are driven by the pursuit of maximum employment and stable prices ulti mately benefit all groups participants viewed the role of monetary policy as supporting a strong stable econ omy that benefits all americans various participants noted that monetary policy is a blunt instrument whose effects cannot be targeted to specific communities sev eral participants remarked that while monetary policy ac tions can improve the conditions of vulnerable commu nities notably by supporting a strong job market these actions may not reduce inequality in wealth and income for these and other reasons many participants empha sized that policies other than monetary policy are appro priate to directly address inequality in addition a couple of participants cautioned that maintaining accommoda tive financial conditions could be counterproductive if doing so fueled financial imbalances and exacerbated the next economic downturn participants agreed that their review of monetary policy strategy tools and communication practices would con tinue at future meetings and as a result that the com mittee would not reaffirm its existing statement on longerrun goals and monetary policy strategy at the january meeting the committee plans to revisit this statement closer to the conclusion of the review likely around the middle of developments in financial markets and open mar ket operations the system open market account manager first re viewed developments in financial markets over the inter meeting period market prices appeared to respond mainly to signs of stabilization in the us and global economies and to developments associated with trade policy market participants noted some risks to the out look including brexit and geopolitical factors regarding expectations for us monetary policy the open market trading desks surveys and marketbased indicators pointed to a very high perceived likelihood of no change in the target range for the federal funds rate at this meeting the expected path of the federal funds rate implied by the medians of survey respondents modal forecasts remained essentially flat through survey and marketimplied uncertainty about the near term outlook for monetary policy declined with market commentary attributing the decrease in part to the com mittees october communications survey respondents placed a higher probability on a reduction in the target range over than an increase the manager turned next to a review of money market developments since the october meeting starting with an update on the implementation of the committees page federal open market committee strategy to ensure ample reserves reserve management purchases of treasury bills continued at a pace of billion per month with propositions remaining strong and little discernible effect on market function ing while these purchases accumulated the desk con tinued to conduct regular repurchase agreement repo operations in order to maintain reserves at or above the level that prevailed in early september repos outstand ing from these desk operations totaled roughly bil lion per day consisting of both overnight and term op erations as reserve levels increased the distribution of reserves across bank types became comparable with where it was in early september the federal funds rate and other overnight money market rates fell modestly and were close to the interest on excess reserves ioer rate for most of the period the intraday dispersion of rates was also lower than when reserves were at similar levels be fore september in addition to helping keep reserves ample repo operations likely have reduced pressures in money markets and the dispersion in money market rates with respect to conditions around yearend the man ager noted that forward measures of market pricing con tinued to indicate expectations of temporary upward pressures on some secured rates money market rates are often volatile around yearend and federal reserve operations are not intended to eliminate all yearend pressures but rather to ensure that reserve supply re mains ample and to mitigate the risk that such pressures could adversely affect the implementation of monetary policy the desk had already conducted three longer term repo operations spanning yearendfor a total of billionand planned to announce an additional longerterm operation as well as increase the amount of overnight repo offered around the yearend date the manager reported that the desk is closely monitoring re serves and money market conditions and that it is pre pared to adjust plans as needed the manager discussed two operational considerations around policy implementation the first involved the risk that future treasury bill purchases could have a larger effect on liquidity in the treasury bill market in light of expected seasonal declines in bill issuance and the federal reserves growing ownership share of out standing bills if this risk were to materialize the federal reserve could consider expanding the universe of secu rities purchased for reserve management purposes to in clude couponbearing treasury securities with a short time to maturity purchases of these shortdated securi ties would not affect broader financial conditions or the stance of monetary policy the manager also discussed expectations to gradually transition away from active repo operations next year as treasury bill purchases sup ply a larger base of reserves the calendar of repo oper ations starting in midjanuary could reflect a gradual re duction in active repo operations the manager indi cated that some repos might be needed at least through april when tax payments will sharply reduce reserve lev els as reserves remain ample the manager noted that it may become appropriate at some point to implement a tech nical adjustment to the ioer rate and the offered rate on overnight reverse repurchase on rrp agreements should conditions warrant this adjustment the ioer rate could move closer to the middle of the target range for the federal funds rate and the on rrp rate could be realigned with the bottom of the target range the manager also noted that the federal reserve bank of new york communicated to its customers that the remuneration rate on the foreign repo pool will be re vised to be generally equivalent to the overnight reverse repo rate this action may reduce activity in the pool to some extent and increase the level of reserves by unanimous vote the committee ratified the desks domestic transactions over the intermeeting period there were no intervention operations in foreign curren cies for the systems account during the intermeeting pe riod staff review

growth slowed further in the third quarter amid continued weakness in the global manufac turing sector recent monthly indicators pointed to a stabilization in the pace of economic growth in china and

strong through oc tober as spreads stabilized at levels that were somewhat above their postcrisis averages staff economic outlook the projection for us real gdp growth prepared by the staff for the december fomc meeting was revised up a little for the second half of relative to the pre vious projection this revision primarily reflected in coming data for household spending and business in vestment that were somewhat stronger than expected even with this upward revision real gdp was forecast to rise more slowly in the second half of the year than in the first half mostly because of continued soft business investment and slower increases in government spend ing the forecast for real gdp growth over the medium term was also revised up a bit on balance primarily in response to a somewhat higher projected path for equity prices nevertheless real gdp growth was still ex pected to slow modestly in the coming years largely be cause of a fading boost from fiscal policy output was forecast to expand at a rate a little above the staffs esti mate of its potential rate of growth in through and then to slow to a pace slightly below potential output growth in the unemployment rate was projected to be roughly flat at around its current level through and to remain below the staffs estimate of its longerrun natural rate the staffs forecast for total pce price inflation in was revised down a bit as a downward revision to core pce prices in response to recent data was partly offset by an upward revision to consumer energy prices be yond core inflation was expected to be above its pace this year and this projection was revised up a touch because of the slightly tighter resource utilization in the current forecast the projection for total inflation in was a little lower than for core inflation due to a projected decline in consumer energy prices over the remainder of the mediumterm projection total inflation was expected to be about the same as core inflation al though both inflation measures were forecast to con tinue to run a bit below percent through the staff continued to view the uncertainty around its projections for real gdp growth the unemployment rate and inflation as generally similar to the average of the past years the staff viewed the downside risks to economic activity as having eased a bit since the pre vious forecast but still judged that the risks to the fore cast for real gdp growth were tilted to the downside with a corresponding skew to the upside for the unem ployment rate important factors influencing this assess ment were that international trade tensions and foreign economic developments seemed more likely to move in directions that could have significant negative effects on the us economy than to resolve more favorably than assumed in addition softness in business investment and manufacturing production so far this year were seen as pointing to the possibility of a more substantial slow ing in economic growth than the staff projected the risks to the inflation projection were also viewed as hav ing a downward skew in part because of the downside risks to the forecast for economic activity participants views on current conditions and the economic outlook in conjunction with this fomc meeting members of the board of governors and federal reserve bank pres idents submitted their projections of the most likely out comes for real gdp growth the unemployment rate and inflation for each year from through and over the longer run based on their individual assess ments of the appropriate path for the federal funds rate the longerrun projections represented each partici pants assessment of the rate to which each variable would be expected to converge over time under appro priate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy these projections are described page federal open market committee in the summary of economic projections sep which is an addendum to these minutes participants agreed that the labor market had remained strong over the intermeeting period and that economic activity had risen at a moderate rate job gains had been solid on average in recent months and the unemploy ment rate had remained low although household spending had risen at a strong pace business fixed in vestment and exports had remained weak on a month basis overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy were running below per cent marketbased measures of inflation compensation remained low surveybased measures of longerterm in flation expectations were little changed participants generally expected sustained expansion of economic activity strong labor market conditions and inflation near the committees symmetric percent ob jective as the most likely outcomes this outlook re flected at least in part the support provided by the cur rent stance of monetary policy nevertheless global de velopments related to both persistent uncertainty re garding international trade and weakness in economic growth abroad continued to pose some risks to the out look and inflation pressures remained muted in their discussion of the household sector participants agreed that spending had increased at a strong pace they generally expected that consumption spending would likely remain on a firm footing supported by strong labor market conditions rising incomes and solid consumer confidence in addition residential invest ment had continued to pick up reflecting in part the effects of lower mortgage rates many participants com mented that business contacts in consumerrelated in dustries reported strong demand or that contacts were optimistic about the holiday retail spending season however some participants observed that recent data on retail sales or motor vehicle spending had decelerated slightly with respect to the business sector participants saw trade developments and concerns about the global eco nomic growth outlook as the main factors contributing to weak business investment and exports participants generally expected these factors to continue to damp business investment and exports they expressed simi lar concerns about activity in manufacturing industries a few participants noted that the current weakness in capital expenditures could lead to a slower pace of productivity growth in future years a few others ob served that businesses were diversifying their supply chains or investing in technology to adapt to persistent uncertainty regarding international trade which might mitigate the effects of such uncertainty on future busi ness spending a number of participants commented on challenges fac ing the energy and agriculture sectors a few partici pants remarked that activity in the energy sector was es pecially weak reflecting low petroleum prices low prof itability and tight financing conditions for energy producing firms several participants noted that the ag ricultural sector also faced a number of difficulties in cluding those associated with trade developments weak export demand and challenging financial positions for many farmers a couple of participants noted that farm subsidies from the federal government were offsetting a portion of the financial strain on farmers participants judged that conditions in the labor market remained strong with the unemployment rate at a year low job gains remaining solid and some measures of labor force participation increasing further the unemployment rate was likely to remain low going forward and various participants remarked that there were some indications that further strengthening in overall labor market conditions was possible without creating undesirable pressures on resources in particu lar a number of participants noted that the labor force participation rate could rise further still moreover measures of wage growth had generally remained mod erate however a few participants commented that in creases in the labor force would likely moderate as slack in the labor market diminished in addition a couple of participants remarked that the preliminary benchmark revision released in august by the bureau of labor sta tistics had indicated that payroll employment gains would likely show less momentum coming into this year once those revisions are incorporated in published data early next year a couple of other participants thought it was important to better understand the quality of jobs being created business contacts in many districts indi cated continued strong labor demand with firms report ing difficulties in finding qualified workers or broaden ing their recruiting to include traditionally marginalized groups a number of participants noted that wage pres sures were evident for some industries in their districts and a couple of participants commented that firms were responding to those pressures in a variety of ways in cluding investing in technology that could serve as a sub stitute for labor in their discussion of inflation developments partici pants noted that recent readings on overall and core pce inflation measured on a month change basis had continued to run below percent surveybased minutes of the meeting of december page measures of longerterm inflation expectations were lit tle changed and marketbased measures of inflation compensation remained low a few participants com mented on factors that may temporarily exert upward pressure on some measures of inflation in the coming months assessing all these factors participants gener ally expected that inflation would return to the percent objective as the economic expansion continued and re source utilization remained high however weakness abroad and subdued global inflation pressures were cited as sources of risk to this assessment participants who expressed less confidence that inflation would return promptly to the percent objective commented that in flation had averaged less than percent over the past several years even as resource utilization had increased or that global or technologyrelated factors were exerting downward pressure on inflation that could be difficult to overcome participants also discussed risks regarding the outlook for economic activity while many saw the risks as tilted somewhat to the downside some risks were seen to have eased over recent months in particular there were some tentative signs that trade tensions with china were easing and the probability of a nodeal brexit was judged to have lessened further in addition there were indica tions that the prospects for global economic growth may be stabilizing a number of participants observed that the domestic economy was showing resilience in the face of headwinds from global developments moreover sta tistical models designed to gauge the probability of re cession using financial market data including those based on information from the treasury yield curve suggested that the likelihood of a recession occurring over the medium term had fallen noticeably in recent months however new uncertainties had emerged re garding trade policy with argentina brazil and france and political tensions in hong kong persisted in their consideration of monetary policy at this meeting participants judged that it would be appropriate to main tain the target range for the federal funds rate at to percent to support sustained expansion of economic activity strong labor market conditions and inflation near the committees symmetric percent objective as reflected in their sep projections participants regarded the current stance of monetary policy as likely to remain appropriate for a time as long as incoming information about the economy remained broadly consistent with the economic outlook of course if developments emerged that led to a material reassessment of the outlook the stance of policy would need to adjust in a way that fos tered the committees dualmandate objectives a number of participants agreed that maintaining the current stance of monetary policy would give the com mittee some time to assess the full effects on the econ omy of its policy decisions and communications over the course of this year along with other information bearing on the economic outlook participants also discussed how maintaining the current stance of policy for a time could be helpful for cushioning the economy from the global developments that have been weighing on eco nomic activity and for returning inflation to the com mittees symmetric objective of percent participants generally expressed concerns regarding inflation contin uing to fall short of percent although a number of participants noted that some of the factors currently holding down inflation were likely to prove transitory various participants were concerned that indicators were suggesting that the level of longerterm inflation expec tations was too low a few participants raised the concern that keeping inter est rates low over a long period might encourage exces sive risktaking which could exacerbate imbalances in the financial sector these participants offered various perspectives on the relationship between financial stabil ity and policies that keep interest rates persistently low they remarked that such policies could be inconsistent with sustaining maximum employment could make the next recession more severe than otherwise or could strengthen the case for the active use of macroprudential tools to guard against emerging imbalances various participants remarked on issues related to the implementation of monetary policy highlighting topics for further discussion at future meetings among the topics mentioned were the potential role of a standing repo facility in an amplereserves regime the setting of administered rates and the composition of the federal reserves holdings of treasury securities over the longer run committee policy action in their discussion of monetary policy for this meeting members noted that information received since the fomc met in october indicated that the labor market remained strong and that economic activity had been ris ing at a moderate rate job gains had been solid on av erage in recent months and the unemployment rate had remained low although household spending had been rising at a strong pace business fixed investment and ex ports remained weak on a month basis overall in flation and inflation for items other than food and en ergy were running below percent marketbased measures of inflation compensation

committees symmetric percent objective members also agreed that in determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the fed eral funds rate the committee would assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its maximum employment objective and its symmetric percent infla tion objective and they concurred that this assessment would take into account a wide range of information in cluding measures of labor market conditions indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations and readings on financial and international developments with regard to the postmeeting statement members agreed to state that they judged that the current stance of monetary policy is appropriate to support the achievement of the committees policy objectives members discussed their options regarding references to global developments and muted inflation pressures in the statement in their judgment these factors cited in previous postmeeting statements as part of the rationale for adjusting the stance of policy remained salient fea tures of the outlook accordingly they agreed to cite them in the sentence indicating that the committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming infor mation for the economic outlook with the retention of these references to global developments and muted inflation pressures members agreed that the text on un certainties about the outlook could be removed a few members suggested that the language stating that mone tary policy would support inflation near percent could be misinterpreted as suggesting that policymakers were comfortable with inflation running below that level they preferred language that referred to returning inflation to the committees symmetric percent objec tive other members thought that the reference to near percent was intended to encompass modest de viations of inflation above and below percent at the conclusion of the discussion the committee voted to authorize and

participants may see in their economic projections participants assess ments of the balance of risks to their current economic projections are shown in the bottomright panels of fig ures a b and c relative to the september sep more participants saw the risks to the outlook for real gdp growth and the unemployment rate as broadly bal anced although a small majority continued to view the risks to their outlooks for real gdp growth as weighted to the downside and for the unemployment rate as weighted to the upside most participants continued to judge the risks to their inflation outlook as broadly bal anced while some participants viewed the risks to their inflation outlook as weighted to the downside no par ticipant assessed the risks to his or her inflation outlook as weighted to the upside in discussing the uncertainty and risks surrounding their economic projections some participants mentioned trade developments and concerns about foreign eco nomic growth as sources of uncertainty or downside risk to the us economic growth outlook in contrast the underlying strength of both consumer spending and the labor market was cited as balancing the risks around the growth outlook in addition most of the participants who shifted their balance of risks for output growth to broadly balanced cited more accommodative mone tary policy as a contributing factor for the inflation out look the possibility that inflation expectations could be drifting below levels consistent with the fomcs per cent inflation objective was viewed as a downside risk a couple of participants mentioned higher tariffs as a source of upside risk to their inflation outlook participants assessments of the appropriate future path of the federal funds rate are also subject to

projected values is based on root mean squared errors of various private and government forecasts made over the previous years the condence interval is not strictly consistent with the projections for the federal funds rate primarily because these projections are not forecasts of the likeliest outcomes for the federal funds rate but rather projections of participants individual assessments of appropriate monetary policy still historical forecast errors provide a broad sense of the uncertainty around the future path of the federal funds rate generated by the uncertainty about the macroeconomic variables as well as additional adjustments to monetary policy that may be appropriate to onset the eects of shocks to the economy the condence interval is assumed to be symmetric except when it is truncated at zero the bottom of the lowest target range for the federal funds rate that has been adopted in the past by the committee this truncation would not be intended to indicate the likelihood of the use of negative interest rates to provide additional monetary policy accommodation if doing so was judged appropriate in such situations the committee could also employ other tools including forward guidance and largescale asset purchases to provide additional accommodation because current conditions may dier from those that prevailed on average over the previous years the width

shaded area encompasses less than a percent condence interval if the condence interval has been truncated at zero summary of economic projections of the meeting of december page forecast uncertainty the economic projections provided by the members of the board of governors and the presidents of the federal reserve banks inform discussions of monetary policy among policymakers and can aid public understanding of the basis for policy actions considerable uncertainty attends these projections however the economic and statistical models and relationships used to help produce economic forecasts are necessarily imperfect descriptions of the real world and the future path of the economy can be affected by myriad unforeseen developments and events thus in setting the stance of monetary policy participants consider not only what appears to be the most likely economic outcome as em bodied in their projections but also the range of alternative possibilities the likelihood of their occurring and the poten tial costs to the economy should they occur table summarizes the average historical accuracy of a range of forecasts including those reported in past monetary policy reports and those prepared by the federal reserve boards staff in advance of meetings of the federal open market committee fomc the projection error ranges shown in the table illustrate the considerable uncertainty as sociated with economic forecasts for example suppose a participant projects that real gross domestic product gdp and total consumer prices will rise steadily at annual rates of respectively percent and percent if the uncertainty at tending those projections is similar to that experienced in the past and the risks around the projections are broadly bal anced the numbers reported in table would imply a prob ability of about percent that actual gdp would expand within a range of to percent in the current year to percent in the second year and to percent in the third and fourth years the corresponding percent con fidence intervals for overall inflation would be to per cent in the current year to percent in the second year to percent in the third year and to percent in the fourth year figures a through c illustrate these con fidence bounds in fan charts that are symmetric and cen tered on the medians of fomc participants projections for gdp growth the unemployment rate and inflation how ever in some instances the risks around the projections may not be symmetric in particular the unemployment rate can not be negative furthermore the risks around a particular projection might be tilted to either the upside or the down side in which case the corresponding fan chart would be asymmetrically positioned around the median projection because current conditions may differ from those that prevailed on average over history participants provide judgments as to whether the uncertainty attached to their projections of each economic variable is greater than smaller than or broadly similar to typical levels of forecast uncer tainty seen in the past years as presented in table and reflected in the widths of the confidence intervals shown in the top panels of figures a through c participants cur rent assessments of the uncertainty surrounding their projec tions are summarized in the bottomleft panels of those fig ures participants also provide judgments as to whether the risks to their projections are weighted to the upside are weighted to the downside or are broadly balanced that is while the symmetric historical fan charts shown in the top panels of figures a through c imply that the risks to par ticipants projections are balanced participants may judge that there is a greater risk that a given variable will be above rather than below their projections these judgments are summa rized in the lowerright panels of figures a through c as with real activity and inflation the outlook for the future path of the federal funds rate is subject to considerable uncertainty this uncertainty arises primarily because each participants assessment of the appropriate stance of mone tary policy depends importantly on the evolution of real ac tivity and inflation over time if economic conditions evolve in an unexpected manner then assessments of the appropri ate setting of the federal funds rate would change from that point forward the final line in table shows the error ranges for forecasts of shortterm interest rates they suggest that the historical confidence intervals associated with projections of the federal funds rate are quite wide it should be noted however that these confidence intervals are not strictly con sistent with the projections for the federal funds rate as these projections are not forecasts of the most likely quarterly out comes but rather are projections of participants individual as sessments of appropriate monetary policy and are on an end ofyear basis however the forecast errors should provide a sense of the uncertainty around the future path of the federal funds rate generated by the uncertainty about the macroeco nomic variables as well as additional adjustments to monetary policy that would be appropriate to offset the effects of shocks to the economy if at some point in the future the confidence interval around the federal funds rate were to extend below zero it would be truncated at zero for purposes of the fan chart shown in figure zero is the bottom of the lowest target range for the federal funds rate that has been adopted by the committee in the past this approach to the construction of the federal funds rate fan chart would be merely a convention it would not have any implications for possible future policy decisions regarding the use of negative interest rates to pro vide additional monetary policy accommodation if doing so were appropriate in such situations the committee could also employ other tools including forward guidance and asset purchases to provide additional accommodation while figures a through c provide information on the uncertainty around the economic projections figure provides information on the range of views across fomc participants a comparison of figure with figures a through c shows that the dispersion of the projections across participants is much smaller than the average forecast errors over the past years page federal open

provided approval for the publication of a federal register notice of proposed rulemaking that seeks public comment on minor and technical updates to the fomc rules regarding avail ability of information which are the committees free dom of information act rules review of monetary policy strategy tools and communication practices participants continued their discussion related to the on going review of the federal reserves monetary policy strategy tools and communication practices at this meeting the discussion focused on two topics the po tential interactions between monetary policy and finan cial stability and the potential use of inflation ranges around the committees percent inflation objective the staff briefing on the first topic noted that in the cur rent environment of low neutral rates achieving the committees dualmandate goals of maximum employ ment and price stability would require low policy rates frequently regardless of the monetary policy strategy and tools chosen consequently policy strategies and tools that help support a stronger economy and anchor inflation expectations at a level consistent with the com mittees objective in a lowneutralrate environment can help promote financial stability in addition the staff reported that the available empirical evidence suggests that the effects of changes in policy rates on asset prices and risk premiums tend to be modest relative to the his torical fluctuations in those measures however there may be circumstances in which a persistently accommo dative policy stance that is otherwise consistent with the dualmandate goals may contribute to an increase in fi nancial system vulnerabilities including through in creased borrowing financial leverage and valuation pressures the staff noted that clear communications of page federal open market committee the committees ongoing assessments of the interac tions between monetary policy and financial stability could help avoid large interest rate surprises that could otherwise contribute to financial vulnerabilities the briefing concluded with a short review of how other cen tral banks have approached this issue including the use of financial instability escape clauses to provide leeway for the central bank to deviate from its usual monetary policy strategy if financial vulnerabilities become signifi cant in their discussion of the effects that alternative mone tary policy strategies and tools might have on financial stability participants noted that macroeconomic stability and the achievement of the committees dual mandate depended on a stable financial system an unstable fi nancial system may amplify shocks to the economy and exacerbate increases in unemployment or drive inflation further away from the committees goal with respect to the relationship between monetary policy and finan cial stability some participants noted that evidence re garding the link between the policy stance and elevated financial vulnerabilities was limited with a couple of par ticipants further observing that there were not many ep isodes of persistently low interest rates in addition some past episodes of heightened financial vulnerabili ties were associated with excessive risktaking behavior that did not seem to be very responsive to typical changes in interest rates a number of participants judged that under some circumstances low policy rates might help foster financial stability provided they are needed to support strong economic conditions and price stability some participants remarked however that keeping policy rates low to achieve both of the commit tees dualmandate objectives may contribute to a buildup of financial vulnerabilities especially at times when the economy is at or above full employment a de velopment that could pose future risks to the economy and to the ability of the committee to achieve its dual mandate participants discussed how financial stability considera tions should be incorporated in the conduct of monetary policy they generally agreed that supervisory regula tory and macroprudential tools should be the primary means to address financial stability risks a few partici pants commented that this is especially the case when addressing risks associated with structural features such as the current low level of neutral interest rates a num ber of participants noted that countercyclical macropru dential tools such as the countercyclical capital buffer could be used to address cyclical financial stability risks however various participants noted that while these tools could be deployed proactively to lean against the buildup of financial vulnerabilities they have some limi tations in the context of the us financial system where the few available tools are for the most part not de signed to address vulnerabilities outside the banking sec tor in addition these tools are not within the authority of the committee and their use requires coordination with other prudential regulators recognizing these lim itations many participants remarked that the committee should not rule out the possibility of adjusting the stance of monetary policy to mitigate financial stability risks particularly when those risks have important implica tions for the economic outlook and when macropruden tial tools had been or were likely to be ineffective at mit igating those risks nevertheless many participants noted that the current knowledge of the interactions be tween the stance of monetary policy and financial vul nerabilities is too imprecise to warrant systematically ad justing monetary policy in response to the evolution of financial stability risks as a result monetary policy should be guided primarily by the outlook for employ ment and inflation and it should respond to financial stability risks only insofar as such risks significantly threaten the achievement of the committees mandate several participants observed that the monetary policy measures needed to curb financial stability risks could be quite large and the resulting effects on employment and inflation could place a high hurdle for such measures some participants remarked that because financial sta bility risks are a consideration for achieving the commit tees dual mandate a clear communications strategy would be needed to convey the committees assess ments of financial vulnerabilities and their potential im plications for the monetary policy outlook several par ticipants noted that a communications strategy could in clude the possible use of financial instability escape clauses to help explain the rationale for policy actions when a buildup of financial vulnerabilities poses risks to the achievement of the committees goals the staffs briefing on considerations regarding the use of an inflation range focused on three different concepts of an inflation range first an uncertainty range could communicate the magnitude of the inherent variability of inflation that would still be consistent with achieving the committees symmetric inflation objective second an operational range could signal that under some condi tions the committee would prefer inflation to be away from its longerrun objective for a time such a range could potentially be used as part of a makeup policy strategy including one based on average inflation target ing or in other strategies aimed at offsetting the adverse minutes of the meeting of january page effects of a binding effective lower bound on policy rates third an indifference range could communicate that monetary policy would not respond to deviations of in flation within that range the briefing also summarized the experiences of foreign central banks that use infla tion ranges these ranges were typically put in place many years ago often in conjunction with adopting an infla tion target the staff highlighted the communications challenges that could arise if an inflation range were in troduced at a time when inflation had been running be low the central banks objective for a number of years in this environment the introduction of a symmetric range around the point objective could be misinter preted as a sign that the central bank was not concerned about inflation remaining below its stated goal a situa tion that could lead to inflation expectations drifting down to the lower end of the range participants expressed a range of views on the potential benefits and costs of different types of inflation ranges most participants expressed concern that introducing a symmetric inflation range around the percent objective following an extended period of inflation mostly running somewhat below percent could be misperceived as a signal that the committee was comfortable with contin ued misses below its symmetric inflation objective many participants agreed that an uncertainty range could be misinterpreted as an indifference range and hence as a lack of commitment by the committee to its symmet ric percent inflation objective some participants sug gested that it was not clear that introducing a range would help much in achieving the committees inflation objective they noted that introducing a range could make that objective less clear to the public instead of establishing a range the committee could continue to communicate that its inflation objective was symmetric around percent while inflation is inherently variable the committee then could emphasize its intention for inflation to be centered on the percent objective nev ertheless in view of the inherent variability of inflation several participants judged that there could be some ben efit in communicating the inflation objective with a sym metric range around the point target in addition a few participants suggested that an inflation range could con vey the uncertainty associated with the available array of inflation measures or that the committees communica tions could more explicitly reference other measures of inflation several participants also stated that employing an asymmetric operational range for a timewith per cent being at or near the lower end of that rangewhile still maintaining the longerrun target of percent could help communicate that the committee intended infla tion to average percent over time which in turn could help keep longerrun inflation expectations at levels con sistent with its objective participants expected that at upcoming meetings they would continue their deliberations on the committees review of monetary policy strategy tools and communi cation practices participants continued to anticipate that the review will likely be completed around the mid dle of this year developments in financial markets and open mar ket operations the soma manager reviewed developments in financial markets over the intermeeting period for most of the period risk asset prices rose as market participants fo cused on a perceived reduction in downside risks to the economic outlook favorable data on foreign economic activity and expectations of continued monetary policy accommodation in the united states and other major economies some market participants suggested that the federal reserves actions in the fourth quarter to main tain ample reserve levels might have contributed to some degree to the rise in equity and other risk asset prices over the final few days of the intermeeting period fi nancial markets responded to news of the spread of the coronavirus that started in china which reportedly con tributed to downward moves in treasury yields and to a lesser extent us equity prices on balance us fi nancial conditions became more accommodative over the intermeeting period with equity prices rising nota bly despite signs of reduced risks to the outlook and of some stabilization in economic activity abroad financial market participants views on the likely course of us monetary policy appeared to have changed little over the intermeeting period marketbased indicators continued to point to expectations that the target range for the fed eral funds rate will be lowered by roughly basis points this year this was consistent with responses to the open market desks survey which continued to indi cate that while market participants viewed no change this year in the target range as the most likely outcome they placed a higher probability on a reduction in the target range over the year than on an increase market commentary attributed the stability in federal funds rate expectations despite the perceived reduction in down side risks partly to the committees communications some market participants reportedly regarded those communications as signaling a relatively high bar for changes to the target range in addition results from the page federal open market committee desks surveys suggested that notwithstanding the abatement in some risks over recent months many mar ket participants continued to see risks to the economic outlook as skewed to the downside the manager turned next to a review of money market developments and desk operations the federal funds rate was stable over the yearend date and remained close to the interest on excess reserves ioer rate on going reserve management purchases of treasury bills and the desks repurchase agreement repo operations kept aggregate reserves above the level that prevailed in early september contributing to relatively calm money market conditions around yearend market participants cited funding from the additional longerterm repo op erations spanning yearend and increased capacity in daily operations as helping to maintain stable conditions in shortterm funding markets in addition market par ticipants prepared earlier than usual for yearend with borrowers increasing their term borrowing from private lenders and lenders apparently expanding their lending capacity since yearend money market rates remained stable with the desks longerterm repos maturing with no dis cernible effect on market conditions and reserve man agement purchases of treasury bills proceeding smoothly at the current pace of billion per month the staffs estimates suggested that after april of this year the desks reserve management purchases will re store the permanent base of reserves to levels above those prevailing in early september although re serves are projected to be above trillion before april a surge in the treasury general account balance during the april tax season is expected to briefly reduce reserve levels and in the absence of repo operations bring reserves down temporarily to around trillion the manager discussed a potential plan for gradually transitioning to an operational approach designed to maintain ample reserve levels without the active use of repo operations to supply reserves under this plan repo operations would be maintained at least through april to ensure ample reserve conditions however the desk would continue the gradual reduction and consol idation of its repo offerings ahead of april with the plan of phasing out term repo operations after april as part of this transition the minimum bid rate on repo opera tions could be gradually lifted and the committee could consider whether there is a role for repo operations in the implementation framework in the second quarter the manager expected reserve conditions to support slowing the pace of treasury bill purchases with the goal of eventually aligning growth of the federal reserves treasury holdings with trend growth in its liabilities as that time approaches the committee might wish to consider the appropriate ma turity composition of reserve management purchases of treasury securities the manager noted that although the pace of treasury purchases would likely continue into the second quarter the rate of expansion in the fed eral reserves balance sheet would moderate during the first half of as repo outstanding was gradually re duced the managers briefing addressed the possibility of a small technical adjustment to the federal reserves ad ministered rates in light of the stability in money market conditions over recent months with this adjustment the board would lift the interest rates on required and excess reserves by basis points and the fomc would implement an equalsized upward adjustment to the overnight reverse repurchase agreement offer rate this technical adjustment would reverse the small downward adjustment to administered rates made in september when money markets were volatile by unanimous vote the committee ratified the desks domestic transactions over the intermeeting period no intervention operations occurred in foreign currencies for the systems account during the intermeeting period staff review of the economic situation the information available for the january meeting indicated that labor market conditions remained strong and that real gross domestic product gdp increased at a moderate rate in the fourth quarter of consumer price inflation as measured by the month percentage change in the price index for personal consumption ex penditures pce remained below percent in novem ber surveybased measures of longerrun inflation ex pectations were little changed total nonfarm payroll employment rose in december and the solid pace of job gains over the second half of was somewhat above that for the first half how ever the rate of increase in payrolls in was slower than in whether or not one accounted for the an ticipated effects of the bureau of labor statistics bench mark revision to payroll employment which was sched uled for early february the unemployment rate held steady at its year low of percent in december and the labor force participation rate and the employment

economic reasons in november stayed below its level in late the rate of privatesector job openings declined on net in octo ber and november but was still at a fairly high level the rate of quits which was also at a high level edged up the fourweek moving average of initial claims for un employment insurance benefits through midjanuary re mained near historically low levels nominal wage growth was moderate with average hourly earnings for all employees increasing percent over the months ending in december total consumer prices as measured by the pce price index increased percent over the months

inflation and consumer energy prices declined the trimmed mean measure of month pce price inflation constructed by the federal reserve bank of dallas remained at per cent in november the consumer price index cpi and the core cpi both rose percent over the months ending in december recent readings on surveybased measures of longerrun inflation expectations were little changed on balance in recent months the university of michigan surveys of consumers measure for the next to years moved back up in early january after having fallen to its lowest value on record in december mean while the yearahead measure from the federal re serve bank of new yorks survey of consumer expec tations remained near its historical low in december real pce appeared to have risen more slowly in the fourth quarter than in the third quarter retail sales were soft during the fourth quarter and sales of light motor vehicles declined in december after a strong gain in no vember however key factors that influence consumer spendingincluding the low unemployment rate the upward trend in real disposable income high levels of households net worth and generally low interest rates remained supportive of solid real pce growth in the near term in addition recent readings on consumer confidence from both the university of michigan and the conference board surveys were strong real residential investment appeared to have increased solidly again in the fourth quarter starts for singlefam ily homes increased sharply over the november and de cember period building permit issuance for such homes rose on net and starts of multifamily units also moved up existing home sales increased on balance in no vember and december while new home sales declined all told the data on residential construction and sales continued to suggest that the decline in mortgage rates since late had been boosting housing activity the available data pointed to another decline in real non residential private fixed investment in the fourth quarter with a further contraction in structures investment more than offsetting a modest rise in investment in equipment and intangibles nominal shipments and new orders of nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft were little changed in the fourth quarter although some measures of business sentiment improved analysts expectations of firms longerterm profit growth edged down further concerns about trade developments continued to weigh on firms investment decisions and reduced deliveries of the boeing max were likely restraining investment nominal business expenditures for nonresidential struc tures outside of the drilling and mining sector continued to decline in november the total number of crude oil and natural gas rigs in operationan indicator of busi ness spending for structures in the drilling and mining sectorwas little changed on net through midjanuary though still below levels seen over the latter part of industrial production ip increased on net in novem ber and december partly because of a pickup in motor vehicle production following the strike at general mo tors even so ip was lower than a year earlier with de clines in manufacturing production and the output of utilities only partly offset by an increase in mining out put automakers schedules suggested that assemblies of light motor vehicles would increase in the first quar ter but that gain appeared likely to be offset by boeings curtailed production of the max aircraft and more generally by mixed readings on new orders from na tional and regional manufacturing surveys total real government purchases appeared to have in creased moderately in the fourth quarter nominal de fense spending in november and december pointed to only a moderate rise in real federal government pur chases real purchases by state and local governments looked to have risen a little faster than in the third quar ter nominal construction spending by these govern ments increased solidly in november and state and local payrolls expanded modestly in december real net exports were estimated to have provided a sub stantial boost to real gdp growth in the fourth quarter page federal open market committee available monthly data suggested that imports fell sig nificantly led by declines in consumer goods and auto mobiles while exports were about flat incoming data suggested that foreign economic growth slowed further in the fourth quarter to a very subdued pace in the advanced foreign economies afes growth appeared to have remained weak as the manu facturing slump continued and a consumption tax hike in japan led to a sharp contraction in household spend ing in the emerging economies social unrest weighed heavily on economic activity in hong kong and chile while the labor strike at general motors was a further drag on mexicos already weak economy in contrast early gdp releases showed a pickup in growth in china and some other asian economies though news of the coronavirus outbreak raised questions about the sustain ability of that pickup foreign inflation rose in the wake of temporary factors in india and china while it re mained soft in most afes in part reflecting previous declines in energy prices and muted core inflation pres sures staff review of the financial situation investor sentiment improved on balance over the inter meeting period mostly reflecting progress related to the phaseone trade deal between the united states and china and its subsequent signing the perception that the probability of a disorderly brexit had declined signs of stabilization in the global economic outlook and report edly continued confidence that monetary policy in the united states and other major economies would remain accommodative in the near term late in the period concerns about the spread of the coronavirus and uncer tainty about its potential economic effect weighed nega tively on investor sentiment and led to moderate declines in the prices of risky assets on net equity prices in creased notably over the intermeeting period while cor porate bond spreads were little changed and yields on nominal treasury securities declined financing condi tions for businesses and households eased a bit further and generally remained supportive of spending and eco nomic activity federal reserve communications over the intermeeting period reportedly reinforced investors beliefs that a nearterm change to the target range for the federal funds rate was unlikely consistent with those reports a straight read of the probability distributions for the fed eral funds rate implied by options prices suggested that investors assigned a high probability to the target range remaining unchanged over the next few months

securities was little changed measures of inflation compensation over the next years and to years ahead based on treasury infla tionprotected securities decreased on net but re mained above their october lows broad stock price indexes increased notably on balance over the intermeeting period with gains largely at tributed to improved market sentiment about trade ne gotiations and a perceived lower probability of a disor derly brexit late in the period equity prices retraced some of their gains as concerns about the spread of the coronavirus weighed negatively on risk sentiment overall movements in stock prices varied widely across economic sectors with stocks of firms in the infor mation technology and utilities sectors significantly out performing aggregate indexes while stock prices of firms in the energy sector declined markedly option implied volatility on the sp index increased a bit on balance while corporate credit spreads were little changed conditions in domestic shortterm funding markets in cluding in secured financing were stable over the inter meeting period even over yearend rates declined slightly likely reflecting increased liquidity and a higher level of reserves provided by the desks open market operations the effective federal funds rate remained close to the ioer rate and spreads for term unsecured commercial paper and negotiable certificates of deposit narrowed substantially particularly after yearend the desks open market operations proceeded smoothly for most of the intermeeting period foreign equity prices rose amid progress on uschina trade negotia tions generally favorable data on global economic activ ity and the reduced risk of a disorderly brexit following the uk general election late in the period however concerns about the coronavirus outbreak in china weighed on risk sentiment on balance most major for eign equity indexes increased modestly and afe long term sovereign yields ended the period somewhat lower uk and canadian yields declined more than elsewhere against the backdrop of central bank communications that were interpreted as increasing the likelihood of pol icy easing in those countries minutes of the meeting of january page the broad dollar index weakened slightly over the pe riod predominantly against emerging market currencies the chinese renminbi appreciated notably against the dollar on positive trade policy developments but this gain was more than undone late in the period by con cerns about the coronavirus the mexican peso strengthened against the dollar supported by progress on

in november issuance of speculativegrade bonds over the intermeeting period remained about in line with the average pace over december and january in recent years institutional leveraged loan issuance continued to be robust in december reflecting solid refinancing ac tivity and moderate new money issuance meanwhile commercial and industrial ci loans on banks balance sheets contracted in the fourth quarter respondents to the january senior loan officer opinion survey on bank lending practices sloos reported that bor rower demand weakened for ci loans over the fourth quarter and lending standards on such loans were little changed gross equity issuance through seasoned offer ings remained robust in december while initial public offerings continued to be quite light the credit quality of

commercial real estate cre sector financing conditions also remained generally accommodative the volume of agency and nonagency commercial mort gagebacked securities issuance grew notably in the fourth quarter buoyed by lower interest rates and the growth of cre loans on banks books picked up over this period responses to the january sloos sug gested that lending standards and demand for most cre loan categories were unchanged in the fourth quarter financing conditions in the residential mortgage market remained accommodative on balance mortgage rates decreased notably during the intermeeting period reach ing recentyear lows homepurchase originations re mained around postcrisis highs and mortgage refinanc ing activity continued at a strong pace through decem ber financing conditions in consumer credit markets re mained supportive of growth in consumer spending al though the supply of credit remained relatively tight for nonprime borrowers the growth of credit card bal ances slowed in the fourth quarter and according to the january sloos commercial banks tightened their standards on credit card loans over this period auto loan growth maintained a solid pace in recent months amid declining interest rates through yearend the staff provided an update on its assessments of po tential risks to financial stability on balance the finan cial vulnerabilities of the us financial system were char acterized as moderate the staff judged that asset valu ation pressures had increased in recent months to an el evated level asset valuation pressures were character ized as fairly widespread across a number of markets similar to the situation in much of and in assessing vulnerabilities stemming from borrowing in the household and business sectors the staff noted that while the ratio of household debt to nominal gdp was fairly low the ratio of business debt to nominal gdp was high by historical standards at the same time ma jor financial institutions were viewed as resilient in part because of high levels of capital at banks nonetheless the staff noted that banks had announced that they in tend to allow their capital ratios to decline closer to reg ulatory requirements over the medium term vulnera bilities stemming from funding risk were characterized as moderate while the money market strains in sep tember raised some questions about vulnerabilities in funding markets the staff assessed that the core of the financial system remains resilient to vulnerabilities from maturity and liquidity transformation staff economic outlook the projection for us real gdp growth prepared by the staff for the january fomc meeting was stronger than in the previous forecast data pertaining to the fourth quarter of particularly on imports sug gested output rose faster at the end of the year than was previously projected and this faster pace seemed con sistent with the solid employment gains in the fourth quarter in addition more supportive financial condi tions and the anticipated effects of the phaseone trade deal between the united states and china pushed up the staffs gdp forecast for this year and next all told real gdp growth was projected to be about the same in as in and then to slow modestly in the coming years partly because of a fading boost from fiscal policy output was forecast to expand at a rate a little above the staffs estimate of its potential rate of growth in and and then to slow to a pace slightly below potential page federal open market committee output growth in the unemployment rate was projected to decline a little further this year and to re main at that lower level through the unemploy ment rate was anticipated to be below the staffs estimate of its longerrun natural rate throughout the forecast pe riod the staffs forecasts for both total and core pce price inflation over the period were essentially unre vised core inflation was still projected to step up a little in but to run a bit below percent both this year and over the next two years total pce price inflation was projected to be a little lower than core inflation in because of a projected decline in consumer energy prices and to be the same as core inflation in and the staff continued to view the uncertainty around its projections for real gdp growth the unemployment rate and inflation as generally similar to the average of the past years the staff viewed the downside risks to economic activity as having diminished a bit further since the previous forecast but still judged that the risks to the forecast for real gdp growth were tilted to the downside with a corresponding skew to the upside for the unemployment rate important factors influencing this assessment were that foreign economic and geopo litical developments still seemed more likely to move in directions that could have significant negative effects on the us economy than to resolve more favorably than assumed in addition softness in business investment and manufacturing production last year as well as the recent weakness in imports was seen as pointing to the possibility of a more substantial slowing in economic growth than the staff projected the risks to the infla tion projection were also viewed as having a downward skew in part because of the downside risks to the fore cast for economic activity participants views on current conditions and the economic outlook participants agreed that the labor market had remained strong over the intermeeting period and that economic activity had risen at a moderate rate job gains had been solid on average in recent months and the unemploy ment rate had remained low although household spending had risen at a moderate pace business fixed investment and exports had remained weak on a month basis overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy were running below per cent marketbased measures of inflation compensation remained low surveybased measures of longerterm in flation expectations were little changed participants generally judged that the current stance of monetary policy was appropriate to support sustained expansion of economic activity strong labor market conditions and inflation returning to the committees symmetric percent objective they expected economic growth to continue at a moderate pace supported by ac commodative monetary and financial conditions in ad dition some trade uncertainties had diminished recently and there were some signs of stabilization in global growth nonetheless uncertainties about the outlook remained including those posed by the outbreak of the coronavirus in their discussion of the household sector participants noted that spending growth had moderated in the fourth quarter however they generally expected that in the period ahead consumption spending would likely re main on a firm footing supported by strong labor mar ket conditions rising incomes and healthy household balance sheets some participants noted the upbeat tone of consumer surveys and a few commented that their district contacts had reported solid retail sales during the holiday shopping season in addition many partici pants were encouraged by the significant pickup since last summer in residential investment a development that reflected in part the effects of lower mortgage rates with respect to the business sector participants ob served that business investment and exports remained weak and that manufacturing output had declined over the past year looking ahead participants were generally cautiously optimistic about the effects on the business sector of the recent favorable trade developments and the signs of stabilization in global growth many partic ipants expressed the view that these developments might boost business confidence or raise export demand which would help strengthen or at least stabilize business investment a few participants remarked that contacts in their districts had noted that business sentiment was brighter or that companies were intending to expand their capital expenditures this year several other partic ipants however judged that the effect of the recent trade agreement with china would be relatively limited as trade uncertainty would likely remain elevated with the possibility remaining of the emergence of new ten sions as well as the reescalation of existing tensions they noted that the agreement would still leave a large portion of tariffs in place and that many firms had al ready been making production and supply chain adjust ments in response to trade tensions minutes of the meeting of january page participants also commented on ongoing challenges fac ing the energy and agriculture sectors a couple of par ticipants remarked that activity in the energy sector con tinued to be weak and a few noted that financial condi tions in the agricultural sector would likely remain chal lenging for many despite farm subsidies from the federal government and recent optimism surrounding trade prospects participants judged that conditions in the labor market remained strong with the unemployment rate at a year low and continued solid job gains on average although the upcoming annual benchmark revision was expected to reduce estimates of recent payroll growth participants expected payroll employment to expand at a healthy pace this year business contacts in many dis tricts indicated continued strong labor demand with several participants mentioning that contacts reported difficulties in finding qualified workers or that observed wage growth might currently understate the degree of tightness in the labor market however a number of participants indicated that aggregate measures of nomi nal wages continued to rise at a moderate pace broadly in line with productivity growth and the rate of inflation several participants commented on potential reasons for the absence of stronger broadbased wage pressures in cluding technological changes that could substitute for labor increased willingness of employees to forgo wage gains for greater job stability adjustments in nonwage portions of compensation packages and the possibility that the labor market was not as tight as the historically low unemployment rate would suggest many partici pants pointed to the strong performance of labor force participation despite the downward pressures associated with an aging population and several raised the possibil ity that there was some room for labor force participa tion to rise further in their discussion of inflation developments partici pants noted that recent readings on overall and core pce price inflation measured on a month basis had continued to run below percent overall participants described their inflation outlook as having changed little since december participants generally expected infla tion to move closer to percent in the coming months as the unusually low readings in early drop out of the month calculation participants also expected that as the economic expansion continues and resource utilization remains high inflation would return to the percent objective on a sustainable basis a few partic ipants expressed less confidence in this outlook for in flation and commented that inflation had averaged less than percent over the past several years even as re source utilization had increased or pointed to down ward pressures from global or technologyrelated factors that could continue to suppress inflation a couple of participants however noted that some alternative infla tion indicators including trimmed mean measures sug gested that there had been a modest stepup in underly ing inflation during or that underlying inflation could already be at a level consistent with the commit tees goal participants generally saw the distribution of risks to the outlook for economic activity as somewhat more favor able than at the previous meeting although a number of downside risks remained prominent the easing of trade tensions resulting from the recent agreement with china and the passage of the usmca as well as tentative signs of stabilization in global economic growth helped reduce downside risks and appeared to buoy business senti ment the risk of a hard brexit had appeared to re cede further in addition statistical models designed to estimate the probability of recession using financial mar ket data suggested that the likelihood of a recession oc curring over the next year had fallen notably in recent months still participants generally expected tradere lated uncertainty to remain somewhat elevated and they were mindful of the possibility that the tentative signs of stabilization in global growth could fade geopolitical risks especially in connection with the middle east re mained the threat of the coronavirus in addition to its human toll had emerged as a new risk to the global growth outlook which participants agreed warranted close watching in their discussion of financial stability participants acknowledged the staff report suggesting that overall fi nancial vulnerabilities remained moderate and that the financial system remained resilient nonetheless several participants observed that equity corporate debt and cre valuations were elevated and drew attention to high levels of corporate indebtedness and weak underwriting standards in leveraged loan markets some participants expressed the concern that financial imbalancesin cluding overvaluation and excessive indebtedness could amplify an adverse shock to the economy that the current conditions of low interest rates and labor market tightness could increase risks to financial stability or that cyber attacks could affect the us financial system sev eral participants noted that planned increases in dividend payouts by large banks and the associated decline in cap ital buffers might leave those banks with less capacity to weather adverse shockswhich could have negative im plications for the economyor that lower bank capital page federal open market committee ratios could be associated with greater tail risks to gdp growth on the other hand capital levels at us banks were quite high relative to other sectors of the financial system raising questions about the potential migration of lending activities away from the us banking sector to areas outside the oversight of federal banking super visors in their consideration of monetary policy at this meeting participants judged that it would be appropriate to main tain the target range for the federal funds rate at to percent to support sustained expansion of economic activity strong labor market conditions and inflation re turning to the committees symmetric percent objec tive with regard to monetary policy beyond this meet ing participants viewed the current stance of policy as likely to remain appropriate for a time provided that in coming information about the economy remained broadly consistent with this economic outlook of course if developments emerged that led to a material reassessment of the outlook an adjustment to the stance of monetary policy would be appropriate in order to foster achievement of the committees dualmandate objectives in commenting on the monetary policy outlook partici pants concurred that maintaining the current stance of policy would give the committee time for a fuller assess ment of the ongoing effects on economic activity of last years shift to a more accommodative policy stance and would also allow policymakers to accumulate further in formation bearing on the economic outlook partici pants discussed how maintaining the current policy stance for a time could be helpful in supporting us eco nomic activity and employment in the face of global de velopments that have been weighing on spending deci sions with regard to the committees pricestability objective participants observed that the current degree of mone tary policy accommodation would be useful in facilitat ing a return of inflation to percent several participants noted that inflation returning to percent would help ensure that longerterm inflation expectations remained consistent with the committees longerrun inflation ob jective a few participants stressed that the committee should be more explicit about the need to achieve its in flation goal on a sustained basis several participants suggested that inflation modestly exceeding percent for a period would be consistent with the achievement of the committees longerrun inflation objective and that such mild overshooting might underscore the sym metry of that objective with regard to the committees maximum employment objective a few participants ob served that the actual level of employment might still be below maximum employment and that maintaining the present monetary policy stance would allow the econ omy to achieve that maximum level a couple of other participants expressed concern that tight labor markets have in the past been associated with economic and fi nancial imbalances and that the emergence of such im balances might jeopardize the longerrun attainment of the committees dualmandate goals participants discussed the open market operations that the federal reserve had undertaken since september to implement monetary policy as well as forthcoming op erational measures participants agreed that the opera tions undertaken by the desk since midseptember had been effective in helping to stabilize conditions in money markets and that implementation of the plan that the committee announced in october to purchase treasury bills and conduct repo operations had proceeded smoothly participants observed that enactment of this plan had succeeded in replenishing reserve balances to levels at or above those prevailing in early september and in ensuring continued control of the federal funds rate many participants stressed that as reserves approached durably ample levels the need for sizable treasury bill purchases and repo operations would di minish and that such operations could be gradually scaled back or phased out beyond that point regular open market operations would be required over time in order to accommodate the trend growth in the federal reserves liabilities and maintain an ample level of re serves participants who commented on the desks pro posal for the transition to the amplereserves regime in dicated that they were comfortable with that proposal they remarked that the details of the committees plans would be adjusted as appropriate to support effective implementation of monetary policy participants noted that it would be important to continue to communicate to the public that open market operations now and in the period ahead were technical operations aimed at achieving and maintaining ample reserves and that any adjustments to those operations were not intended to represent a change in the stance of monetary policy several participants suggested that the committee should resume before long its discussion of the role that repo operations might play in an amplereserves regime including the possible creation of a standing repo facility a couple of these participants cited the potential for such a facility to reduce the banking systems demand for reserves over the longer term minutes of the meeting of january page

into account a wide range of information in cluding measures of labor market conditions indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations and readings on financial and international developments with regard to the postmeeting statement members agreed that incoming data warranted a change in the statements description of recent rises in household spending from strong to moderate they also agreed to describe the current monetary policy stance as consistent with inflation returning to rather than be ing near their symmetric percent longerrun objec tive in commenting on this change in wording a few members noted that the new language would make the postmeeting statement more consistent with the com mittees outlook or might usefully affirm the symmetry of the committees inflation goal and indicate that poli cymakers were not satisfied with inflation outcomes that were persistently below percent at the conclusion of the discussion the committee voted to authorize and direct the federal reserve bank of new york until instructed otherwise to execute transactions in the soma in accordance with the fol lowing domestic policy directive for release at pm effective

financial markets and open market operations the system open market account soma manager first reviewed developments in domestic and global fi nancial markets financial markets remained exception ally volatile amid the global spread of the coronavirus and uncertainty regarding its effects since the meeting of the fomc in late january the sp index de clined percent nominal us treasury yields moved to basis points lower and marketbased measures of inflation compensation fell to basis points investmentgrade and highyield credit spreads widened about basis points and basis points respectively the us dollar appreciated notably against most curren cies with the exception of other safehaven currencies and crude oil prices dropped percent against this backdrop expectations for the path of the federal funds rate adjusted sharply implied rates on federal funds fu tures contracts suggested the committee was expected to reduce the target range full percentage point at its upcoming scheduled meeting following the basis point reduction in the target range in early march in addition market participants reportedly anticipated that the committee would announce additional purchases of treasury securities and agency mortgagebacked securi ties mbs trading conditions across a range of markets were se verely strained in corporate bond markets trading ac tivity and liquidity were at very low levels although not back to the low point reached in market partici pants expected that actions taken to slow the spread of the virus could have significant effects on the credit wor thiness of certain borrowers particularly those at the lower end of the credit spectrum market participants also increasingly pointed to concerns in other segments of the debt market in securitized markets including those for assetbacked securities abs and commercial mortgagebacked securities cmbs primary market is suance slowed and secondary market trading had be come less orderly with money managers selling short dated liquid products to meet investor redemptions in the treasury market following several consecutive days of deteriorating conditions market participants re ported an acute decline in market liquidity a number of primary dealers found it especially difficult to make markets in offtherun treasury securities and reported that this segment of the market had ceased to function effectively this disruption in intermediation was at tributed in part to sales of offtherun treasury securi ties and flighttoquality flows into the most liquid ontherun treasury securities conditions in shortterm funding markets also deterio rated sharply amid a decline in market liquidity and chal lenges in dealer intermediation over recent days the premium paid to obtain dollars through the foreign ex change swap market increased sharply and the volumes in term repurchase agreement repo markets dropped significantly issuance of commercial paper cp matur ing beyond one week reportedly almost dried up at the end of the week before the meeting and primary and secondarymarket liquidity for financial and nonfinancial cp was described as nearly nonexistent at a time when investor concern about issuer credit risk was rising the manager then summarized actions taken by the desk to address some of the strains in financial markets repo lending operations were greatly expanded to ad dress the acute worsening in term funding markets these operations included the addition of largescale one and threemonth term repo operations despite the sizable offering of additional term repo takeup was well below the offered amounts and there was little improvement in treasury market functioning as a result the chair in consultation with the fomc instructed the desk to conduct purchases of treasury securities across a range of maturities the desk also revised the schedule of treasury purchases announcing that billion of the monthly scheduled purchases would be completed on friday march these purchases were conducted across the curve market participants suggested that the page federal open market committee operations had been helpful in addressing some funding pressures but trading conditions in treasury mortgage and credit markets remained severely strained the soma manager noted that if the fomc directed the desk to conduct additional purchases of mbs and treasury securities the desk could initially conduct such purchases at a more rapid pace to more quickly address liquidity strains by unanimous vote the committee ratified the desks domestic transactions over the intermeeting period no intervention operations occurred in foreign currencies for the systems account during the intermeeting period staff review of the economic situation the coronavirus outbreak was disrupting economic ac tivity in many countries including the united states by the time of the march meeting there were limited available us economic data however that covered the period since the intensification of concerns about the domestic effects of the outbreak information that pre dated that period indicated that labor market conditions had remained strong through february and that real gross domestic product gdp appeared to have been increasing at a moderate pace in the first two months of the year consumer price inflation as measured by the month percentage change in the price index for per sonal consumption expenditures pce remained below percent in january surveybased measures of longer run inflation expectations were little changed total nonfarm payroll employment expanded strongly in january and february and the unemployment rate was at its year low of percent in february meanwhile the labor force participation rate and the employment topopulation ratio edged up on net initial claims for unemployment insurance benefitsa timely indicator of a deterioration in labor market conditionsremained near historically low levels through early march which was still before economic shutdowns started to take place in the united states nominal wage growth was moderate on balance average hourly earnings for all employees increased percent over the months end ing in

bank of dallas was percent in january the consumer price index cpi rose percent over the months ending in february and the core cpi increased percent over that same period recent readings on surveybased measures of longerrun inflation expectations were little changed on balance in recent months the survey of professional forecasters measure for the next years was unchanged in the first quarter as was the longerrun measure from the blue chip survey in march the uni versity of michigan surveys of consumers measure for the next to years edged down in february and re mained in the lower part of its prevailing range in early march the threeyearahead measure from the federal reserve bank of new yorks survey of consumer ex pectations edged up in february and remained in its re cent range real pce growth was moderate in january the com ponents of the nominal retail sales data used to estimate pce edged down in february and the pace of sales of light motor vehicles in january and february was above its fourthquarter average however the consumer sen timent measure from the michigan survey started to de cline notably in early march and other daily and weekly sentiment measuressuch as the bloomberg consumer comfort index the morning consult confidence index and the rasmussen consumer indexwere also deteri orating both starts and building permit issuance for single family homes increased in january over their fourth quarter averages and starts of multifamily units also moved up new and existing home sales in january were both above their average fourthquarter

in operationan indicator of business spending for structures in the drilling and mining sectorwas edging up through midmarch and was not yet showing any of the expected falloff from the recent sharp declines in crude oil prices the available data suggested that manufacturing produc tion moved up in february after edging down in january leaving the level of factory output little changed on net minutes of the meeting of march page over the past months although output in the mining sectorwhich includes crude oil extractionhad in creased in january available data indicated that output in this sector would decrease in february the recent sharp declines in crude oil prices pointed to a reduction in min ingsector production over at least the near term total real government purchases appeared to be increas ing moderately federal defense spending rose in janu ary and february and federal employment was boosted by hiring for the census state and local govern ment payrolls expanded strongly in january and febru ary and nominal construction spending by these govern ments increased solidly in january the nominal us international trade deficit narrowed in january as a steep fall in imports more than offset a de cline in exports the fall in imports which followed a sizable fourthquarter decline was led by lower imports of industrial supplies automotive products and capital goods the decline in exports was driven by lower ex ports of capital goods and industrial supplies available indicators suggested that both exports and imports likely declined in february in part reflecting disruptions re lated to the coronavirus outbreak the pace of economic growth abroad was already sub dued before the outbreak in the advanced foreign economies afes real gdp growth had slowed sharply at the end of and indicators pointed to only a modest pickup in economic growth early this year in the emerging market economies emes incoming data had been more positive as indicators for hightech and manufacturing production in asian economies outside of china were upbeat and the effects of social protests in chile and hong kong along with the effects of the general motors strike on mexican economic activity had faded by early february however the coronavirus outbreak in china brought economic activity in many parts of the country to a standstill hubei province the epicenter of the outbreak and a manufacturing hub was put under quarantine and factories across the country were shut down foreign economic indicators for the more recent period following the spread of the virus to the rest of the world were generally not yet available however widespread shutdowns together with lower commodity prices and tighter financial conditions sug gested that activity was weakening sharply

pointed to accommodative financing conditions cre loan growth at banks remained solid through february and cre debt outstanding increased modestly through midfebruary according to available data the primary mortgage rate increased sharply toward the end of the period as mbs market liquidity deteriorated after falling substantially in february and early march capacity constraints at mortgage originators reportedly minutes of the meeting of march page intensified while borrower interest in refinancing in creased significantly from already elevated levels more over additional constraints emerged as it became more difficult to conduct operations that usually happen face toface financing conditions in consumer credit markets wors ened late in the intermeeting period strains began ap pearing in consumer abs markets although less so than in other fixedincome markets in march consumer abs spreads widened sharply liquidity deteriorated and new issuance became sporadic lenders in consumer credit markets began developing programs to assist bor rowers whose finances were affected by the outbreak earlier in the intermeeting period financing conditions had been generally supportive of growth credit card balances and auto loan balances both appeared to grow solidly through february according to banks data con tinuing their growth in the fourth quarter conditions for subprime credit card borrowers remained relatively tight but showed some signs of easing staff economic outlook the projection for the us economy prepared by the staff for the march fomc meeting was downgraded sig nificantly from the january meeting forecast in response to news on the spread of the coronavirus at home and abroad and in response to a related substantial mark down of the staffs foreign economic outlook along with recent financial market movements real gdp was forecast to decline and the unemployment rate to rise on net in the first half of this year given the downside risks and the elevated uncertainty about how much the economy would weaken and how long it would take to recover the staff provided two plausible economic sce narios that spanned a range of possibilities importantly the future performance of the economy would depend on the evolution of the virus outbreak and the measures undertaken to contain it in one scenario economic ac tivity started to rebound in the second half of this year in a more adverse scenario the economy entered reces sion this year with a recovery much slower to take hold and not materially under way until next year in both scenarios inflation was projected to weaken reflecting both the deterioration in resource utilization and sizable expected declines in consumer energy prices participants views on current conditions and the economic outlook participants noted that the coronavirus outbreak was harming communities and disrupting economic activity in many countries including the united states and that global financial conditions had also been significantly af fected participants expressed their deep concern for those whose health had been harmed and observed that the matter was above all a public health emergency they commented that the measuressuch as social dis tancingtaken in response to the pandemic while needed to contain the outbreak would nevertheless take a toll on us economic activity in the near term participants noted that available economic data showed that the us economy came into this challenging period on a strong footing information received since the committee met in january indicated that the labor mar ket remained strong through february and that eco nomic activity rose at a moderate rate job gains had been solid on average in recent months and the unem ployment rate had remained low although household spending had risen at a moderate pace business fixed investment and exports had remained weak further more in recent weeks the energy sector had come under stress due to the sharp drop in oil prices on a month basis overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy had been running below percent surveybased measures of longerterm inflation expecta tions had been little changed however marketbased measures of inflation compensation had declined all participants viewed the nearterm us economic outlook as having deteriorated sharply in recent weeks and as having become profoundly uncertain many par ticipants had repeatedly downgraded their outlook of late in response to the rapidly evolving situation all saw us economic activity as likely to decline in the coming quarter and viewed downside risks to the economic out look as having increased significantly participants noted that the timing of the resumption of growth in the us economy depended on the containment measures put in place as well as the success of those measures and on the responses of other policies including fiscal policy with regard to households behavior participants noted that although consumption spending had been a key driver of growth in economic activity through the first two months of this year the pandemic was starting to impair consumer confidence and to exert an adverse ef fect on household balance sheets participants reported that wideranging socialdistancing measures were in op eration or in prospect in their districts these measureswhich included temporary closures of some physical locations such as stores and restaurants in which consumers purchased goods and serviceswould have the effect of reducing inperson transactions by households online shopping could substitute for some page federal open market committee of this activity but was unlikely to replace it fully the housing market was likely to be disrupted by social dis tancing by financial uncertaintyincluding difficulties that households and businesses would face in meeting mortgage or rental paymentsand by volatility in the market for mbs participants stressed the major down side risk that the spread of the virus might intensify in those areas of the country currently less affected thereby sidelining many more us workers and further damping purchases by consumers participants expressed con cern that households with low incomes had less of a sav ings buffer with which to meet expenses during the in terruption to economic activity this situation made those households more vulnerable to a downturn in the economy and tended to magnify the reduction in aggre gate demand associated with the nations response to the pandemic participants relayed reports on business sectors already badly hit by the response to the coronavirus outbreak these sectors included those affected by the cancellation of many events decisions by firms and households to reduce travel governmentmandated reductions in entry from abroad and cutbacks on economic activity that re quired inperson interaction firms directly affected in cluded those connected to air travel cruise lines hotels tourism services sports and recreation entertainment hospitality and restaurants in the past week pullbacks in purchases at retail stores except for emergency buy ing had reportedly intensified significantly in addition the energy sector had come under stress because of re cent large declines in oil prices many us businesses had moved to telework arrangements other businesses however could not readily shift to telework status or had limited telework technology participants observed that the coronavirus outbreak had inevitably hurt business confidence and that the expected length and severity of the restrictions on economic activity that involved in person interaction would importantly affect the size of the response of investment spending to the situation participants expressed concern about the financial strain that many us firms were under because of the loss of business and the extraordinary turbulence in financial markets with regard to supply chains many contacts had reported that some linkages in china had been re stored and that they were able to draw on inventory sup plies and on alternative supply chains however in some areas of the country the construction industry had re ported continuing disruptions to supply chains from china participants indicated that disruptions in the eu ropean economy and recent restrictions on travel from europe to the united states would adversely affect the us economys supply chains so too if it eventuated would a large increase in us worker unavailability be cause of health reasons several participants emphasized concern about the capacity of the health care system in the current situation and welcomed measures taken to prevent the systems overall capacity from being ex ceeded participants noted that foreign economic growth for the first half of this year would be badly hit by the severe disruptions to economic activity abroad associated with the response to the coronavirus outbreak including the recent measures taken in major european countries however some encouraging signs had come from china in recent weeks in the form of indications of increasing production and of more purchases of us goods with regard to the labor market participants noted that some firms would likely need to cut employment imme diately other firms however were looking for ways to retain employees during the period of reduced economic activity in order to maintain capacity and be able to ramp up production once the public health crisis abated and demand rebounded measures that reportedly helped partially substitute for layoffs included the en couragement by employers of voluntary leaves of ab sence nonreplacement of departing workers and in creased reliance on the delivery of goods to customers in place of onsite purchases participants observed that businesses would be more likely to lay off workers on a major scale if the downturn in economic activity came to be perceived as likely to be protracted participants commented that workers most severely affected in the current situation were those who were ill those with low incomes those connected to the most hardhit sectors and those with irregular or contingent employment they also noted that many workers had jobs that did not permit working from home with regard to inflation participants noted that it had been running below the committees percent longer run objective before the coronavirus outbreak they re marked that a stronger dollar weaker demand and lower oil prices were factors likely to put downward pressure on inflation in the period ahead and observed that this meant that the return of inflation to the committees percent longerrun objective would likely be further delayed participants indicated however that imple menting a more accommodative stance of monetary pol icy at this meeting could be useful in helping offset these factors over time and in achieving the percent inflation minutes of the meeting of march page objective over the longer run by helping prevent cir cumstances of persistent resource slack or a lasting de cline in inflation expectations participants all agreed that the effects of the pandemic would weigh on economic activity in the near term and that the duration of this period of weakness was uncer tain they further concurred that the unpredictable ef fects of the coronavirus outbreak were a source of major downside risks to the economic outlook participants raised several alternative scenarios with regard to the likely behavior of economic activity in the second half of this year these scenarios differed from one another in the assumed length and severity of disruptions to eco nomic activity several participants emphasized that the temporary nature of the shock to economic activity the fact that the shock arose in the nonfinancial sector and the healthy state of the us banking system all implied that the current situation was not directly comparable with the previous decades financial crisis and it need not be followed by negative effects on economic activity as longlasting as those associated with that crisis partici pants stressed that measures taken in the areas of health care policy and fiscal policy together with actions by the private sector would be important in shaping the timing and speed of the us economys return to normal con ditions participants agreed that the federal reserves efforts to relieve stress in financial markets would help limit downside nearterm outcomes by supporting credit flows to households and businesses and that a more ac commodative monetary policy stance would provide support to economic activity beyond the near term among the downside risks to this years us economic outlook participants prominently cited the possibility of the virus outbreak becoming more widespread than ex pected such an event could lead to more wideranging temporary shutdowns with adverse implications for the production of goods and services and for aggregate de mand with regard to financial developments over the inter meeting period participants noted that financial markets had exhibited extraordinary turbulence and stresses participants commented on the conditions of high vola tility and illiquidity characterizing the markets for us treasury securities especially offtherun longerterm securities and for agency mbs participants expressed concern about the disruptions to the functioning of these markets especially in view of their status as cor nerstones for the operation of the us and global finan cial systems and for the transmission of monetary policy participants observed that federal reserve operations in recent days had provided some relief with regard to the liquidity problems but they noted that severe illiquidity continued to prevail in key securities markets many par ticipants pointed to other dislocations in funding mar kets that could impede financial intermediation to households and businesses they highlighted the acute problems that many firms were facing in issuing cp and corporate bonds participants further noted that many businesses were tapping their backup credit lines with commercial banks participants also discussed the im plications of recent financial market turbulence for money market funds and government bond funds and for debt issuance by state and local governments in their consideration of monetary policy at this meeting most participants judged that it would be appropriate to lower the target range for the federal funds rate by basis points to to percent in discussing the reasons for such a decision these participants pointed to a likely decline in economic activity in the near term re lated to the effects of the coronavirus outbreak and the extremely large degree of uncertainty regarding how long and severe such a decline in activity would be in light of the sharply increased downside risks to the economic outlook posed by the global coronavirus outbreak these participants noted that riskmanagement considerations pointed toward a forceful monetary policy response with the majority favoring a basis point cut that would bring the target range to its effective lower bound elb with regard to monetary policy beyond this meeting these participants judged that it would be ap propriate to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at to percent until policymakers were con fident that the economy had weathered recent events and was on track to achieve the committees maximum employment and price stability goals a few participants preferred a basis point cut at this meeting and noted that such a decision would provide support to economic activity in the face of the antici pated effects of the coronavirus these participants pre ferred to wait until there was greater assurance that the transmission mechanism of monetary policy via financial markets and the supply of credit to households and busi nesses was working effectively this would allow fiscal and public health policy responses to the coronavirus outbreak to take hold and preserve the ability of the committee to lower the target range which was close to the elb in the event of a further deterioration in the economic outlook in addition these participants noted that a lowering of the target range by basis points coming so soon after the reduction of basis points less than two weeks earlier ran the risk of sending an overly negative signal about the economic outlook page federal open market committee participants also considered open market operations to purchase treasury securities and agency mbs to support the smooth functioning of these securities markets which in turn would help support the supply of credit to households and businesses participants generally agreed that over the coming months it would be appro priate to increase the federal reserves holdings of treasury securities by at least billion and its hold ings of agency mbs by at least billion addition ally all principal payments from the federal reserves holdings of agency debt and agency mbs would be rein vested in agency mbs those treasury and agency mbs purchases would be in addition to the recently expanded overnight and term repo operations conducted by the desk participants stressed that it was important to communicate that the committee would be prepared to increase the size of the securities purchases as needed on the basis of its close monitoring of market condi tions some participants noted that it was important to stress in communications that the primary purpose of these asset purchases was to support the smooth func tioning of treasury and agency mbs markets rather than to provide further monetary policy accommodation by pushing down longerterm yields a couple of partici pants noted that because some of the purchases would be at longer maturities the purchases could provide some accommodation by lowering longerterm yields participants discussed some of the possible communica tions challenges associated with the committees policy decisions at this meeting several participants noted that it would be important to communicate clearly and con sistently about the rationale for the policy decisions taken at this meeting some participants remarked that the committees policy actions regarding the target range and balance sheet could be interpreted as convey ing negative news about the economic outlook a few participants also remarked that lowering the target range to the elb could increase the likelihood that some mar ket interest rates would turn negative or foster investor expectations of negative policy rates such expectations would run counter to participants previously expressed views that they would prefer to use other monetary pol icy tools to provide further accommodation at the elb additionally several participants remarked that the pub lic might view the ability of the committee to provide further monetary policy accommodation as being lim ited however some participants noted that the com mittee would still be able to provide monetary policy ac commodation even after lowering the target range for the federal funds rate to the elb in particular new forward guidance or balance sheet measures could be in troduced participants also indicated strong support for related ac tions taken by the board of governors to support the credit needs of households and businesses to lower the primary credit rate by basis points to percent and to allow depository in stitutions to borrow from the discount window for periods as long as days in order to encour age more active use of the discount window on the part of depository institutions to meet unex pected funding needs to encourage depository institutions to utilize in traday credit to support the provision of liquidity to households and businesses and the smooth functioning of payment systems to encourage banks to use their capital and li quidity buffers as they provide loans to house holds and businesses affected by the coronavirus and undertake other supportive actions in a safe and sound manner to reduce reserve requirements to percent in light of the shift to an amplereserves regime and to support lending to households and businesses by depository institutions participants also indicated support for enhancing in co ordination with the bank of canada the bank of eng land the bank of japan the european central bank and the swiss national bank the provision of liquidity via the standing us dollar liquidity swap line arrangements the pricing on the standing us dollar swap arrange ments would be lowered by basis points so that the new rate would be the us dollar ois rate plus basis points and us dollars would be offered by foreign cen tral banks with an day maturity in addition to the week maturity operations following this discussion the chair indicated that these changes to the standing us dollar liquidity swap line arrangements would be implemented consistent with the procedures described in the authorization for foreign currency operations participants generally commented that these additional measures would be helpful in supporting the flow of credit to households and businesses a few participants commented that stigma associated with the discount window may still be present or that further action such as a relaunch of the term auction facility might be needed to encourage banks to take up additional fund ing a few other participants noted that discount win minutes of the meeting of march page dow stigma should be less of a concern than it was pre viously in particular these participants cited the lower ing of the primary credit rate to the top of the target range for the federal funds rate offering term funding for up to days and regulators encouraging banks to use the discount window to continue prudently lending to households and businesses several participants com mented that banks should be discouraged from repur chasing shares from or paying dividends to their equity holders in the wake of the proposed measures partici pants generally noted that other measures to support the flow of credit to households and businesses including those that relied on section of the federal reserve act might be needed in such an uncertain and rapidly evolving environment and that it would be prudent for the federal reserve to develop and remain prepared to implement such measures committee policy action in their discussion of monetary policy for this

economy had weathered recent events and was on track to achieve the committees maximum em ployment and price stability goals one member pre ferred to lower the target range by basis points to to percent at this meeting in support of the actions taken to promote smooth market functioning and the flow of credit to households and businesses and in light of the anticipated effects of the coronavirus on eco nomic activity and the economic outlook in this partic ipants view a basis point cut would preserve space for further cuts in the target range that could be imple mented when market conditions had improved enough to ensure that the monetary policy transmission mecha nism was functioning members noted that they would continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook including information related to public health as well as global developments and muted inflation pres sures and that the committee would use its tools and act as appropriate to

vul nerabilities associated with the transition to alternative work arrangements and the potential for impaired mar ket functioning the staff then provided an update on current conditions and changes to the economic outlook since the fomcs january meeting available indicators for china sug gested that the spread of the coronavirus had been asso ciated with a collapse in economic activity during

scenarios involv ing a greater spread of the coronavirus and more severe socialdistancing actions would be associated with a greater shutdown of production and disruption of sup ply chains larger negative effects on consumer and busi ness sentiment more significant increases in unemploy ment and worsening financial conditions reductions in demand coupled with a stronger us dollar and weaker commodity prices were expected to put down ward pressure on inflation with the magnitude of the softening in core inflation depending on the severity of the situation fomc participants discussed the significant outbreaks of the coronavirus that had emerged recently in a few countries outside china and the likelihood that the virus would spread widely around the world including in the united states while the economic outlook at the time of the committees january meeting had been favorable the potential spread of the virus and the measures needed to protect communities from it represented a material downside risk to the us economy a forceful monetary policy action could provide a clear signal to the public that policymakers recognized the potential eco nomic significance of the situation and were willing to move decisively to support the achievement of the com mittees dual mandate goals and counter the recent tight ening of financial conditions although a reduction in the

boston and new york respectively a lee smith research and policy advisor federal reserve bank of kansas city developments in financial markets and open mar ket operations the system open market account soma manager first discussed developments in financial markets fi nancial conditions had shown notable improvement over recent weeks equity price indexes were up sub stantially from the lows of late march safehaven de mands for the dollar had receded and measures of real ized and implied volatility across markets had dimin ished market participants pointed to swift and forceful actions taken by the federal reserve coupled with strong fiscal measures and some indications of a slowing in the spread of the coronavirus covid in major economies as factors contributing to these develop ments that said market participants remained very uncertain about the economic outlook and contacts highlighted an array of remaining risks including those in corporate credit markets emerging markets and mortgage mar kets in corporate credit markets concerns about po tential defaults were rising and ratings agencies had put on negative watch or downgraded many issuers in emerging markets the steep decline in commodity prices was exacerbating financial pressures for some emerging market economies emes which were also facing strains arising from capital outflows and a reduction in trade activity and in mortgage markets the likely in crease in mortgage delinquencies associated with for bearance polices and an eventual rise in defaults were sources of concern for bank and nonbank lenders open market desk surveys suggested that market par ticipants anticipated a sharp nearterm decline in eco nomic activity followed by some recovery later this year against this backdrop market participants generally ex pected the target range for the federal funds rate to re main at the effective lower bound for the next couple of years respondents to desk surveys attached almost no probability to the fomc implementing negative policy rates some survey respondents indicated that they ex pected modifications to the committees forward guid ance but not at the current meeting the manager then reviewed recent open market opera tions since midmarch at the direction of the fomc the desk had purchased very large quantities of treasury and agency mortgagebacked securities mbs in order to support the smooth functioning of these critical mar kets the desk evaluated a broad array of indicators to assess market functioning these indicators suggested considerable improvement in market functioning and the desk gradually scaled back the pace of purchases ac cordingly market participants anticipated that the pace of purchases would slow after the june meeting but they expected that outright securities holdings in the soma portfolio would continue to expand at least through the end of the year the soma manager expected that if page federal open market committee conditions continued to improve the pace of purchases could be reduced somewhat further however consistent with the directive the desk was prepared to increase purchases as needed should market functioning worsen conditions in money markets had improved over recent weeks the intense strains across a range of shortterm funding markets that emerged in march had subsided the expansion of federal reserve repurchase agreement repo operations the enhancement and expansion of funding available through the discount window and swap lines and the funding provided through the pri mary dealer credit facility pdcf the money market mutual fund liquidity facility mmlf and the com mercial paper funding facility cpff were likely im portant in relieving pressures across a range of short term funding markets the manager noted that despite these improvements rates in some term funding mar kets remained elevated although forward measures sug gested the upward pressure on these rates might ease in coming weeks with conditions in shortterm funding markets having improved substantially and with repo operations no longer needed to maintain ample reserve levels the manager noted that it might be appropriate to position the federal reserves repurchase operations in a backstop role for example the minimum bid rate in repo operations could be increased somewhat relative to the level of the interest rate on excess reserves the ioer rate later in the intermeeting period shortterm interest rates drifted lower and settled at nearzero levels al though rates appeared stable the manager suggested that circumstances could arise in which temporarily raising the percounterparty limit on the overnight reverse repo operation would support policy implementation the manager also noted that some market participants antic ipated that the federal reserve might increase the ioer rate in order to move the federal funds rate closer to the middle of the target range and to address market func tioning issues that could arise over time with overnight rates at very low levels however there appeared to be limited risk that the federal funds rate would move be low the target range as the federal home loan banks the dominant lenders in the federal funds marketcan earn a zero rate on balances maintained in their account at the federal reserve moreover there were few signs to date that the low level of overnight funding rates had adversely affected market functioning and trading vol umes remained robust the soma manager noted that the staff would continue to monitor developments the committee voted unanimously to renew the recip rocal currency arrangements with the bank of canada and the bank of mexico these arrangements are associ ated with the federal reserves participation in the north american framework agreement of in ad dition the committee voted unanimously to renew the dollar and foreign currency liquidity swap arrangements with the bank of canada the bank of england the bank of japan the european central bank and the swiss na tional bank the votes to renew the federal reserves participation in these standing arrangements occur an nually at the april or may fomc meeting by unanimous vote the committee ratified the desks domestic transactions over the intermeeting period there were no intervention operations in foreign curren cies for the systems account during the intermeeting pe riod staff review of the economic situation the coronavirus outbreak and the measures taken to protect public health were severely disrupting economic activity in the united states and abroad the available information for the april meeting indicated that us labor market conditions deteriorated substantially in march and april and real gross domestic product gdp declined sharply in the first quarter of the year in addition a variety of economic indicators were al ready pointing toward an extraordinary contraction in gdp in the second quarter consumer price inflation as measured by the month percentage change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures pce remained below percent in february job losses surged in march even though the drop in to tal nonfarm payroll employment reflected only those changes that had occurred through the midmonth ref erence period of the establishment survey in addition the unemployment rate jumped to percent in march and the labor force participation rate decreased notably after economic shutdowns started to occur on a wide spread basis initial claims for unemployment insurance benefits skyrocketed in the second half of march through the first half of april a development that pointed to substantial job losses in april nominal wage growth remained moderate as average hourly earnings for all employees increased percent over the months ending in march total pce price inflation and core pce price inflation which excludes consumer food and energy prices both increased percent over the months ending in feb ruary the trimmed mean measure of month pce price inflation constructed by the federal reserve bank minutes of the meeting of april page of dallas was percent in february the consumer price index cpi rose percent over the months ending in march and the core cpi increased percent over the same period the total cpi rose less than the core cpi mostly because of substantial declines in con sumer energy prices which were reflecting significantly lower crude oil prices recent readings on surveybased measures of longerrun inflation expectations were little changed on balance the university of michigan sur veys of consumers measure for the next to years edged up in april and the yearahead measure from the federal reserve bank of new yorks survey of con sumer expectations edged down in march both measures remained in their recent ranges real pce declined steeply in the first quarter of the year the components of the nominal retail sales data used to estimate pce along with the sales of light motor vehi cles fell substantially in march reflecting the effects of the widespread economic shutdowns moreover the consumer sentiment measures from both the michigan and the conference board surveys deteriorated substan tially over march and april real disposable personal income was about flat in the first quarter so the personal saving rate moved up notably with the decline in spend ing in contrast to other sectors of the economy real resi dential investment expanded strongly in the first quarter as a whole although housingsector activity had started to slow dramatically late in the quarter starts and build ing permit issuance for singlefamily homes along with starts of multifamily units tumbled in march in addi tion sales of both new and existing homes contracted sharply in march and survey measures of builders sen timent plunged in april real business fixed investment slumped in the first quar ter following moderate declines over the previous three quarters spending for business equipment fell consid erably in the first quarter led by a sharp decrease in pur chases of transportation equipment business invest ment in nonresidential structures also dropped notably the coronavirus outbreak and the effects on economic activity of measures to contain it together with the as sociated elevated level of uncertainty were likely re flected in recent downbeat readings on business senti ment in national and regional surveys and appeared to weigh heavily on business investment in addition the effects of substantial further declines in crude oil prices were being seen in the falling number of crude oil and natural gas rigs in operation through late april an indi cator of business spending on structures in the drilling and mining sector total industrial production fell precipitously in march as the coronavirus outbreak led many factories to close late in the month the decline in manufacturing output was led by a pullback in the production of motor vehi cles and related parts output in the mining sector which includes crude oil extractionalso decreased sig nificantly in the wake of the recent declines in crude oil prices total real government purchases only edged up in the first quarter led by a modest increase in federal pur chases state and local purchases were about flat reflect ing the effects of public school closures beginning in midmarch real exports declined sharply in the first quarter how ever imports declined at a much faster rate so that net exports made a sizable positive contribution to gdp growth much of the quarterly decline in trade volumes reflected a sharp drop in march due to weak demand globally and disruptions related to the coronavirus out break the fall in exports was concentrated in services particularly those parts of the sector held down by travel restrictions foreign economic activity fell sharply in the first quarter of the year amid widespread mandatory business shut downs and strict socialdistancing measures to contain the spread of the coronavirus outbreak in china where lockdowns were first implemented real gdp contracted sharply in the first quarter and canada korea and sin gapore also saw substantial declines monthly indicators suggested that activity also plummeted in march and april in many other economies particularly in the euro area and the united kingdom which both saw purchas ing managers indexes fall to recordlow levels many foreign governments announced large fiscal packages to address the sudden loss of income by firms and house holds many foreign central banks cut policy rates initi ated or enhanced credit facilities relaxed capital require ments for financial institutions and ramped up asset purchase programs to alleviate liquidity concerns in for eign capital

federal reserves an nouncements in late march of the primary market cor porate credit facility and the secondary market corpo rate credit facility conditions in the market for corpo rate bonds and loans improved further in response to the federal reserves announcement in april that it would expand these facilities to include firms that had been recently downgraded to just below investment grade status commercial and industrial ci lending conditions were somewhat tight although ci loans increased strongly this increase was largely driven by firms draw ing down existing lines of credit they reportedly did so to shore up liquidity for precautionary motives and to meet funding needs in the april senior loan officer opinion survey on bank lending practices sloos banks reported having tightened their ci lending standards and terms for firms of all sizes credit quality and the earnings outlook of nonfinancial corporations deteriorated substantially and market analysts forecast a large volume of downgrades of nonfinancial corporate bonds including a substantial volume from tripleb to speculative grade credit conditions for small businesses were tight concerns about the

experienced weaker demand for all consumer loan types auto loan interest rates dropped sharply in early april as manufacturers in troduced attractive financing programs to boost sales the staff assessed the stability of the financial system during the coronavirus outbreak the banking sector including the large banks was resilient coming into this period banks were able to meet surging demand for draws on credit lines while also building loan loss re serves to absorb higher expected defaults in other parts of the financial system however some notable vulnera bilities that had been identified in previous financial sta bility assessments exacerbated financial strains in march institutional prime mmfs and other institutions relying on unstable funding sources faced significant stress a situation that put in jeopardy the orderly func tioning of some financial markets federal reserve ac tions to enhance the liquidity and functioning of key markets reduced these stresses notably openend mu tual funds that invest in corporate bonds and loans institutions that typically face a timing mismatch be tween investors ability to redeem shares and the funds ability to sell assetsexperienced heavy outflows and li quidity strains in midmarch redemptions later eased however amid the general improvement in financial markets business debt which appeared to be high com pared with fundamentals before the coronavirus out break seemed poised to rise further as businesses bor rowed to maintain their capacity to restart operations values of cre faced the risk of large declines in re sponse to the coronavirus outbreak although updated readings were not yet available the staff provided a pre liminary reading on potential emerging risks to financial stability in the aftermath of the coronavirus outbreak this reading highlighted possible vulnerabilities in mort gage servicers insurance companies and large highly leveraged financial intermediaries staff economic outlook the projection for the us economy prepared by the staff for the april fomc meeting was downgraded no tably from the march meeting forecast in response to information on the spread of the coronavirus and the measures undertaken to contain it both at home and abroad us real gdp was forecast to plummet and the unemployment rate to soar in the second quarter of this year the substantial fiscal policy measures and mone tary policy support that had been put in place were ex pected to help mitigate the deterioration in economic conditions and help boost the recovery the staff noted that importantly the future perfor mance of the economy would depend on the evolution of the coronavirus outbreak and the measures under taken to contain it under the staffs baseline assump tions that the current restrictions on social interactions and business operations would ease gradually this year real gdp was forecast to rise appreciably and the unem ployment rate to decline considerably in the second half of the year although a complete recovery was not ex pected by yearend inflation was projected to weaken this year reflecting both the deterioration in resource utilization and sizable expected declines in consumer en ergy prices under the baseline assumptions economic conditions were projected to continue to improve and inflation to pick back up over the next two years the staff observed that uncertainty regarding the eco nomic effects of the coronavirus outbreak was extremely elevated and that the historical behavior of the us economy in response to past economic shocks pro vided limited guidance for making judgments about how the economy might evolve over coming quarters in light of the significant uncertainty and downside risks as sociated with the evolution of the coronavirus outbreak how much the economy would weaken and how long it would take to recover the staff judged that a more pes simistic projection was no less plausible than the baseline forecast in this scenario a second wave of the corona virus outbreak with another round of strict restrictions on social interactions and business operations was as sumed to begin around yearend inducing a decrease in real gdp a jump in the unemployment rate and re newed downward pressure on inflation next year com pared with the baseline the disruption to economic ac tivity was more severe and protracted in this scenario minutes of the meeting of april page with real gdp and inflation lower and the unemploy ment rate higher by the end of the mediumterm projec tion participants views on current conditions and the economic outlook participants noted that the coronavirus outbreak was causing tremendous human and economic hardship across the united states and around the world the vi rus and the measures taken to protect public health were inducing sharp declines in economic activity and a surge in job losses weaker demand and significantly lower oil prices were holding down consumer price inflation the disruptions to economic activity here and abroad had significantly affected financial conditions and had im paired the flow of credit to us households and busi nesses participants judged that the effects of the coronavirus outbreak and the ongoing public health crisis would con tinue to weigh heavily on economic activity employ ment and inflation in the near term and would pose con siderable risks to the economic outlook over the me dium term participants assessed that the second quarter would likely see overall economic activity decline at an unprecedented rate participants relayed information from their districts that the burdens of the present crisis would fall disproportionately on the most vulnerable and financially constrained households in the economy participants agreed that recently enacted fiscal programs were delivering valuable direct financial aid to house holds businesses and communities that would provide some relief during the economic shutdown in addition economic activity was being supported by actions taken by the federal reserve including lending facilities cre ated under the authority of section of the federal reserve act some of which included capital allocated by the us treasury these programs had helped maintain the flow of credit to households businesses and state and local governments while supporting the smooth functioning of financial markets regarding the economic activity of households partici pants noted that the pandemic and efforts to mitigate the spread of the disease were having severely adverse ef fects on aggregate household spending and consumer confidence participants reported that consumer spend ing had plummeted across all parts of the country and in most categories of spending with especially sharp de clines in expenditures for categories that had been most affected by social distancing such as hotel fuel air travel restaurant theater and other retail products and services participants noted that even after government imposed socialdistancing restrictions came to an end consumer spending in these categories likely would not return quickly to more normal levels surveybased measures of consumer confidence also plunged a devel opment that participants and district contacts attributed to households concerns regarding the risk of job loss or difficulty in meeting financial obligations participants noted that some households experiencing job losses may not immediately face lower total income because of the support from recently enacted fiscal programs even in such cases however participants observed that house hold spending would likely be held down by a decrease in confidence and an increase in precautionary saving participants noted that business activity and investment spending had also fallen dramatically since the previous meeting as a result of efforts to contain the coronavirus outbreak manufacturing output declined sharply in march and was expected by participants to drop even more rapidly in april in all districts some businesses had been forced to close temporarily because of social distancing restrictions businesses that were able to re main open to some degree were also substantially af fected by the pandemic with many experiencing either substantial drops in new orders and sales or supply chain disruptions there were widespread reports from dis trict contacts of firms reducing their payrolls and curtail ing plans for investment spending some industries were especially hard hit including airlines cruise ships restau rants and tourism participants reported that many firms were seeking loans payment deferrals or grants to help address critical financial obligations and that the paycheck protection program ppp was providing val uable assistance to small businesses in this respect par ticipants also noted the disproportionate burdens or par ticular challenges being faced by small businesses these challenges included lower cash buffers fewer financing options and more recently tighter lending standards participants expressed concerns that a large number of small businesses may not be able to endure a shock that had longlasting financial effects participants were fur ther concerned that even after socialdistancing require ments were eased some business models may no longer be economically viable which could occur for example if consumers voluntarily continued to avoid participating in particular forms of economic activity in addition participants expressed concern that the possibility of secondary outbreaks of the virus may cause businesses for some time to be reluctant to engage in new projects rehire workers or make new capital expenditures participants observed that conditions in the energy sec tor had become especially difficult a sharp reduction page federal open market committee in global demand for petroleum had led to unused sup ply that was overwhelming storage capacity resulting in a plunge in oil prices some participants expressed con cern that low energy prices if they were to persist had the potential to create a wave of bankruptcies in the en ergy sector in addition the agricultural sector was un der severe stress due to falling prices for some farm commodities and pandemicrelated disruptions such as the closing of some food processing plants with regard to the labor market participants noted that incoming data confirmed that an extreme decline in em ployment was under way nationally initial claims for unemployment insurance benefits had totaled more than million from midmarch to the time of the meeting and participants expected that the unemployment rate would soon reach the highest levels of the postworld war ii period district contacts reported that a signifi cant portion of workers had been able to switch to work ing remotely although many employers were trying to keep workers on their payrolls over time as conditions persisted there had begun to be widespread furloughs and layoffs participants were concerned that temporary layoffs could become permanent and that workers who lose employment could face a loss of jobspecific skills or may become discouraged and exit the labor force participants were additionally concerned that employees who were on low incomes would be the most severely affected by job cuts because they were employed in the industries most affected by the response to the outbreak or because their jobs were not amenable to being carried out remotely with regard to inflation participants noted that it had been running below the committees percent longer run objective before the coronavirus outbreak while the pandemic had created some supply constraints which had generated upward pressure on the prices of some goods the pandemic had also reduced demand which had exerted downward pressure on prices the overall effect of the outbreak on prices was seen as dis inflationary in addition a stronger dollar and lower oil prices were factors likely to put downward pressure on inflation and marketbased measures of inflation com pensation remained very low participants observed that the return of inflation to the committees percent longerrun objective would likely be further delayed but that the accommodative stance of monetary policy would be helpful in achieving the percent inflation ob jective over the longer run participants noted that recently enacted fiscal programs were crucial for limiting the severity of the economic downturn in particular the cares act and other legis lation which represented more than trillion in federal spending in total had provided direct help to house holds businesses and communities for example the ppp was providing a financial lifeline to small busi nesses the expansion of unemployment benefits was helping restore lost income for laidoff workers and the treasury had provided a necessary financial backstop to many federal reserve lending facilities participants acknowledged that even greater fiscal support may be necessary if the economic downturn persists participants commented that in addition to weighing heavily on economic activity in the near term the eco nomic effects of the pandemic created an extraordinary amount of uncertainty and considerable risks to eco nomic activity in the medium term participants dis cussed several alternative scenarios with regard to the behavior of economic activity in the medium term that all seemed about equally likely these scenarios differed in the assumed length of the pandemic and the conse quent economic disruptions on the one hand a num ber of participants judged that there was a substantial likelihood of additional waves of outbreak in the near or medium term in such scenarios it was believed likely that there would be further economic disruptions in cluding additional periods of mandatory social distanc ing greater supply chain dislocations and a substantial number of business closures and loss of income in total such developments could lead to a protracted period of severely reduced economic activity on the other hand economic activity could recover more quickly if the pan demic subsided enough for households and businesses to become sufficiently confident to relax or modify so cialdistancing behaviors over the next several months beyond these considerations participants noted the risk that foreign economies particularly emes could come under extreme pressure as a result of the pandemic and that this strain could spill over to and hamper us eco nomic activity participants stressed that measures taken in the areas of healthcare policy and fiscal policy to gether with actions by the private sector would be im portant in shaping the timing and speed of the us economys return to more normal conditions in addition participants agreed that recent actions taken by the federal reserve were essential in helping reduce downside risks to the economic outlook participants also noted several risks to longterm eco nomic performance that were posed by the pandemic one of these risks was that workers who lose employ ment as a result of the pandemic may experience a loss of skills lose access to adequate childcare or eldercare minutes of the meeting of april page or become discouraged and exit the labor force the longerterm behavior of firms could be affected as wellfor instance if necessary but costly transmission mitigation strategies lowered firms productivity if busi ness investment shifted down permanently if many firms need to adjust their business models in the after math of the pandemic or if business closures particu larly those of small firms became widespread a few participants noted that higher levels of government in debtedness which would be exacerbated by fiscal ex penditures that were necessary to combat the economic effects of the pandemic could put downward pressure on growth in aggregate potential output regarding developments in financial markets partici pants agreed that ongoing actions by the federal reserve had been instrumental in easing strains in some essential financial markets and supporting the flow of credit these actions included largescale purchases of treasury securities and agency mbs measures to reduce strains in global us dollar funding markets and the launch of programs to support the flow of credit in the economy for households businesses of all sizes and state and lo cal governments banks had entered the crisis well cap italized and had been able to provide necessary credit to businesses and households a number of participants commented on potential risks to financial stability participants were concerned that banks could come under greater stress particularly if ad verse scenarios for the spread of the pandemic and eco nomic activity were realized and so this sector should be monitored carefully participants saw risks to banks and some other financial institutions as exacerbated by high levels of indebtedness among nonfinancial corporations that prevailed before the pandemic this indebtedness in creased these firms risk of insolvency the upcoming financial stress tests for banks were seen as important for measuring the ability of large banks to withstand fu ture downside scenarios a number of participants em phasized that regulators should encourage banks to pre pare for possible downside scenarios by further limiting payouts to shareholders thereby preserving lossabsorb ing capital indeed historical loss models might under state losses in this context a few participants stressed that the activities of some nonbank financial institutions presented vulnerabilities to the financial system that could worsen in the event of a protracted economic downturn and that these institutions and activities should be monitored closely in their consideration of monetary policy at this meeting participants noted that the federal reserve was commit ted to using its full range of tools to support the us economy in this challenging time thereby promoting its maximum employment and price stability goals in light of their assessment that the ongoing public health crisis would weigh heavily on economic activity employment and inflation in the near term and posed considerable risks to the economic outlook over the medium term all participants judged that it would be appropriate to main tain the target range for the federal funds rate at to percent keeping the target range at the effective lower bound after quickly reducing it by basis points in march would continue to provide support to the economy and promote the committees maximum em ployment and price stability goals participants also judged that it would be appropriate to maintain the tar get range for the federal funds rate at its present level until policymakers were confident that the economy had weathered recent events and was on track to achieve the committees maximum employment and price stability goals participants also assessed that it was appropriate for the federal reserve to continue to purchase treasury secu rities and agency residentialmortgagebacked securities rmbs and cmbs in the amounts needed to support smooth market functioning these open market pur chases would continue to support the flow of credit to households and businesses and thereby foster the effec tive transmission of monetary policy to broader financial conditions in addition the desk would continue to of fer largescale overnight and term repo operations par ticipants noted that it was important to continue to mon itor market conditions closely and that the committee was prepared to adjust its plans as appropriate to support smooth functioning in the markets for these securities participants also commented that the multiple lending facilities established by the federal reserve under the authority of section of the federal reserve act and in some cases involving capital allocated by the treasury were supporting financial market functioning and the flow of credit to households businesses of all sizes and state and local governments in this way these emergency lending facilities were intended to help sup port the economy until pandemicrelated credit market disruptions had abated several participants commented further that it would be important for the federal re serve to remain ready to adjust these emergency lending facilities as appropriate based on its monitoring of finan cial market functioning and credit conditions page federal open market committee while participants agreed that the current stance of monetary policy remained appropriate they noted that the committee could at upcoming meetings further clarify its intentions with respect to its future monetary policy decisions some participants commented that the committee could make its forward guidance for the path for the federal funds rate more explicit for example the committee could adopt outcomebased forward guidance that would specify macroeconomic out comessuch as a certain level of the unemployment rate or of the inflation ratethat must be achieved be fore the committee would consider raising the target range for the federal funds rate the committee could also consider datebased forward guidance that would indicate that the target range could be raised only after a specified amount of time

the committees intentions several participants observed that the completion most likely later this year of the monetary policy framework review together with the announcement of the conclusions arising from the review would help further clarify the committees in tentions with respect to its future monetary policy ac tions several participants also remarked that the com mittee may need to provide further clarity regarding its intentions for purchases of treasury securities and agency mbs these participants noted that without fur ther communication on this matter uncertainty about the evolution of the federal reserves asset purchases could increase over time several participants remarked that a program of ongoing treasury securities purchases could be used in the future to keep longerterm yields low a few participants also noted that the balance sheet could be used to reinforce the committees forward guidance regarding the path of the federal funds rate through federal reserve purchases of treasury securi ties on a scale necessary to keep treasury yields at short to mediumterm maturities capped at specified levels for a period of time committee policy action in

meeting with an acknowledgment of the extraordinary and deeply troubling events of the last two weeks injustice prejudice and the callous dis regard for life had led to social unrest and a sense of des pair the chair noted that it was incumbent upon the leaders of the federal reserve system to continue to communicate with force and clarity about the federal reserves core values and to reaffirm its unflinching commitment to those values in pursuing the federal re serves mandated goals in that spirit the chair noted that he intended to offer the following remarks at the attended from the discussion of economic developments and the outlook through the end of tuesdays session page federal open market committee end of the postmeeting press conference all partici pants supported the statement affirming the federal re serves core values and its commitment to do everything it can to foster racial equality as well as diversity and in clusion both within the federal reserve system and in society more broadly i want to acknowledge the tragic events that have again put a spotlight on the pain of racial injustice in this country the federal reserve serves the entire nation we operate in and are part of many of the communities across the country where americans are grappling with and expressing themselves on issues of racial equality i speak for my colleagues throughout the fed eral reserve system when i say that there is no place at the federal reserve for racism and there should be no place for it in our society everyone deserves the opportunity to partici pate fully in our society and in our economy these foundational principles guide us in all we do from monetary policy to our focus on diver sity and inclusion in our workplace and to our work regulating and supervising banks to ensure fair access to credit around the country we will take this opportunity to renew our steadfast commitment to these principles making sure that we are playing our part we understand that the work of the federal re serve touches communities families and busi nesses across the country everything we do is in service to our public mission we are com mitted to using our full range of tools to support the economy and to help assure that the recov ery from this difficult period will be as robust as possible discussion of forward guidance asset purchases and yield curve caps or targets participants discussed tools for conducting monetary policy when the federal funds rate is at its effective lower bound elb the discussion addressed two topics the roles of forward guidance and largescale asset purchase programs in supporting the attainment of the committees maximumemployment and pricestability goals and in light of the foreign and historical expe rience with approaches that cap or target interest rates along the yield curve whether such approaches could be used to support forward guidance and complement asset purchase programs the staff briefing on the first topic focused on outcomebased forward guidance for the federal funds ratewhich ties changes in the target range for the federal funds rate to the achievement of specified macroeconomic outcomes such as reaching a given level of the unemployment rate or inflationand asset purchase programs of the kind used during and fol lowing the previous recession the staff presented re sults from model simulations that suggested that for ward guidance and largescale asset purchases can help support the labor market recovery and the return of in flation to the committees symmetric percent inflation goal the simulations suggested that the committee would have to maintain highly accommodative financial conditions for many years to quicken meaningfully the recovery from the current severe downturn the brief ing addressed factors that might alter the potency of for ward guidance and asset purchase programs along with a number of considerations for the design of these ac tions the staff cautioned that businesses and house holds might not be as forward looking as assumed in the model simulations which could reduce the effectiveness of policies that are predicated on influencing expecta tions about the path of policy several years into the fu ture alternatively prompt and forceful policy actions by the committee might help focus the publics expec tations around better outcomes or reduce perceived risks of worstcase scenarios which could generate more im mediate macroeconomic benefits than those featured in the staff analysis the second staff briefing reviewed the yield caps or tar gets yct policies that the federal reserve followed during and after world war ii and that the bank of ja pan and the reserve bank of australia are currently em ploying these three experiences illustrated different types of yct policies during world war ii the fed eral reserve capped yields across the curve to keep treasury borrowing costs low and stable since the bank of japan has targeted the year yield to continue to provide accommodation while limiting the potential for an excessive flattening of the yield curve and since march the reserve bank of australia has targeted the threeyear yield a target that is intended to reinforce the banks forward guidance for its policy rate and to in fluence funding rates across much of the australian economy the staff noted that these three experiences suggested that credible yct policies can control govern ment bond yields pass through to private rates and in the absence of exit considerations may not require large central bank purchases of government debt but the staff also highlighted the potential for yct policies to require the central bank to purchase very sizable minutes of the meeting of june page amounts of government debt under certain circum stancesa potential that was realized in the us experi ence in the sand the possibility that under yct policies monetary policy goals might come in conflict with public debt management goals which could pose risks to the independence of the central bank in their discussion of forward guidance and largescale asset purchases participants agreed that the committee has had extensive experience with these tools that they were effective in the wake of the previous recession that they have become key parts of the monetary policy toolkit and that as a result they have important roles to play in supporting the attainment of the committees maximumemployment and pricestability goals vari ous participants noted that the economy is likely to need support from highly accommodative monetary policy for some time and that it will be important in coming months for the committee to provide greater clarity re garding the likely path of the federal funds rate and asset purchases participants generally indicated support for outcomebased forward guidance a number of partici pants spoke favorably of forward guidance tied to infla tion outcomes that could possibly entail a modest tem porary overshooting of the committees longerrun in flation goal but where inflation fluctuations would be centered on percent over time they saw this form of forward guidance as helping reinforce the credibility of the committees symmetric percent inflation objective and potentially preventing a premature withdrawal of monetary policy accommodation a couple of partici pants signaled a preference for forward guidance tied to the unemployment rate noting that it would be more credible to focus on labor market outcomes that have been achieved in the recent past or thatgiven how high the unemployment rate currently issuch guidance would clearly signal a high degree of accommodation for an extended period a few others suggested that calendarbased guidancewhich specifies a date beyond which accommodation could start to be reducedmight be at least as effective as outcomebased guidance they noted that calendarbased guidance had been very effec tive when the committee used it in and or that it would be very challenging to provide credible out comebased guidance in light of the substantial uncer tainty surrounding the current economic outlook re gardless of the specific form of forward guidance a cou ple of participants expressed the concern that policies that effectively committed the committee to maintain ing very low interest rates for a long time could ulti mately pose significant risks to financial stability participants agreed that asset purchase programs can promote accommodative financial conditions by putting downward pressure on term premiums and longerterm yields several participants remarked that declines in the neutral rate of interest and in term premiums over the past decade and prevailing low levels of longerterm yields would likely act as constraints on the effectiveness of asset purchases in the current environment and noted that these constraints were not as acute when the com mittee implemented such programs in the wake of the global financial crisis these participants noted how ever that largescale asset purchases could still be bene ficial under current circumstances by offsetting potential upward pressures on longerterm yields or by helping re inforce the committees commitment to maintaining highly accommodative financial conditions a few par ticipants questioned the desirability of largescale asset purchases following the current purchases to support market functioning noting that they likely would lead to a further considerable expansion of the federal re serves balance sheet or have potentially adverse impli cations for financial stability in their discussion of the foreign and historical experi ence with yct policies and the potential role for such policies in the united states nearly all participants indi cated that they had many questions regarding the costs and benefits of such an approach among the three ep isodes discussed in the staff presentation participants generally saw the australian experience as most relevant for current circumstances in the united states none theless many participants remarked that as long as the committees forward guidance remained credible on its own it was not clear that there would be a need for the committee to reinforce its forward guidance with the adoption of a yct policy in addition participants raised a number of concerns related to the implementa tion of yct policies including how to maintain control of the size and composition of the federal reserves bal ance sheet particularly as the time to exit from such pol icies nears how to combine yct policieswhich at least in the australian case incorporate aspects of date based forward guidancewith the types of outcome based forward guidance that many participants favored how to mitigate the risks that yct policies pose to cen tral bank independence and how to assess the effects of these policies on financial market functioning and the size and composition of privatesector balance sheets a number of participants commented on additional chal lenges associated with yct policies focused on the longer portion of the yield curve including how these policies might interact with largescale asset purchase page federal open market committee programs and the extent of additional accommodation they would provide in the current environment of very low interest rates some of these participants also noted that longerterm yields are importantly influenced by factors such as longerrun inflation expectations and the longerrun neutral real interest rate and that changes in these factors or difficulties in estimating them could re sult in the central bank inadvertently setting yield caps or targets at inappropriate levels a couple of participants remarked that an appropriately designed yct policy that focused on the shorttomedium part of the yield curve could serve as a powerful commitment device for the committee these participants noted that even if mar ket participants currently expect the federal funds rate to remain at its elb through the medium term the intro duction of an effective yct policy could help prevent those expectations from changing prematurelyas hap pened during the previous recoveryor that the size of a largescale asset purchase program which also poses risks to central bank independence could be reduced by an effective yct policy all participants agreed that it would be useful for the staff to conduct further analysis of the design and implementation of yct policies as well as of their likely economic and financial effects a number of participants emphasized that when as sessing the potential roles that different monetary policy tools might play to support the attainment of the com mittees goals it was important to think about how var ious policy tools could be used in coordination as part of the committees overall strategy to achieve its dual mandate objectives in addition various participants noted that clear communications with the public are cen tral to the efficacy of all policy tools and that therefore the committee should complete its monetary policy framework review in the near term including revising the statement on longerrun goals and monetary pol icy strategy such a revised statement would communi cate to the public how the committee views its policy goals and provide additional context to the committees policy actions developments in financial markets and open mar ket operations the system open market account soma manager first discussed developments in financial markets over the intermeeting period risk asset prices were buoyed by optimism about the potential for increased economic activity associated with reopenings as parts of the united states and other countries relaxed lockdown restrictions that optimism was reinforced by highfrequency data suggesting a pickup in economic activity market partic ipants also pointed to the suite of us and global policy measures taken since midmarch as laying a foundation for the improvement in risk sentiment against this backdrop staff analysis suggested that equity prices had been supported by expectations for a strong rebound in earnings next year low riskfree rates and positive risk sentiment despite this improvement in risk sentiment market participants expected weak overall growth in and elevated uncertainties in the outlook re mained the manager noted that prospects for adverse developments regarding the coronavirus covid and the potential for financial strains to amplify reces sionary dynamics and geopolitical developments in cluding renewed uschina tensions presented near term risks to financial markets market participants were also attentive to the recent steepening in the treasury yield curve and noted a range of uncertainties in the out look for longerterm rates regarding expectations for monetary policy respond ents to the open market trading desks surveys sug gested that most market participants did not anticipate policy changes at the june meeting the target range for the federal funds rate was expected to remain at the elb for at least the next couple of years although many sur vey respondents attached some probability to the target range increasing in although the rates implied by federal funds futures contracts settling next year had fallen to slightly negative levels in may survey respond ents attached very little probability to the possibility of negative policy rates the manager turned to a discussion of federal reserve operations credit facilities some of which became op erational over the period generally experienced modest activity in light of broad improvements in credit market conditions new usage across many funding operations and facilities had declined over the intermeeting period as conditions in funding markets improved the man ager noted that a significant proportion of amounts out standing under us dollar liquidity swaps and repur chase agreements repo reflected term transactions ini tiated during the period of funding market strains in light of the improvement in funding market conditions the manager noted that it might be appropriate to make a modest adjustment to the minimum bid rates on repo operations in the forthcoming calendar which would ef fectively position these operations in a backstop role these adjustments were not expected to have any signif icant effects in shortterm funding markets finally the manager discussed the nearterm plans for purchases of treasury securities and agency mortgage backed securities mbs overall functioning in the minutes of the meeting of june page markets for these securities had improved substantially in light of these improvements the desk had gradually reduced the pace of purchases over the intermeeting pe riod to their current levels of billion per day in treas ury securities and billion per day in agency mbs these purchase amounts were significantly lower than the peak pace in midmarch and roughly corresponded to monthly increases in soma holdings of approxi mately billion in treasury securities and billion in agency mbs continuing to increase holdings at this pace would likely help sustain the improvements in mar ket functioning and seemed to be roughly in line with market expectations for treasury purchases and toward the lower end of expectations for agency mbs pur chases net of reinvestments in addition principal pay ments from agency debt and agency mbs held in the soma portfolio could continue to be reinvested in agency mbs weekly operations in agency commercial mortgagebacked securities cmbs would also be con ducted the desk was prepared to increase the size or adjust the composition of treasury agency mbs and agency cmbs purchases as needed to sustain smooth market functioning in the markets for these securities by unanimous vote the committee ratified the desks domestic transactions over the intermeeting period there were no intervention operations in foreign curren cies for the systems account during the intermeeting pe riod staff review of the economic situation the coronavirus outbreak and the measures undertaken to contain its spread were severely disrupting economic activity in the united states and abroad the available information for the june meeting suggested that us real gross domestic product gdp would likely post a historically large decline in the second quarter labor market conditions improved in may but these im provements were modest relative to the substantial de terioration seen over the previous two months con sumer price inflation as measured by the month per centage change in the price index for personal consump tion expenditures pce slowed notably through april reflecting the effects of both weak aggregate demand and low energy prices total nonfarm payroll employment expanded strongly in may though by much less than the historic job losses recorded in april the unemployment rate moved down to percent in may after soaring to percent in april as was highlighted by the bureau of labor sta tistics these figures likely understated the extent of un employment accounting for the unusually large number of workers who reported themselves as employed but absent from their jobs would have raised the unemploy ment rate by percentage points in april and percent age points in may both the labor force participation rate and the employmenttopopulation ratio increased in may initial claims for unemployment insurance ben efits had declined through the last week of may from their peak in late march but they still were at a histori cally elevated level average hourly earnings for all em ployees declined in may after rising sharply in april but these fluctuations largely reflected the substantial changes in the level and composition of employment which disproportionately affected lowerwage workers the employment cost index for total labor compensa tion in the private sector increased percent over the months ending in marcha period mostly predating the onset of the pandemicand was the same as its year earlier pace total pce price inflation was only percent over the months ending in april reflecting both weak aggre gate demand in recent months and a considerable drop in consumer energy prices prices fell in march and april in many categories that were affected the most by socialdistancing measures such as the prices for air travel and hotel accommodations core pce price in flation which excludes changes in consumer food and energy prices was percent over the months end ing in april in contrast the trimmed mean measure of month pce price inflation constructed by the fed eral reserve bank of dallas was percent in april the consumer price index cpi inched up percent over the months ending in may while core cpi infla tion was percent over the same period recent read ings on surveybased measures of longerrun inflation expectations were little changed on balance the uni versity of michigan surveys of consumers measure for the next to years edged up in may while the year ahead measure from the federal reserve bank of new yorks survey of consumer expectations was un changed the year measure for pce price inflation from the survey of professional forecasters ticked down in the second quarter all of these measures of longer run inflation expectations continued to be near their re cent ranges real pce slumped in april with declines widespread across most spending categories in may however light motor vehicle sales and some other highfrequency indi cators of consumer spending turned up but the levels of these indicators were mostly still below their levels early in the year real disposable personal income increased significantly in april as a marked decline in wage and page federal open market committee salary income was more than offset by a substantial boost from government transfer payments due to recent fiscal policy support as a result the personal saving rate soared the consumer sentiment measures from both the michigan survey and the conference board survey crept up in may but remained below their levels early in the year real residential investment appeared to be weakening significantly in the second quarter starts and building permit issuance for singlefamily homes along with starts of multifamily units dropped sharply in april sales of existing homes contracted markedly in april al though new home sales edged up real business fixed investment continued to tumble in the second quarter nominal new orders and shipments of nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft decreased considerably in april nominal business spending for nonresidential structures outside of the drilling and min ing sector also fell in april in addition the effects of low crude oil prices were evident in further declines in the number of crude oil and natural gas rigs in operation through early june an indicator of business spending on structures in the drilling and mining sector total industrial production plunged in april as many factories slowed or suspended operation in response to the coronavirus pandemic the decline in manufactur ing production was widespread across all major indus tries and was led by a collapse in the output of motor vehicles and related parts output in the mining sec torwhich includes crude oil extractionalso de creased reflecting the effects of low crude oil prices total real government purchases appeared to be rising moderately in the second quarter federal defense spending continued to increase in april and nondefense purchases were likely to be boosted in the second quar ter by recent fiscal policy measures related to the coro navirus in contrast state and local purchases looked to be declining as the payrolls of these governments shrank in april and may and nominal state and local construc tion expenditures decreased in april the nominal us international trade deficit widened in both march and april as exports of goods and services plunged more than imports the fall in goods exports was broad based with particularly sharp declines in au tomotive products industrial supplies and capital goods goods imports also contracted significantly in most categories through april and a near halt of inter national travel drove a steep decline in exports and im ports of services foreign economic activity contracted in the first quarter even though most countries abroad introduced strict socialdistancing measures to contain the spread of the coronavirus only toward the end of the quarter in china where restrictions were largely lifted by the end of the first quarter data pointed to a relatively quick re bound in economic activity in the second quarter out side of china indicators suggested that foreign eco nomic activity plummeted further in the second quarter notwithstanding some signs of improvement in may as restrictions started to ease inflation rates fell sharply across most foreign economies in april and may the low level of oil prices relative to a year ago contributed to month inflation rates close to or below zero in many advanced foreign economies afes staff review of the financial situation over the intermeeting period risk sentiment improved on net as optimism over reopening the economy po tential coronavirus treatments the unexpectedly positive may employment situation report and other indicators that suggest that economic activity may be rebounding more than offset concerns arising from otherwise dire economic data releases warnings from health experts that openings may have been premature and renewed tensions between the united states and china equity prices rose and corporate bond spreads narrowed nota bly the treasury yield curve steepened and the market implied expected path of the federal funds rate declined somewhat liquidity conditions continued to improve in general but some stress was still evident in several markets financing conditions were still somewhat strained for lowerrated borrowers and small businesses even as announcements and implementation of federal reserve facilities during the intermeeting period were supportive of credit flows the credit quality of busi nesses and municipal debt weakened the expected path of the federal funds rate for the next few years based on a straight read of overnight index swap quotes declined a bit and remained close to the elb through late marketimplied forward rates referring to and turned slightly negative for a few days beginning on may though market commen tary suggested that this development did not reflect in vestors expecting the fomc to lower the federal funds rate target range below zero this view was supported by federal reserve communications that negative inter est rates did not appear to be an attractive policy tool the treasury yield curve steepened over the intermeet ing period with year yields little changed while and year yields rose longerterm yields were likely minutes of the meeting of june page boosted by expectations of heavy upcoming treasury se curity issuance as well as some unwinding of safehaven demands in connection with improved investor senti ment the treasurys first year bond offering since was met with solid demand changes in inflation compensation based on treasury inflationprotected securities yields were mixed year inflation compensa tion rose amid the recent partial rebound in crude

appear to be a major drag on household spending issuance of consumer assetbacked securities resumed in midapril and in early may but remained significantly below prepandemic lev els staff economic outlook the projection for the us economy prepared by the staff for the june fomc meeting was downgraded on balance as compared with the april meeting forecast in response to information on the spread of the corona virus and changes in the measures undertaken to contain it both at home and abroad along with incoming eco nomic data us real gdp was forecast to show a his torically large decline in the second quarter of this year and the unemployment rate was expected to be sharply higher than in the first quarter the substantial fiscal policy measures and appreciable support from monetary policy along with the federal reserves liquidity and lending facilities were expected to help mitigate the de terioration in current economic conditions and to help boost the recovery the staff continued to judge that the future performance of the economy would depend importantly on the evo lution of the coronavirus outbreak and the measures un dertaken to contain it under the staffs baseline as sumptions that the current restrictions on social interac tions and business operations would continue to ease gradually this year real gdp was forecast to rise appre ciably and the unemployment rate to decline considera bly in the second half of the year although a complete recovery was not expected by yearend inflation was projected to weaken this year reflecting both the deteri oration in resource utilization and sizable expected de clines in consumer energy prices under the baseline as sumptions economic conditions were projected to con tinue to improve and inflation to pick back up over the next two years the staff still observed that the uncertainty related to the economic effects of the coronavirus pandemic was ex tremely elevated and that the historical behavior of the us economy in response to past economic shocks pro vided limited guidance for making judgments about how the economy might evolve in the future in light of the significant uncertainty and downside risks associated with the pandemic including how much the economy would weaken and how long it would take to recover the staff judged that a more pessimistic projection was no less plausible than the baseline forecast in this sce nario a second wave of the coronavirus outbreak with another round of strict limitations on social interactions and business operations was assumed to begin later this minutes of the meeting of june page year leading to a decrease in real gdp a jump in the unemployment rate and renewed downward pressure on inflation next year compared with the baseline the disruption to economic activity was more severe and protracted in this scenario with real gdp and inflation lower and the unemployment rate higher by the end of the mediumterm projection participants views on current conditions and the economic outlook in conjunction with this fomc meeting participants submitted their projections of the most likely outcomes for real gdp growth the unemployment rate and infla tion for each year from through and over the longer run based on their individual assessments of ap propriate monetary policyincluding the path for the federal funds rate the longerrun projections repre sented each participants assessment of the rate to which each variable would be expected to converge over time under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy these projections are described in the summary of economic projections which is an addendum to these minutes participants noted that the coronavirus outbreak was causing tremendous human and economic hardship across the united states and around the world the vi rus and the measures taken to protect public health in duced sharp declines in economic activity and a surge in job losses weaker demand and significantly lower oil prices were holding down consumer price inflation fi nancial conditions had improved in part reflecting pol icy measures to support the economy and the flow of credit to us households and businesses participants agreed that lowering the federal funds rate to its elb had established more accommodative finan cial conditions and that the federal reserves ongoing purchases of sizable quantities of treasury securities and agency mbs had helped restore smooth market func tioning to support the economy and the flow of credit to us households and businesses the fiscal response to economic developments had been large and timely and was providing much needed support for economic activity credit flows and economic activity were also being supported by the lending facilities established un der the authority of section of the federal reserve act with the approval of the secretary of the treasury participants judged that the effects of the coronavirus outbreak and the ongoing public health crisis will weigh heavily on economic activity employment and inflation in the near term and would pose considerable risks to the economic outlook over the medium term partici pants agreed that the data for the second quarter would likely show the largest decline in economic activity in postworld war ii history based in part on infor mation from their districts participants observed that the burdens of the present crisis were not falling equally on all americans and noted that the rise in joblessness was especially severe for lowerwage workers women african americans and hispanics participants agreed that recently enacted fiscal policy programs had been de livering valuable direct financial aid to households busi nesses and communities as well as providing relief to disadvantaged groups regarding household spending participants pointed to information from district contacts to surveys of con sumer behavior and to highfrequency indicatorssuch as credit card transactions automated teller machine vis its and cellphone data trackingas suggesting that con sumer expenditures may be stabilizing or rebounding modestly limited available sources of standard eco nomic data such as retail purchases and motor vehicle sales also seemed in line with this impression with sup portive monetary policy and payments to households under the cares act coronavirus aid relief and economic security act including enhanced unemploy ment insurance payments participants expected per sonal consumption expenditures to grow strongly in the second half of the year albeit from very low levels however the recovery in consumer spending was not expected to be particularly rapid beyond this year with voluntary social distancing precautionary saving and lower levels of employment and income restraining the pace of expansion over the medium term participants noted that levels of uncertainty and risks perceived by businesses remained high and that these factors continued to contribute to restraints on capital expenditures despite easing in financing conditions stemming in part from recent policy measures some business contacts pointed to halting improvements in consumer demand a dearth in public infrastructure pro jects due to strained state and local government budget conditions or the decline in energy prices as factors likely to depress business spending some participants also noted reports of firms stating that they have had some challenges in rehiring employees in part related to temporary enhanced unemployment insurance benefits participants generally agreed that practices and develop ments in public health to address the pandemic would be critical for ensuring a strong and lasting reopening of businesses and reducing the likelihood of an outsized wave of closures but monetary policy and especially page federal open market committee fiscal policy would play important roles nevertheless participants concluded that voluntary social distancing and structural shifts stemming from the pandemic would likely mean that some proportion of businesses would close permanently noting ongoing changes in the com position of production and the processes by which pro duction takes place participants suggested that some business adaptations were likely to endure long after the coronavirus subsides resulting in notable dislocation and sectoral reallocation of firms and workers across in dustries participants noted that conditions in the energy sector remained difficult amid stilllow oil prices several par ticipants anticipated continued low drilling activity at least until excess inventories were reduced later this year and expressed concern that a wave of bankruptcies in the energy sector could be forthcoming in addition the agricultural sector continued to be under stress due to low prices for some farm commodities reduced ethanol production and pandemicrelated limitations on pro duction for some food processing plants with regard to the labor market participants remarked on the surprisingly positive news from the labor market report for may but emphasized that nearly million jobs had been lost on net since february participants noted that because of misclassification errors in the cur rent population survey the official unemployment rate for may likely understated the extent of unemployment others observed that government reliance on unemploy ment insurance as a vehicle for income support under the cares act complicates the interpretation of the data participants also noted that unemployment insur ance claims continued to run at a historically elevated level but the proportion of laidoff workers who ex pected to be recalled was unusually large taken to gether the data suggested that april could turn out to be the trough of the recession but participants agreed that it was too early to draw any firm conclusions prospects for further substantial improvement in the la bor market were seen as depending on a sustained reo pening of the economy which in turn depended in large part on the efficacy of health measures taken to limit the effects of the coronavirus on this issue participants judged there to be a great deal of uncertainty and ex pressed concerns about the possibility that an early reo pening would contribute to a significant increase of in fections participants also regarded highly accommoda tive monetary policy and sustained support from fiscal policy as likely to be needed to facilitate a durable recov ery in labor market conditions overall participants ex pected that a full recovery in employment would take some time with regard to inflation participants reiterated their view that the negative effect from the pandemic on ag gregate demand was likely to more than offset any up ward pressure from supply constraints so that the overall effect of the outbreak on prices was seen as disinflation ary consistent with that interpretation participants ob served the recent negative readings on the monthly cpi and noted that they anticipated that the month pce inflation measure would likely run well below the com mittees percent objective for some time observing that inflation had been running somewhat below the committees percent longerrun objective before the coronavirus outbreak some participants noted a risk that longterm inflation expectations might deteriorate participants noted that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy would likely be needed for some time to achieve the percent inflation objective over the longer run participants commented that there remained an extraor dinary amount of uncertainty and considerable risks to the economic outlook participants shared views on possible outcomes for the reopening of the economy the prospects for effective voluntary social distancing and the efficacy of public health initiatives for their im plications for economic activity and employment a number of participants judged that there was a substan tial likelihood of additional waves of outbreaks which in some scenarios could result in further economic dis ruptions and possibly a protracted period of reduced economic activity other possibilities included eco nomic activity that might recover more quickly if sizable widespread outbreaks could be avoided even as house holds and businesses relax or modify socialdistancing behaviors among the other sources of risk noted by participants were that fiscal support for households businesses and state and local governments might prove to be insufficient and that foreign economies could come under greater pressure than anticipated as a result of the spread of the pandemic abroad participants stressed that measures taken in the areas of healthcare policy and fiscal policy together with actions by house holds and businesses would shape the prospects for a prompt and timely return of the us economy to more normal conditions in addition participants agreed that recent actions taken by the federal reserve had helped reduce risks to the economic outlook minutes of the meeting of june page as part of their discussions of longerrun risks partici pants noted that in some adverse scenarios more busi ness closures would occur and workers would experi ence longer spells of unemployment that could lead to a loss of skills that could impair their employment pro spects in addition to the extent that transmission mitigation procedures adopted by firms reduced their productivity or if the reallocation of industry output re sulted in a lasting reduction in business investment the longerrun level of potential output could be reduced regarding developments in financial markets partici pants agreed that ongoing actions by the federal re serve including those undertaken in collaboration with the treasury had helped ease strains in some financial markets and supported the flow of credit to households businesses and communities measures of market func tioning in the markets for treasury securities and agency mbs had improved substantially since march strains in shortterm funding markets had receded as well and the volume of borrowing at many of the federal reserves liquidity facilities had moved lower as borrowers re turned to market sources of funding risk spreads across a range of fixedincome markets had narrowed as the intense flight to safety witnessed in financial markets in the spring ebbed further in their consideration of monetary policy at this meeting participants reaffirmed that the federal reserve was committed to using its full range of tools to support the us economy in this challenging time thereby promot ing its maximumemployment and pricestability goals in light of their assessment that the ongoing public health crisis would weigh heavily on economic activity employment and inflation in the near term and posed considerable risks to the economic outlook over the me dium term all participants judged that it would be ap propriate to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at to percent keeping the target range at the elb would continue to provide support to the economy and promote the committees maximum employment and pricestability goals participants also judged that it would be appropriate to maintain the tar get range for the federal funds rate at its present level until policymakers were confident that the economy had weathered recent events and was on track to achieve the committees maximumemployment and pricestability goals participants also agreed that to support the flow of credit to households and businesses over coming months it would be appropriate for the federal reserve to increase its holdings of treasury securities and agency mbs and agency cmbs at least at the current pace to sustain smooth market functioning thereby fostering ef fective transmission of monetary policy to broader fi nancial conditions in addition the desk would con tinue to offer largescale overnight and term repo oper ations participants noted that it would be important to continue to monitor developments closely and that the committee would be prepared to adjust its plans as ap propriate participants also commented that the lending facilities established by the federal reserve under the authority of section of the federal reserve act were sup porting financial market functioning and the flow of credit to households businesses of all sizes and state and local governments several participants commented further that it would be important for the federal re serve to remain ready to adjust these emergency lending facilities as appropriate based on its monitoring of finan cial market functioning and credit conditions participants agreed that the current stance of monetary policy remained appropriate but many noted that the committee could at upcoming meetings further clarify its intentions with respect to its future monetary policy decisions as the economic outlook becomes clearer in particular most participants commented that the com mittee should communicate a more explicit form of for ward guidance for the path of the federal funds rate and provide more clarity regarding purchases of treasury se curities and agency mbs as more information about the trajectory of the economy becomes available a number of participants judged that it was important for forward guidance and asset purchases to be structured in a way that provides the accommodation necessary to support rapid economic recovery and fosters a durable return of inflation and inflation expectations to levels consistent with the committees symmetric percent objective many participants remarked that the completion of the monetary policy framework review together with the announcement of the conclusions arising from the re view and the release of a revised committee statement on its goals and policy strategy would help clarify further how the committee intends to conduct monetary policy going forward committee policy action in their discussion of monetary policy for this meeting members agreed that the coronavirus outbreak was caus ing tremendous human and economic hardship across the united states and around the world the virus and the measures taken to

pce inflation which excludes food and energy generally followed a trajectory similar to the pro jections for total inflation as shown in figure almost all participants indicated that their

as weighted to the downside no participant assessed the risks to his or her inflation outlook as weighted to the upside in discussing the uncertainty and risks surrounding their economic projections

seen as potential downside risks to the economic outlook and fasterthan anticipated progress in responding to or treating the coronavirus were seen as potential upside risks partici pants also mentioned a number of other unknowns and risk factors related to the outlook including the extent of supplyside disruptions possible changes in house hold behavior the degree to which business bankrupt cies might cause dislocations the extent of fiscal policy support and possibly depressed foreign demand given the global nature of the pandemic several participants also expressed concerns about longerrun issues in the event of a prolonged recession such as labor market scarring if the unemployment rate remained elevated and inflation persistently undershooting the fomcs per cent inflation objective participants assessments of the appropriate future path of the federal funds rate are also subject to considerable uncertainty because the committee adjusts monetary policy in response to actual and prospective develop ments over time in key economic variablessuch as real gdp growth the unemployment rate and inflation uncertainty surrounding the projected path for the fed eral funds rate importantly reflects the uncertainties about the paths for these economic variables along with other factors as with the macroeconomic variables the forecast uncertainty surrounding the appropriate path of the federal funds rate is substantial previous sep addendums to the fomc minutes contained figures showing the median projections along with confi dence intervals based on historical forecast errors because the level of uncertainty about the economic outlook is cur rently judged to be higher than its historical average as a result of uncertainty about the course of the

governors and the presidents of the federal reserve banks inform discussions of mon etary policy among policymakers and can aid public un derstanding of the basis for policy actions considera ble uncertainty attends these projections however the economic and statistical models and relationships used to help produce economic forecasts are necessarily im perfect descriptions of the real world and the future path of the economy can be affected by myriad unfore seen developments and events thus in setting the stance of monetary policy participants consider not only what appears to be the most likely economic out come as embodied in their projections but also the range of alternative possibilities the likelihood of their occurring and the potential costs to the economy should they occur table summarizes the average historical accuracy of a range of forecasts including those reported in past monetary policy reports and those prepared by the federal reserve boards staff in advance of meetings of the fed eral open market committee fomc the projection error ranges shown in the table illustrate the considera ble uncertainty associated with economic forecasts for example suppose a participant projects that real gross domestic product gdp and total consumer prices will rise steadily at annual rates of respectively percent and percent if the uncertainty attending those pro jections is similar to that experienced in the past and the risks around the projections are broadly balanced the numbers reported in table would imply a probability of about percent that actual gdp would expand within a range of to percent in the current year to percent in the second year and to per cent in the third year the corresponding percent confidence intervals for overall inflation would be to percent in the current year and to percent in the second and third years because current conditions may differ from those that prevailed on average over history participants provide judgments as to whether the uncertainty attached to their projections of each economic variable is greater than smaller than or broadly similar to typical levels of forecast uncertainty seen in the past years as presented in ta ble that is participants judge whether each economic variable is more likely to be above or below their projec tions of the most likely outcome these judgments about the uncertainty and the risks attending each participants projections are distinct from the diversity of participants views about the most likely outcomes forecast uncer tainty is concerned with the risks associated with a partic ular projection rather than with divergences across a num ber of different projections as with real activity and in flation the outlook for the future path of the federal funds rate is subject to considerable uncertainty this uncer tainty arises primarily because each participants assess ment of the appropriate stance of monetary policy de pends importantly on the evolution of real activity and in flation over time if economic conditions evolve in an un expected manner then assessments of the appropriate set ting of the federal funds rate would change from that point forward the final line in table shows the error ranges for forecasts of shortterm interest rates they suggest that the historical confidence intervals associated with pro jections of the federal funds rate are quite wide it should be noted however that these confidence intervals are not strictly consistent with the projections for the federal funds rate as these projections are not forecasts of the most likely quarterly outcomes but rather are projections of par ticipants individual assessments of appropriate monetary policy and are on an endofyear basis however the fore cast errors should provide a sense of the uncertainty around the future path of the federal funds rate generated by the uncertainty about the macroeconomic variables as well as additional adjustments to monetary policy that would be appropriate to offset the effects of shocks to the economy summary of economic projections of the meeting of june page

potential changes to the com mittees statement on longerrun goals and monetary policy strategy participants agreed that in light of fun damental changes in the economy over the past dec adeincluding generally lower levels of interest rates and persistent disinflationary pressures in the united states and abroadand given what has been learned during the monetary policy framework review refining the statement could be helpful in increasing the trans parency and accountability of monetary policy such re finements could also facilitate wellinformed deci sionmaking by households and businesses and as a re sult better position the committee to meet its maxi mumemployment and pricestability objectives partic ipants noted that the statement on longerrun goals and monetary policy strategy serves as the foundation for the committees policy actions and that it would be important to finalize all changes to the statement in the near future developments in financial markets and open mar ket

equity price indexes attended the discussion of developments in financial mar kets and open market operations attended tuesdays session only page federal open market committee were roughly flat even as concerns about the resurgence in the coronavirus covid in the united states grew at the same time treasury yields and other sov ereign yields declined and the us dollar weakened overall volatility remained subdued relative to recent periods while the sp index was little changed the effect of renewed outbreaks was evident in the differentiated performance across sp industry sectors virussensi tive sectors and firms with weaker fundamentals under performed over the period as they had over the broader pandemic episode airline and hotel share prices de clined sharply and share prices of bankswhich faced earnings pressures from large loan loss provisions and compressed net interest marginscontinued to under perform as the soma manager highlighted the sp index has been supported by its significant share of technology firms many of which have been relatively re silient to virus containment measures in contrast smaller firms not well represented in the sp may be experiencing greater effects on their businesses due to the virusa possibility consistent with the underper formance of the broader russell index over the in termeeting period the marketimplied path of the federal funds rate shifted down modestly over the intermeeting period the cor responding path implied by responses to the open mar ket desks survey of primary dealers and survey of market participants also fell as the probabilities placed on rate hikes next year and in declined market pricing suggested that the federal funds rate was ex pected to first rise above the current target range in that timing was broadly consistent with survey respond ents expectations regarding the timing of the first in crease in the target range although the range of survey responses was wide the soma manager noted that survey responses suggested that the dispersion in views about the timing of a rate increase might be related to differing views about the economic conditions that would prevail when the fomc first lifted the target range as survey respondents views about those condi tions were also dispersed the soma manager reported that market functioning across a number of market segments remained stable at significantly improved levels in treasury and agency mortgagebacked securities mbs markets many mar the approved fima desk resolution which updates the march resolution with a new expiration date is

swap spreads were also steady federal reserve repur chase agreements repos outstanding fell from bil lion to zero over the intermeeting period with the tim ing of the overnight operations now having shifted to the afternoon when most trading activity in the repo market is complete and with minimum bid rates above the ioer rate repo operations had been effectively po sitioned in a backstop role for the time being as term us dollar liquidity swaps matured the amounts out standing fell to around billion less than a third of the peak reached in late may in light of improved conditions across these markets the federal reserves balance sheet declined over the in termeeting period from trillion to trillion the decline was driven by the reductions in repo and us dollar liquidity swaps outstanding these reductions more than offset ongoing purchases of treasury securi ties and agency mbs the manager discussed a proposal to extend the tempo rary us dollar liquidity swap arrangements as well as the temporary fima foreign and international mone tary authorities repo facility through march of next year keeping these arrangements in place would help sustain recent improvements in global dollar funding markets and support smooth functioning of the us treasury market under the proposal provided that the committee had no objections the chair would approve the extension of the

the coronavirus outbreak and the measures undertaken to contain its spread continued to have substantial ef fects on economic activity in the united states and abroad the information available at the time of the july meeting suggested that us economic activ ity had picked up in may and june following sharp de clines in march and april measured on a quarterly basis however it appeared that real gross domestic product gdp had decreased at a historically rapid rate in the second quarter labor market conditions improved con siderably in june but the improvements over may and june were modest relative to the substantial deteriora tion seen in march and april consumer price infla tionas measured by the month percentage change in the price index for personal consumption expendi tures pce through mayremained well below the rates that prevailed early in the year total nonfarm payroll employment expanded robustly in june as it did in may but the gains in those two months offset only about onethird of the jobs lost in march and april the unemployment rate moved down further to percent but it continued to be far above its level at the beginning of the year the unemployment rates for african americans asians and hispanics de clined on balance over the past two months but re mained well above the national average both the labor force participation rate and the employmenttopopula tion ratio increased further in june initial claims for un employment insurance benefits continued to decrease on net through the middle of july but the pace of de clines had slowed in recent weeks in addition weekly estimates of privatesector payrolls constructed by the boards staff using data provided by the payroll proces sor adp along with some other highfrequency measuressuch as employment at small businesses and job postingssuggested that employment gains had slowed since midjune but likely were still strong total pce price inflation was percent over the months ending in may reflecting both weak aggre gate demand and a considerable drop in consumer en ergy prices core pce price inflation which excludes changes in consumer food and energy prices was percent over the same month period in contrast the trimmed mean measure of month pce price in flation constructed by the federal reserve bank of dal las was percent in may the consumer price index cpi increased percent over the months ending in june while core cpi inflation was percent over the same period on a monthly basis the available data indicated that consumer pricesas measured by the pce price index in may and the cpi in junehad turned up after having fallen in march and april this re bound was evident in many price categories that were most affected by socialdistancing measures recent readings on surveybased measures of longerrun infla tion expectations were little changed on balance the university of michigan surveys of consumers measure for the next to years was unchanged on net from may to early july the threeyearahead measure from the federal reserve bank of new yorks survey of con sumer expectations edged down in june but remained within its recent range real pce rebounded robustly in may with particularly strong growth in spending for consumer goods but more moderate gains in expenditures for consumer services in june the components of retail sales used by the bu reau of economic analysis to estimate pce along with light motor vehicle sales increased further overall however real consumer spending remained well below the levels that prevailed at the beginning of the year moreover recent highfrequency indicators of spending on many consumer servicessuch as restaurant dining hotel accommodations and air travelremained very subdued real disposable personal income fell back in may primarily reflecting the waning of the substantial boost that federal stimulus payments had provided in april however wage and salary income increased strongly in may though to a level still below its february value and unemployment insurance benefits continued to be substantial leaving the personal saving rate quite elevated the consumer sentiment measures from both the michigan survey and the conference board survey improved notably in june but fell back somewhat in july housingsector activity bounced back strongly in recent months likely boosted in part by the effects of low in terest rates starts and building permit issuance for sin glefamily homes along with starts of multifamily units increased significantly over may and june however page federal open market committee these construction measures were still below their pre pandemic levels sales of existing homes rose substan tially over those two months and new home sales also moved up on net indicators of business fixed investment suggested that investment had generally not begun to recover but that the pace of declines had moderated on balance in re cent months nominal new orders and shipments of nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft increased in may and june but they remained below their levels at the beginning of the year while some measures of busi ness sentiment improved nominal business spending on nonresidential structures outside of the drilling and mining sector declined further in may and the number of crude oil and natural gas rigs in operationan indica tor of business spending on structures in the drilling and mining sectorcontinued to decrease through late july industrial production expanded briskly in may and june as many factories reopened or ramped up production the surge in manufacturing production was led by ap preciable gains in the output of motor vehicles and re lated parts following extended automaker shutdowns from midmarch through april in contrast output in the mining sectorwhich includes crude oil extrac tiondecreased further reflecting the effects of still low crude oil prices total real government purchases appeared to have in creased moderately on balance in the second quarter federal defense spending continued to rise through june and nondefense purchases were likely boosted in the second quarter by fiscal policy measures taken in re sponse to the coronavirus in contrast state and local purchases looked to have declined markedly as the pay rolls of these governments shrank further in june and nominal state and local construction expenditures de creased on net over april and may the nominal us international trade deficit widened in may relative to april as exports decreased more than imports the fall in exports was broad based across goods categories while lower imports of automotive products more than offset higher imports of consumer goods and industrial supplies following aprils historic plunge exports and imports of services fell a bit further in may driven by the continued suspension of most in ternational travel preliminary data for june showed some recovery in nominal goods exports and imports altogether the available data suggested that net exports were a significant drag on the rate of change in real gdp in the second quarter incoming data suggested that foreign economic activity plunged in the second quarter as a result of the corona virus pandemic and the measures undertaken to contain it there were also signs that many foreign economies started to recover over the past few months as re strictions were gradually eased in china where eco nomic activity had collapsed in the first quarter and re strictions were rolled back earlier than elsewhere the preliminary gdp release showed that the economy bounced back strongly in the second quarter in the euro area and other advanced foreign economies recent data on industrial production and to a lesser extent con sumer spending showed a partial recovery in may and june however continued uncertainty about the course of the virus was underscored by the fact that some emerging market economies were struggling to control the pandemic while some other countries that previ ously contained the virus were experiencing flareups of new infections inflation rates continued to fall in most foreign economies through june because of low energy prices and weak demand and measures of inflation ex pectations remained subdued staff review of the financial situation amid sizable fluctuations changes in asset prices over the intermeeting period were mixed on net financial market sentiment was boosted by betterthanexpected economic data for the united states china and europe however the boost to sentiment appeared to have been offset

clined and the yield curve flattened corporate and mu nicipal bond spreads narrowed and the dollar weakened somewhat liquidity conditions continued to normalize but had not returned to their prepandemic levels in sev eral markets over the intermeeting period yields on nominal treas ury securities fell and the yield curve flattened on net yields declined somewhat at the start of the intermeeting period following the moreaccommodativethanex pected june fomc communications the further de cline in yields that occurred over subsequent weeks likely reflected concerns about the surge in confirmed corona virus cases across many parts of the united states measures of inflation compensation based on treasury inflation protected securities maturing over the next few years continued to rebound from their sharp drop in midmarch the rebound was reportedly driven primar ily by investors interpretation of recent economic data which suggested that the risk of deflation had abated minutes of the meeting of july page somewhat as well as by some improvement in market liquidity despite the uptick both the year and year measures of inflation compensation remained below their prepandemic levels the expected path of the fed eral funds rate based on a straight read of overnight in dex swap quotes declined modestly and stayed close to the effective lower bound at least through the first half of marketimplied forward rates referring to and remained slightly negative however market commentary suggested that investors generally did not expect the fomc to lower the federal funds target

to firms of all sizes in the second quarter standards were reported to be at the tighter end of their range since a marked change from a year ago ci loans on banks balance sheets contracted sig nificantly in june reflecting paydowns of the record draws on credit lines seen in previous months as well as low originations page federal open market committee credit quality of nonfinancial corporations deteriorated further over the intermeeting period with a sizable vol ume of speculativegrade debt downgraded in june de faults in may reached their highest singlemonth volume since and june defaults were high as well market indicators of future default expectations also deterio rated somewhat municipal market financing conditions remained accommodative although the credit quality of municipal debt continued to show signs of weakness financing conditions for small businesses remained tight banks reported in the july sloos that the level of standards for small businesses was at the tighter end of the range since at the same time the credit needs of small businesses remained high as the prospect arose of many businesses having to shut down opera tions again in response to rising coronavirus cases small business loan performance deteriorated significantly shortterm delinquencies were comparable with levels seen in early amid tighter lending standards and high credit demand advances via the paycheck protec tion program lending facility continued to grow over the intermeeting period in early july the main street lending program became fully operational financing conditions for commercial real estate cre particularly those in capital markets recovered further over the intermeeting period spreads on nonagency commercial mortgagebacked securities cmbs contin ued to decline in june while issuance of nonagency cmbs continued to show signs of moderate recovery in may and june spreads on agency cmbs remained at prepandemic levels and agency cmbs issuance was strong in contrast bank lending standards for cre loans tightened further according to the july sloos and cre loan growth at banks slowed the credit qual ity of existing cre loans continued to deteriorate as fur ther signs of repayment difficulties emerged most nota bly in the lodging and retail sectors financing conditions in the residential mortgage market were generally unchanged over the intermeeting period the spread between the primary mortgage rate and mbs yields remained wide reflecting capacity constraints at loan originators increased origination costs and de creases in the value of servicing rights credit continued to flow to borrowers with higher credit scores seeking mortgages that met standard conforming loan criteria and low mortgage interest rates supported elevated refi nancing activity financing conditions remained tight however for borrowers with relatively low credit scores and for those seeking nonconforming mortgages the july sloos and other surveys of mortgage market con ditions suggested that both bank and nonbank lenders tightened standards in the second quarter the credit quality of mortgages did not appear to deteriorate fur ther over the period financing conditions for consumer credit tightened a bit further during the intermeeting period in the credit card market lending standards at commercial banks tightened further according to the july sloos in con trast conditions in the auto loan market appeared to be little changed on balance with those for subprime bor rowers remaining tight conditions in the consumer as setbacked securities abs markets were stable during the intermeeting period yield spreads for certain highly rated credit card and auto loan abs stabilized at pre pandemic levels while student and auto loan abs issu ance recovered to a prepandemic pace consumer credit quality remained stable partly due to forbearance programs the staff provided an update on its assessment of the stability of the financial system and on balance charac terized the financial vulnerabilities of the us financial system as notable while noting an unusually high level of uncertainty associated with this assessment the staff judged that asset valuation pressures were notable in particular highyield and investmentgrade corporate bond spreads were within historical norms and com mercial real estate prices were continuing to increase de spite rising vacancy rates the staff assessed vulnerabil ities due to nonfinancial leverage to have risen from moderate to notable reflecting declines in household in comes and business profits such declines implied less resilient borrowers the expected sharp decline in sec ondquarter real gdp would likely result in a rise in the ratio of household debt to nominal gdp the ratio of business debt to nominal gdp rose in the first quarter from levels that were already historically highamid de clining profits and deteriorating credit qualityalthough low interest rates had helped ease firms debt servicing burdens the staff assessed vulnerabilities arising from financial leverage to have increased from low to moder ate citing uncertainty about losses connected to business loans for banks and a higher weight on vulnerabilities connected to leverage at nonbank financial institutions vulnerabilities associated with maturity and liquidity transformation were characterized as moderate and the staff noted that federal reserve facilities reduced these vulnerabilities at nonbanks minutes of the meeting of july page staff economic outlook in the us economic projection prepared by the staff for the july fomc meeting the estimated level of real gdp in the second quarter was marked up compared with the june meeting forecast reflecting the better thanexpected data through june nevertheless eco nomic activity still appeared to have declined at a histor ically rapid rate in the second quarter the projected rate of recovery in real gdp and the pace of declines in the unemployment rate over the second half of this year were expected to be somewhat less robust than in the previous forecast although the staff assumed that ad ditional fiscal stimulus measures would be enacted be yond those anticipated in the june forecast the positive effect on the economic outlook was outweighed some what by the staffs assessment of the likely effects of sev eral other factors those factors included the increasing spread of the coronavirus in the united states since mid june the reactions of many states and localities in slow ing or scaling back the reopening of their economies es pecially for businesses such as restaurants and bars providing services that entail personal interactions and some highfrequency indicators that pointed to a decel eration in economic activity substantial fiscal policy measuresboth enacted and anticipatedalong with appreciable support from monetary policy and the fed eral reserves liquidity and lending facilities were ex pected to continue bolstering the economic recovery although a complete recovery was not expected by year end inflation was projected to remain subdued this year reflecting the substantial amount of slack in re source utilization and the sizable declines in consumer energy prices earlier this year the staffs baseline as sumptions were that the current restrictions on social in teractions and business operations along with voluntary social distancing by individuals would ease gradually through next year as a result the rate of real gdp growth was projected to exceed potential output growth the unemployment rate was expected to decline consid erably and inflation was forecast to pick back up over and the staff continued to observe that the uncertainty re lated to the economic effects of the pandemic was ex tremely elevated and that the unusual nature of the pan demicrelated shock made assessments about how the economy might evolve in the future more challenging than usual in light of the significant uncertainty and downside risks associated with the course of the pan demic and how long it would take the economy to re cover the staff still judged that a more pessimistic pro jection was no less plausible than the baseline forecast in this alternative scenario an acceleration of the coro navirus outbreak with another round of strict limita tions on social interactions and business operations was assumed to begin later this year leading to a decrease in real gdp a jump in the unemployment rate and re newed downward pressure on inflation next year com pared with the baseline the disruption to economic ac tivity was more severe and protracted in this scenario with real gdp and inflation lower and the unemploy ment rate higher by the end of the mediumterm projec tion participants views on current conditions and the economic outlook participants noted that the coronavirus pandemic was causing tremendous human and economic hardship across the united states and around the world follow ing sharp declines economic activity and employment had picked up somewhat in recent months but remained well below levels at the beginning of the year weaker demand and significantly lower oil prices were holding down consumer price inflation overall financial condi tions had improved in recent months in part reflecting policy measures to support the economy and the flow of credit to us households and businesses participants agreed that the path of the economy would depend on the course of the virus which was seen as highly uncer tain participants noted that the rebound in consumer spend ing from its trough in april had been particularly strong resumption in economic activity as well as payments to households under the coronavirus aid relief and eco nomic security cares act had supported household income and consumer expenditures participants ob served that with this rebound household spending likely had recovered about half of its previous decline con sumers purchases of goodsincluding motor vehicles other durables and especially goods sold onlinehad bounced back much more than their purchases of ser vices such as air travel hotel accommodations and res taurant meals which were disrupted significantly by so cial distancing and other effects of the virus with re gard to the behavior of household spending in recent weeks participants pointed to information from district contacts and highfrequency indicators such as credit and debit card transactions and mobility indicators based on cellphone location tracking as suggesting that in creases in some consumer expenditures had likely slowed in reaction to the further spread of the virus participants noted that households spending on discre page federal open market committee tionary servicessuch as leisure travel and hospital itywould likely be subdued for some time and thus would be a factor restraining the pace of recovery in contrast to the sizable rebound in consumer spend ing participants saw less improvement in the business sector in recent months and they noted that their dis trict business contacts continued to report extraordinar ily high levels of uncertainty and risks several partici pants relayed examples of some operational difficulties their business contacts were reportedly facing in the cur rent environment these difficulties included managing disruptions in supply chains challenges associated with closure and reopening and elevated employee absentee ism in some cases furthermore some participants noted that small businesses were under significant strain also further nearterm fiscal support was uncertain participants noted that in light of conditions in the busi ness sector business investment spending continued to be subdued participants generally agreed that actions of consumers and businesses in taking steps to slow the spread of the virus along with developments in public health would be critical in ensuring a durable reopening of businesses in addition monetary policy and particu larly fiscal policy would also play important roles in sup porting business activity several participants also commented on ongoing chal lenges facing the energy or farm sector despite recent improvements in the energy sector these challenges in cluded stilllow oil demand excess inventories and low oil prices while in the farm sector they included low prices of some farm commodities pandemicrelated dis ruptions in some food processing plants and a signifi cant decline in demand for ethanol regarding the labor market many participants com mented that the pace of employment gains which was quite strong in may and june had likely slowed the increasing number of virus cases in many parts of the country had led to delays in some business reopenings and to some reclosures as well the pace of declines in initial unemployment insurance claims had slowed in re cent weeks and claims remained at an elevated level in addition participants emphasized that the labor market was a long way from a full recovery even after the posi tive may and june employment reports these reports in dicated that through june only about onethird of the roughly million loss in jobs that occurred over march and april had been offset by subsequent gains partici pants generally agreed that prospects for further sub stantial improvement in the labor market would depend on a broad and sustained reopening of businesses in turn such a reopening would depend in large part on the efficacy of health measures taken to limit the spread of the virus participants also discussed the nature of the current sit uation in the labor market they noted that the down turn in employment was concentrated among lower wage and servicesector workers many of whom were employed in industries most adversely affected by social distancing measures and with lowerwage and service sector jobs disproportionately held by african ameri cans hispanics and women these portions of the pop ulation were bearing a disproportionate share of the eco nomic hardship caused by the pandemic participants noted that the fiscal support initiated in the spring through the cares act had been very important in granting some financial relief to millions of families a number of participants observed that with some provi sions of the cares act set to expire shortly against the backdrop of a stillweak labor market additional fiscal aid would likely be important for supporting vulnerable families and thus the economy more broadly in the pe riod ahead in their comments about inflation participants generally judged that the negative effect of the pandemic on ag gregate demand was more than offsetting upward pres sures on some prices stemming from supply constraints or from higher demand for certain products so that the overall effect of the pandemic on prices was seen as dis inflationary recent low monthly readings of pce prices suggested that the month change measure of pce price inflation would likely continue to run well below the committees percent objective for some time against this backdrop a few participants noted a risk that longerterm inflation expectations might move be low levels consistent with the committees symmetric percent objective participants also noted that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy would likely be needed for some time to support aggregate demand and achieve percent inflation over the longer run participants observed that many measures of financial market functioning were indicating that improvements achieved since the extreme turbulence in march had been sustained actions by the federal reserve includ ing emergency lending facilities established with ap proval of and in many cases financial support from the treasury had helped ease the strains in some finan cial markets seen earlier in the year and were supporting the flow of credit to households businesses and com munities participants observed that the volume of bor minutes of the meeting of july page rowing in recent months at many of the federal re serves liquidity facilities had stayed low reflecting im proved availability of funding from market sources and participants agreed that the federal reserves ongoing provision of backstop credit in various forms continued to be important to sustain the market improvements al ready achieved participants observed that uncertainty surrounding the economic outlook remained very elevated with the path of the economy highly dependent on the course of the virus and the public sectors response to it several risks to the outlook were noted including the possibility that additional waves of virus outbreaks could result in ex tended economic disruptions and a protracted period of reduced economic activity in such scenarios banks and other lenders could tighten conditions in credit markets appreciably and restrain the availability of credit to households and businesses other risks cited included the possibility that fiscal support for households busi nesses and state and local governments might not pro vide sufficient relief of financial strains in these sectors and that some foreign economies could come under greater pressure than anticipated as a result of the spread of the pandemic abroad several participants noted po tential longerrun effects of the pandemic associated with possible restructuring in some sectors of the econ omy that could slow the growth of the economys pro ductive capacity for some time a number of participants commented on various poten tial risks to financial stability banks and other financial institutions could come under significant stress particu larly if one of the more adverse scenarios regarding the spread of the virus and its effects on economic activity was realized nonfinancial corporations had carried high levels of indebtedness into the pandemic increas ing their risk of insolvency there were also concerns that the anticipated increase in treasury debt over the next few years could have implications for market func tioning there was general agreement that these institu tions activities and markets should be monitored closely and a few participants noted that improved data would be helpful for doing so several participants ob served that the federal reserve had recently taken steps to help ensure that banks remain resilient through the pandemic including by conducting additional sensitivity analysis in conjunction with the most recent bank stress tests and imposing temporary restrictions on share holder payouts to preserve banks capital a couple of participants noted that they believed that restrictions on shareholder payouts should be extended while another judged that such a step would be premature in their consideration of monetary policy at this meeting participants reaffirmed their commitment to using the federal reserves full range of tools to support the us economy during this challenging time thereby promot ing its maximum employment and price stability goals they noted that the path of the economy would depend significantly on the course of the virus and that the on going public health crisis would weigh heavily on eco nomic activity employment and inflation in the near term and posed considerable risks to the economic out look over the medium term in light of this assessment all participants considered it appropriate to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at to percent furthermore participants continued to judge that it would be appropriate to maintain this target range until they were confident that the economy had weathered re cent events and was on track to achieve the committees maximum employment and price stability goals participants also judged that in order to continue to sup port the flow of credit to households and businesses it would be appropriate over coming months for the fed eral reserve to increase its holdings of treasury securi ties and agency residential mortgagebacked securities rmbs and cmbs at least at the current pace these actions would be helpful in sustaining smooth market functioning thereby fostering the effective transmission of monetary policy to broader financial conditions in addition participants noted that it was appropriate that the desk would continue to offer largescale overnight and term repo operations participants observed that it would be important to continue to monitor develop ments closely and that the committee would be pre pared to adjust its plans as appropriate participants discussed the current stance of monetary policy and the circumstances under which they might in crease monetary policy accommodation or clarify their intentions regarding policy participants generally judged that the committees policy actions over the past several months had provided substantial accommoda tion several of them observed that the committees as set purchases which were designed to support financial market functioning and the smooth flow of credit were likely also providing a degree of policy accommodation noting the increase in uncertainty about the economic outlook over the intermeeting period several partici pants suggested that additional accommodation could be required to promote economic recovery and return in flation to the committees percent objective some participants observed that due to the nature of the shock that the us economy was experiencing strong page federal open market committee fiscal policy support would be necessary to encourage expeditious improvements in labor market conditions with regard to the outlook for monetary policy beyond this meeting a number of participants noted that provid ing greater clarity regarding the likely path of the target range for the federal funds rate would be appropriate at some point concerning the possible form that revised policy communications might take these participants commented on outcomebased forward guidanceun der which the committee would undertake to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate at least until one or more specified economic outcomes was achievedand also touched on calendarbased forward guidanceunder which the current target range would be maintained at least until a particular calendar date in the context of outcomebased forward guidance various participants mentioned using thresholds calibrated to in flation outcomes unemployment rate outcomes or combinations of the two as well as combinations with calendarbased guidance in addition many participants commented that it might become appropriate to frame communications regarding the committees ongoing as set purchases more in terms of their role in fostering ac commodative financial conditions and supporting eco nomic recovery more broadly in discussing the policy outlook a number of participants observed that com pleting a revised statement on longerrun goals and monetary policy strategy would be very helpful in providing an overarching framework that would help guide the committees future policy actions and com munications a majority of participants commented on yield caps and targetsapproaches that cap or target interest rates along the yield curveas a monetary policy tool of those participants who discussed this option most judged that yield caps and targets would likely provide only modest benefits in the current environment as the committees forward guidance regarding the path of the federal funds rate already appeared highly credible and longerterm interest rates were already low many of these participants also pointed to potential costs associ ated with yield caps and targets among these costs par ticipants noted the possibility of an excessively rapid ex pansion of the balance sheet and difficulties in the design and communication of the conditions under which such a policy would be terminated especially in conjunction with forward guidance regarding the policy rate in light of these concerns many participants judged that yield caps and targets were not warranted in the current envi ronment but should remain an option that the commit tee could reassess in the future if circumstances changed markedly a couple of participants remarked on the value of yield caps and targets as a means of reinforcing forward guidance on asset purchases thereby providing insurance against adverse movements in market expec tations regarding the path of monetary policy and as a tool that could help limit the amount of asset purchases that the committee would need to make in pursuing its dualmandate goals committee policy action in their discussion of monetary policy for this

federal reserve bank of new york jenny tang senior economic policy advisor federal reserve bank of boston opening remarks the chair vice chair williams and governor clarida opened the meeting with remarks in memory of thomas laubach attended tuesdays session only chair powell thomas was unquestionably one of the great economic minds of his generation and his re search has been central to some of our biggest discussions and policy actions over the past sev eral years he had a rare and underappreciated gift for translating arcane and academic theory into real world practice that ability made a real difference in the conduct and communication of monetary policy from his work on r to the balance sheet to leading the steering committee for our monetary policy review thomas lau bachs intellectual fingerprints are all over the committees decisions that will define this era of the federal reserve thomas was also an exceptional colleague leader and friend no one here will be sur prised to know that as condolences pour in the admiration for his kindness and equanimity match if not exceed the esteem for his intellect thomas was a model of leadership who fiercely believed that every member of his team is criti cal to our collective success and he made cer tain they knew it even as he battled his own health problems working through treatment to help fight the economic fallout of a global pan demic his concern lay with others amid a del uge of emergency work to fight a historic down turn and the upending of daily life thomas urged people to take care of themselves and their families first it is a testament to the mu tual respect and amity that it was thomass team who proposed the tealbook dedication in his memory as friends colleagues and collaborators we all grieve his loss his absence leaves a space that cannot truly be filled we will miss thomas laubachs intellect and his insight more im portantly we will miss thomas laubach vice chair williams thomas and i started working together years ago he had just arrived at the board from the kansas city fed and i had returned from my stint at the council of economic ad visers and it was truly serendipitous we im mediately recognized the shared interest in fig uring out how to estimate this thing called the page federal open market committee natural rate of interest and more importantly thomas was an expert in kalman filtering so we were off to the races on that project ironi cally given subsequent events the question of the time was whether the productivity boom had driven r higher in fact if you go back to our december memo our first memo to the board on r our original estimates had r at percent and thats real not nominal so thats a percent nominal r those were the days jumping ahead years following his appoint ment as director of monetary affairs thomas would frequently and very earnestly ask me how he could be most effective in his role as an adviser to the fomc and id remind him that the committee has at times been compared to a herd of cats but he was always looking for ways to raise his game and hopefully ours and help the committee grapple with issues and de cisions before us sometimes that effort led to briefings with a labyrinth of charts and figures where thomas heroically tried to make sense of our summary of economic projections sep projections and the implicit policy rule that must be embedded in them if you only looked hard enough or it goes without saying how everything makes more sense once you factor in r his role as trusted adviser was never more on display or important than during the framework review as chair powell just commented thomas focused on making sure the commit tee was prepared with the very best information and analysis he consistently moved us towards the goal line even as he engaged in a complex range of issues and dealt with the effects of the pandemic and he scrupulously played the role of honest broker throughout indeed he per fected the formula for herding cats its one part keen intellect a dollop of understated hu mor and a big helping of patience and persever ance governor clarida thomas laubach was a remarkable human be ing who just happened to be a world class econ omist his passing last week represents of course an incalculable loss for his family but is also a devastating blow felt by each and every one of us in the federal reserve system and indeed in major central banks around the world that he frequently visited before i arrived at the board i knew thomas primarily through his research his book on in flation targeting with ben bernanke rick mish kin and adam posen is a classic reference on the subject as is his work with president wil liams on r i would say thomas had a talent for picking coauthors thomas and i first met when he was a phd student working on the book and we were both visiting the new york fed i remember well our first meeting years ago and i was struck then by thomass enthusiasm that he brought to economics as a graduate stu dent thomas of course never lost that spark and joy for the practice of monetary policy and we are all fortunate that he did not iand im sure chair powell and before him chair yellentrusted him implicitly and speaking for myself i always sought his insight and ad vice privately in my office and counsel on all of the big policy decisions ive had to consider in my two years as vice chair thomas made everyone that he worked with better and inspired to put forth their best energy and effort to achieve larger goals that was most certainly the case in the framework review and ill second what vice chair williams and chair powell said thomas brought peerless leadership energy and a commitment to the en tire framework review we simply would not have achieved the evolution of our framework and strategy without thomas and the insight inspiration and good judgment he brought to the project and the ambitious process that he designed and worked with us to implement i understand that in thomass last days he was able to watch the chairs speech at jackson hole rolling out the new framework and that he was so proud to have been part of what the wall street journal called a landmark change in us monetary policy im sure i speak for all of us when i conclude by saying that it is we who are proud to have had the privilege of working with thomas laubach during his years at the fed he is and will be deeply missed but his spirit and inspiration to us all will endure minutes of the meeting of september page developments in financial markets and open market operations the system open market account soma manager first discussed developments in financial markets on net financial conditions eased over the intermeeting pe riod equity prices rose and the broad dollar continued to depreciate from its crisisdriven peak in march yields on treasury inflationprotected securities fell while longerdated nominal treasury yields increased modestly market participants attributed these developments to a stronger economic outlook better news on the covid trajectory betterthanfeared corporate earnings re ports and accommodative policy against this back drop most respondents to the open market desks sur vey of primary dealers and survey of market partici pants perceived downside risks to us gross domestic product gdp growth this year as having declined no tably since the july survey and their forecasts for overall growth for were revised up significantly while the economic outlook had brightened market participants continued to see significant risks ahead some noted concerns about elevated asset valuations in certain sectors many also cited geopolitical events as heightening uncertainty in addition most forecasters were assuming that an additional pandemicrelated fiscal package would be approved this year and noted that absent a new package growth could decelerate at a fasterthanexpected pace in the fourth quarter in light of these and other risks as well as the ongoing pan demic market participants continued to suggest that the supportive policy environment and the backstops to market functioning remained important stabilizers the release of the revised statement on longerrun goals and monetary policy strategy consensus state ment elicited relatively modest immediate reaction across markets however market participants generally viewed the completion of the review as an important milestone many indicated that growing expectations for the committee to adopt a flexible averageinflation targeting regime had influenced asset prices over recent months in particular these expectations were viewed as contributing to the recent rise in farforward measures of inflation compensation though market participants noted that these measures were still somewhat low by historical standards market participants continued to anticipate that the committee would update its forward guidance for the federal funds rate most respondents to the desks sur veys continued to indicate that they expected the fomc to adopt outcomebased forward guidance linked to in flation some noted that employment measures could be part of the forward guidance as well survey respond ents expectations for the economic conditions that would prevail when the fomc first lifted the target range had shifted notably since the previous survey with many respondents projecting somewhat higher inflation and lower unemployment than in july expectations for asset purchases this year remained tightly centered around the current pace however many survey re spondents revised up the amount of asset purchases ex pected in and the manager turned next to a discussion of funding mar ket conditions and open market operations over the pe riod conditions in shortterm dollar funding markets remained stable over the period overnight secured and unsecured rates continued to trade in narrow ranges near the interest on excess reserves rate forward measures of funding rates implied that conditions were expected to remain stable in coming months markets for treasury securities and agency mortgage backed securities mbs continued to function smoothly with bidask spreads and a range of other in dicators remaining near prepandemic levels indicators of functioning in the market for agency commercial mortgagebacked securities cmbs also remained sta ble in light of the improved conditions the staff pro posed that the desk no longer be required to increase agency cmbs holdings or reinvest principal payments for agency cmbs for the time being the desk would continue to conduct regular agency cmbs operations to maintain backstop capacity by unanimous vote the committee ratified the desks domestic transactions over the intermeeting period there were no intervention operations in foreign curren cies for the systems account during the intermeeting pe riod staff review of the economic situation the covid pandemic and the measures undertaken to contain its spread continued to affect economic activ ity in the united states and abroad the information available at the time of the september meeting suggested that us real gdp was rebounding at a rapid rate in the third quarter labor market conditions con tinued to improve markedly in july and august but em ployment was still below its level at the beginning of the year consumer price inflationas measured by the month percentage change in the price index for per sonal consumption expenditures pce through july page federal open market committee remained well below the rates that prevailed early in the year total nonfarm payroll employment expanded strongly in july and august although payrolls had retraced only about half of the jobs lost at the onset of the pandemic the unemployment rate moved down further to per cent in august the unemployment rates for african americans asians and hispanics declined over the past two months but remained well above the national aver age the labor force participation rate rose on net and the employmenttopopulation ratio increased further in july and august initial claims for unemployment insur ance benefits continued to move down on net through early september but the pace of declines had slowed in addition weekly estimates of privatesector payrolls con structed by the boards staff using data provided by the payroll processor adp suggested that employment gains likely were still solid from midaugust to early septem ber total pce price inflation was percent over the months ending in july reflecting both weak aggregate demand and a considerable drop in consumer energy prices early this year core pce price inflation which excludes changes in consumer food and energy prices was percent over the same month period by comparison the trimmed mean measure of month pce price inflation constructed by the federal reserve bank of dallas was percent in july the consumer price index cpi increased percent over the months ending in august while core cpi inflation was percent over the same period on a monthly basis recent inflation readings were bolstered by in creases in durable goods prices largely reflecting the strong demand for consumer goods as household pur chases shifted away from many consumer services the latest readings on surveybased measures of longerrun inflation expectations moved up a bit but remained within their ranges in recent years the university of michigan surveys of consumers measure for the next to years edged up in july and august and the three yearahead measure from the federal reserve bank of new yorks survey of consumer expectations also crept up over the past two months real pce expanded strongly in july and continued to be bolstered by supportive fiscal and monetary policy ac tions in august the components of retail sales used to estimate pce along with sales of light motor vehicles increased further however recent highfrequency indi cators of spending on some consumer servicessuch as restaurant dining hotel accommodations and air travelwere still subdued real disposable personal in come was roughly flat in july primarily reflecting further gains in wage and salary income that were largely offset by the waning of government transfer payments from their peak in the spring nevertheless the personal sav ing rate remained quite elevated the consumer senti ment measure from the michigan survey edged up in august while the conference board survey measure moved down both measures continued to be below their levels at the beginning of the year housingsector activity continued to expand likely sup ported by the effects of low interest rates starts and building permit issuance for singlefamily homes along with starts of multifamily units increased further in july sales of both new and existing homes also rose substan tially further these measures of construction and sales were generally at or near their prepandemic levels indicators of business fixed investment suggested that this sector was beginning to recover on balance nomi nal new orders and shipments of nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft increased in july the third con secutive monthly increase in these indicators of business equipment spending many measures of business senti ment also improved somewhat in july and august in addition the number of crude oil and natural gas rigs in operation through early septemberan indicator of business spending on structures in the drilling and min ing

as a result of the covid pandemic and the associ ated restrictive measures to contain it with some of these measures having been rolled back in recent months economic indicators pointed to a large but par tial rebound in most foreign economies in the third quarter recent indicators of household and business spending were strong in several economies including canada the euro area and brazil reflecting in part a boost from substantial government support programs in china economic indicators showed a continued moderate expansion after a sharp rebound in the second quarter though gains in

of com munications about monetary policy over the intermeet ing period generally had little effect on treasury yields or the expected path of the federal funds rate however market participants

fund liquidity facility or the commercial paper funding facility the effective federal funds rate and the secured over night financing rate averaged basis points over the intermeeting period the amount of federal reserve repo outstanding remained at zero over the intermeeting period due to more attractive rates in the private market meanwhile the federal reserve increased holdings of treasury

amid notable equity market gains in august gross equity issuance was robust as seasoned offerings strengthened to about double their typical pace commercial and industrial loans outstanding de clined in july and august but at a slower pace than in june with declines in large part reflecting continued creditline repayment the credit quality of nonfinancial corporations showed tentative signs of

likely partly driven by the recovery of cmbs markets delinquency rates on mortgages backing cmbs fell a bit in july but remained high in the hotel and retail sectors minutes of the meeting of september page financing conditions in the residential mortgage market were little changed over the intermeeting period while mortgage rates hovered near historical lows the spread between primary mortgage rates and mbs yields re mained quite wide credit continued to flow to higher score borrowers who met standard conforming loan cri teria while it remained tight for borrowers with lower credit scores and for nonstandard mortgage products nonetheless low mortgage rates were supporting both homepurchase originations and refinancing the credit quality of mortgages improved slightly with the rate of transition into delinquency remaining near pre pandemic levels and forbearance continuing to slowly decline financing conditions in consumer credit markets re mained accommodative for borrowers with relatively strong credit scores but continued to be tight for sub prime borrowers auto loan balances increased solidly overall but declined for borrowers with low credit scores credit card balances contracted at a slower rate in june and july than in the spring however offered interest rates rose and credit limits edged down for credit cards to nonprime borrowers conditions in the asset backed securities abs market were stable during the intermeeting period abs spreads edged down and auto and student loan issuance was robust consumer credit performance remained stable and the share of auto and credit card balances in forbearance declined staff economic outlook in the us economic projection prepared by the staff for the september fomc meeting the rate of real gdp growth and the pace of declines in the unemployment rate were faster over the second half of this year than in the july forecast primarily reflecting recent betterthan expected data in addition the inflation forecast for the rest of the year was revised up slightly as some recent consumer goods prices were stronger than expected nevertheless inflation was still projected to be subdued this year reflecting substantial slack in resource utiliza tion and the sizable declines in consumer energy prices earlier this year fiscal policy measures along with the support from monetary policy and the federal reserves liquidity and lending facilities were expected to continue supporting the secondhalf recovery although the re covery was forecast to be far from complete by yearend the staffs forecast assumed the enactment of some ad ditional fiscal policy support this year without that addi tional policy action the pace of the economic recovery would likely be slower in the staffs mediumterm projection the baseline as sumptions included that the current restrictions on so cial interactions and business operations along with vol untary social distancing by individuals and firms would ease gradually through next year in addition the staff projection assumed that monetary policy would be even more accommodative than in the previous forecast in order to more fully reflect the revised consensus state ment altogether the rate of real gdp growth was pro jected to exceed potential output growth the unemploy ment rate was expected to decline considerably further and inflation was forecast to pick back up in through with the moreaccommodative monetary policy assumed in the current forecast which reflected the recent consensus statement inflation was projected to moderately overshoot percent for some time in the years beyond the staff continued to observe that the uncertainty re lated to the course of the covid pandemic and its associated economic effects was extremely elevated and that the risks to the outlook were still tilted to the down side given the apparent resilience of the us economy to the acceleration in the spread of the pandemic during the summer the staff judged that a significantly more pessimistic economic outcome which the staff had pre viously viewed as no less plausible than the baseline fore cast and had featured a renewed downturn in economic activity was now less likely than the baseline forecast participants views on current conditions and the economic outlook in conjunction with this fomc meeting participants submitted their projections of the most likely outcomes for real gdp growth the unemployment rate and infla tion for each year from through and over the longer run based on their individual assessments of ap propriate monetary policyincluding the path for the federal funds rate the longerrun projections repre sented each participants assessment of the rate to which each variable would be expected to converge over time under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy these projections are described in the sep which is an addendum to these minutes participants noted that the covid pandemic was causing tremendous human and economic hardship across the united states and around the world eco nomic activity and employment had picked up in recent months but remained well below their levels at the be ginning of the year weaker demand and significantly page federal open market committee lower oil prices were holding down consumer price in flation overall financial conditions had improved in re cent months in part reflecting policy measures to sup port the economy and the flow of credit to us house holds and businesses participants agreed that the path of the economy would depend on the course of the virus and that the ongoing public health crisis would continue to weigh on economic activity employment and infla tion in the near term and posed considerable risks to the economys mediumterm outlook participants observed that the incoming data indicated that economic activity was recovering faster than ex pected from its depressed secondquarter level when much of the economy was shut down to stem the spread of the virus in particular with the reopening of many businesses and fewer people withdrawing from social in teractions consumer spending was rebounding sharply and appeared to have recovered about threefourths of its earlier decline prior fiscal policy actions were seen as having supported the ability and willingness of house holds to spend although most participants expressed concern about the expiration of the enhanced unem ployment insurance benefits from the cares act coronavirus aid relief and economic security act and judged that additional fiscal relief would help sustain the recovery in household spending indeed many par ticipants noted that their economic outlook assumed ad ditional fiscal support and that if future fiscal support was significantly smaller or arrived significantly later than they expected the pace of the recovery could be slower than anticipated participants also viewed accom modative monetary policy as contributing to gains in res idential investment as well as consumer purchases of motor vehicles and other durable goods while partici pants pointed to strength in consumers purchases of goods especially those sold online they noted that out lays for services had been slower to recover particularly for items such as air travel hotel accommodations and restaurant meals which had been significantly disrupted by socialdistancing measures participants generally ex pected spending on these services to remain subdued for some time and thus to be a restraining factor on the pace of the recovery a few participants raised the possibility that the unwinding of the large pool of household sav ings accumulated during the pandemic could provide greaterthananticipated momentum to consumption going forward however a couple of other participants judged that if this savings reflected reduced spending on inperson services by highincome consumers it was un likely to provide much momentum to future consump tion participants noted that business investment which had plummeted in the second quarter appeared to have be gun to turn around they pointed to data showing gains in capital goods orders and shipments as well as im proved business sentiment a number of participants judged that low interest rates were supporting business investment however the recovery was viewed as une venly distributed across industries while many business contacts reported progress on adapting to the pandemic others noted that industries that relied more on person toperson interactions continued to struggle business contacts with ties to the motor vehicle or housing indus tries indicated increased activity while those closer to the aviation hospitality and nonresidential construction industries were not seeing much of a recovery contacts continued to report ongoing stresses in the energy sec tor as well as challenges in the agricultural sector even though some crop prices had risen recently as sales to china increased although business contacts indicated that overall busi ness activity had been stronger than they expected it re mained well below prepandemic levels business con tacts pointed to several factors that could restrain further recovery including high levels of uncertainty that were reportedly still holding back hiring and capital spending some contacts reported difficulties in managing disrup tions in supply chains as well as elevated levels of em ployee absenteeism because of the pandemic addition ally district contacts indicated that fiscal policy had helped support small businesses while federal aid pay ments had helped support farm incomes participants observed that labor market conditions con tinued to improve in recent months and that the econ omy through august had regained roughly half of the million jobs that were lost in march and april the gains in employment over july and august were gener ally seen as larger than anticipated participants judged however that the labor market was a long way from be ing fully recovered they generally agreed that prospects for a further substantial improvement in the labor mar ket would depend on a broad and sustained reopening of businesses which in turn would depend importantly on how safe individuals felt to reengage in a wide range of activities some participants noted that the majority of gains in employment so far reflected workers on tem porary layoffs returning to work these participants judged it as less likely for future job gains to continue at their recent pace because a greater share of the remain ing layoffs might become permanent workers facing permanent layoffs were seen as more likely to need to find new jobs in different industries and this process minutes of the meeting of september page could take time especially to the extent that these work ers needed to be retrained participants observed that lowerpaid workers had been disproportionally affected by the economic effects of the pandemic many of these workers were employed in the service sector or other industries most adversely affected by socialdistancing measures with a disproportionate share of servicesector jobs held by african americans hispanics and women these groups were seen as being especially hard hit by the economic hardships caused by the pandemic participants viewed fiscal support from the cares act as having been very important in bol stering the financial situations of millions of families and a number of participants judged that the absence of fur ther fiscal support would exacerbate economic hard ships in minority and lowerincome communities in ad dition several participants observed that the effects of the pandemic were disrupting the supply of labor be cause of the need to care for children many of whom were attending school virtually from home in their comments about inflation participants noted that consumer prices had increased more quickly than expected in recent months and that marketbased measures of inflation compensation had increased mod erately over the intermeeting period although they re mained low the upturn in consumer prices was primar ily attributed to price increases in sectors such as con sumer durables in which demand had risen after experi encing a large decline earlier this spring nevertheless inflation remained subdued and participants still gener ally judged that the overall effect of the pandemic on prices was disinflationary while the outlook for infla tion was viewed as highly uncertain a number of partic ipants projected that inflation would run below the committees percent longerrun objective for a signif icant period before moving moderately above percent for some timeconsistent with the committees revised consensus statement participants noted that financial conditions were gener ally accommodative and that actions by the federal re serve including the establishment of emergency lending facilities in conjunction with the treasury were support ing the flow of credit to households businesses and communities while these actions as well as prompt and forceful monetary policy measures in response to the pandemic were viewed as contributing to accommoda tive financial conditions participants noted important differences in credit quality and credit availability across borrowers while the pace of corporate downgrades was seen as having decreased significantly in recent months the delinquency rates on business loans had risen notice ably bank contacts reported ample capacity to lend to creditworthy borrowers however surveys of credit availability indicated that bank lending was tight fur thermore several participants noted the stress that small and mediumsized banks could face from defaults on loans to small businesses and cre properties if peo ple continued to withdraw from travel and shopping ac tivities additionally a couple of participants indicated that highly accommodative financial market conditions could lead to excessive risktaking and to a buildup of financial imbalances participants continued to see the uncertainty surround ing the economic outlook as very elevated with the path of the economy highly dependent on the course of the virus on how individuals businesses and public officials responded to it and on the effectiveness of public health measures to address it participants cited several down side risks that could threaten the recovery while the risk of another broad economic shutdown was seen as having receded participants remained concerned about the possibility of additional virus outbreaks that could undermine the recovery such scenarios could result in increases in bankruptcies and defaults put stress on the financial system and lead to disruptions in the flow of credit to households and businesses most participants raised the concern that fiscal support so far for house holds businesses and state and local governments might not provide sufficient relief to these sectors a couple of participants saw an upside risk that further fiscal stim ulus could be larger than anticipated though it might come later than had been expected several participants raised concerns regarding the longerrun effects of the pandemic including how it could lead to a restructuring in some sectors of the economy that could slow employ ment growth or could accelerate technological disrup tion that was likely limiting the pricing power of firms in their consideration of monetary policy at this meeting participants reaffirmed that they were committed to us ing the federal reserves full range of tools in order to support the us economy during this challenging time thereby promoting the committees statutory goals of maximum employment and price stability they also noted that the path of the economy would depend sig nificantly on the course of the virus and that the ongoing public health crisis would continue to weigh on eco nomic activity employment and inflation in the near term and posed considerable risks to the economic out look over the medium term page federal open market committee all participants agreed that the completion of the frame work review and the publication of the revised consen sus statement provided a strong foundation for mone tary policy decisions and communications going for ward accordingly participants agreed that it would be appropriate to incorporate some key elements of the re vised consensus statement into the fomc statement to be released following this meeting in particular partic ipants reiterated their commitment to achieve maximum employment and an inflation rate of percent over the longer run with inflation running persistently below its longerrun goal participants judged that it would be ap propriate to aim to achieve inflation moderately above percent for some time so that inflation would average percent over time and longerterm inflation expecta tions would remain well anchored at percent against this backdrop participants discussed a range of issues associated with providing greater clarity about the likely path of the federal funds rate in the years ahead most participants supported providing more explicit outcomebased forward guidance for the federal funds rate that included establishing criteria for lifting the fed eral funds rate above the elb in terms of the paths for employment or inflation or both among the partici pants who favored providing more explicit forward guidance at this meeting all but a couple supported a formulation in which the forward guidance included lan guage indicating that it would likely be appropriate to maintain the current target range until labor market con ditions were judged to be consistent with the commit tees assessments of maximum employment and infla tion had risen to percent and was on track to moder ately exceed percent for some time these participants noted that communicating that the target range for the federal funds rate would remain at the elb until these criteria were achieved would provide appropriately clear and strong policy guidance doing so at this meeting was viewed as an especially important way of affirming the committees commitment to achieving the eco nomic outcomes articulated in the consensus statement participants generally noted that outcomebased for ward guidance for the federal funds rate of this type was not an unconditional commitment to a particular path indeed outcomebased guidance of this type would al low the public to infer changes in the committees as sessment of how long the target range for the federal funds rate would remain at its current setting infor mation pointing to a weaker outlook for the economy and inflation would tend to lead to public expectations for a longer period at the current setting of the target range while information suggesting a stronger outlook for the economy and inflation would tend to lead to ex pectations for a shorter period at the current setting in addition circumstances could arise in which the com mittee judged that it would be appropriate to change its guidance particularly if risks emerged that could impede the attainment of its economic objectives a couple of participants preferred even stronger and less qualified outcomebased forward guidance that they judged would more clearly convey the committees commitment to its objectives and to the strategic ap proach that was articulated in the revised consensus statement in particular these participants preferred for ward guidance in which the target range for the federal funds rate remained at the elb until inflation had moved above percent for some time especially in light of the lengthy period in which inflation has run be low the committees longerrun percent objective these participants judged that it was critical to demon strate the committees commitment to achieve out comes in which inflation averages percent over time several participants noted that while they agreed it was appropriate to incorporate key elements of the consen sus statement into the postmeeting statement they pre ferred to retain forward guidance similar to that pro vided in recent fomc statements these participants judged that it would likely be appropriate to maintain an accommodative stance of policy for some time in order to foster outcomes consistent with the committees re vised consensus statement however with longerterm interest rates already very low there did not appear to be a need for enhanced forward guidance at this juncture or much scope for forward guidance to put additional downward pressure on yields moreover these partici pants were concerned that forward guidance that in volved the target range for the federal funds rate remain ing at the elb until employment and inflation criteria were achieved could limit the committees flexibility for years furthermore by influencing expectations for the path of shortterm interest rates such guidance could contribute to a buildup of financial imbalances that would make it more difficult for the committee to achieve its objectives in the future regarding asset purchases participants judged that it would be appropriate over coming months for the fed eral reserve to increase its holdings of treasury securi ties and agency mbs at least at the current pace these actions would continue to help sustain smooth market functioning and would continue to help foster accom modative financial conditions thereby supporting the minutes of the meeting of september page flow of credit to households and businesses some par ticipants also noted that in future meetings it would be appropriate to further assess and communicate how the committees asset purchase program could best support the achievement of the committees maximum employment and pricestability goals participants widely echoed the remarks at the opening of the meeting in memory of thomas laubach partici pants universally recognized his great leadership and in tellectual contributions to the work of the committee as well as his warm and generous spirit committee policy action in their discussion of monetary policy for this meeting members agreed that the covid pandemic was causing tremendous human and economic hardship across the united states and around the world they noted that economic activity and employment had picked up in recent months but remained well below their levels at the beginning of the year and that weaker demand and significantly lower oil prices were holding down consumer price inflation overall financial con ditions had improved in recent months in part reflecting policy measures to support the economy and the flow of credit to us households and businesses members agreed that the federal reserve was committed to using its full range of tools to support the us economy in this challenging time thereby promoting its maximumem ployment and pricestability goals members also stated that the path of the economy would depend significantly on the course of the virus in addition members agreed that the ongoing public health crisis would continue to weigh on economic activity employment and inflation in the near term and was posing considerable risks to the economic outlook over the medium term all members agreed to incorporate into the postmeeting statement key elements of the committees revised statement on longerrun goals and monetary policy strategy members judged that this action would under score the committees strong commitment to the goals and strategy articulated in the new consensus statement in pursuit of the committees statutory objectives ac cordingly members agreed that the fomc statement should note that the committee seeks to achieve maxi mum employment and inflation at the rate of percent over the longer run and that with inflation running per sistently below this longerrun goal the committee will aim to achieve inflation moderately above percent for some time so that inflation averages percent over time and longerterm inflation expectations remain well an chored at percent members generally expected that it would be appropriate to maintain an accommodative stance of monetary policy until these outcomes were achieved all members agreed to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at to percent almost all members viewed this meeting as the appropriate time to modify forward guidance to provide greater clarity regarding the likely future path of the federal funds rate to this end almost all members agreed on a specification for out comebased forward guidance that indicated that the committee expects that it will be appropriate to main tain the current setting of the target range for the federal funds rate until labor market conditions had reached lev els consistent with the committees assessments of max imum employment and inflation had risen to percent and was on track to run moderately in excess of per cent for some time two members dissented from the policy decision one of these dissenting members pre ferred that the committee retain greater policy rate flex ibility by retaining the language in the forward guidance provided in the july postmeeting statement that lan guage noted that it would be appropriate to maintain the current target range until the committee was confident that the economy had weathered recent events and was on track to achieve its maximum employment and price stability goals the other dissenting member preferred a stronger formulation for the forward guidanceone in which the committee would indicate that it expected to maintain the current target range until core inflation had reached percent on a sustained basis in their discussion of monetary policy for the period ahead members generally agreed that the committees policy guidance expressed its assessment about the path for the federal funds rate most likely to be consistent with achievement of the committees goals but that it was not an unconditional commitment they stated that the appropriate rate path would depend on the evolution of the economic outlook accordingly they agreed that the committee would be prepared to adjust the stance of policy as appropriate in the event that risks emerged that could impede the attainment of the committees goals members also agreed that in assessing the appro priate stance of monetary policy they would take into account a wide range of information including readings on public health labor market conditions inflation pres sures and inflation expectations and financial and inter national developments members noted that the committees asset purchases had helped foster significant improvements in market functioning over recent months in addition purchases page federal open market committee of securities were contributing to accommodative finan cial conditions in a way that supported economic recov ery consistent with these observations members agreed that it would be appropriate to acknowledge in the postmeeting statement the role of asset purchases in supporting accommodative financial conditions the committees statement thus indicated that over coming months it would be appropriate for the federal reserve to increase its holdings of treasury securities and agency mbs at least at the current pace to sustain smooth mar ket functioning and to help foster accommodative finan cial conditions thereby supporting the flow of credit to households and businesses members considered the staff proposal to eliminate the requirement in the directive to increase the holdings of agency cmbs in the soma portfolio in light of the substantial improvement in market functioning in the agency cmbs market the committee judged that it would be appropriate for the desk to purchase agency cmbs only as needed to sustain smooth market func tioning rather than seek to steadily increase agency cmbs holdings and to cease reinvestments of agency cmbs principal payments members also concluded that in light of ongoing low takeup at desk repo oper ations it was not necessary to include a sentence on these operations in the fomc statement however the directive adopted by the committee continued to direct the desk to conduct overnight and term repo operations to support effective policy implementation and smooth functioning of shortterm us dollar funding markets at the conclusion of the discussion the committee voted to authorize and direct the federal reserve bank of new york until instructed otherwise to execute transactions in the soma in accordance with the fol lowing domestic policy directive for release at pm effective september the federal open market committee directs the desk to undertake open market operations as nec essary to maintain the federal funds rate in a target range of to percent increase the system open market ac count holdings of treasury securities and agency mortgagebacked securities mbs at the current pace increase holdings of treasury securities and agency mbs by ad ditional amounts and purchase agency commercial mortgagebacked securities cmbs as needed to sustain smooth func tioning of markets for these securities conduct term and overnight repurchase agreement operations to support effective policy implementation and the smooth functioning of shortterm us dollar funding markets conduct overnight reverse repurchase agreement operations at an offering rate of percent and with a percounterparty limit of billion per day the percoun terparty limit can be temporarily increased at the discretion of the chair roll over

agency mbs allow modest deviations from stated amounts for purchases and reinvestments if needed for operational reasons engage in dollar roll and coupon swap transactions as necessary to facilitate set tlement of the federal reserves agency mbs transactions the vote also encompassed approval of the statement below for release at pm the federal reserve is committed to using its full range of tools to support the us economy in this challenging time thereby promoting its maximum employment and price stability goals the covid pandemic is causing tremen dous human and economic hardship across

a number of other risks including the extent and timing of additional fiscal support the magnitude of supplyside disruptions associated with postponements of inclass school openings and small business closings the likelihood of elevated levels of business bankruptcies and credit quality problems that could potentially curtail lending several participants also expressed concerns about global geopolitical devel opments and related tensions as well as prolonged reces sionary dynamics such as labor market scarring or infla tion persistently undershooting the committees longer run goal participants assessments of the appropriate future path of the federal funds rate are also subject to considerable uncertainty because the committee adjusts monetary policy in response to actual and prospective develop ments over time in key economic variablessuch as real gdp growth the unemployment rate and inflation uncertainty surrounding the projected path for the fed eral funds rate importantly reflects the uncertainties about the paths for these economic variables along with other factors as with the macroeconomic variables the forecast uncertainty surrounding the appropriate path of the federal funds rate is substantial page federal open market committee forecast uncertainty the economic projections provided by the members of the board of governors and the presi dents of the federal reserve banks inform discus sions of monetary policy among policymakers and can aid public understanding of the basis for policy actions considerable uncertainty attends these projections however the economic and statistical models and relationships used to help produce eco nomic forecasts are necessarily imperfect descrip tions of the real world and the future path of the economy can be affected by myriad unforeseen de velopments and events thus in setting the stance of monetary policy participants consider not only what appears to be the most likely economic out come as embodied in their projections but also the range of alternative possibilities the likelihood of their occurring and the potential costs to the econ omy should they occur table summarizes the average historical accu racy of a range of forecasts including those re ported in past monetary policy reports and those pre pared by the federal reserve boards staff in ad vance of meetings of the federal open market committee the projection error ranges shown in the table illustrate the considerable uncertainty as sociated with economic forecasts for example suppose a participant projects that real gross do mestic product gdp and total consumer prices will rise steadily at annual rates of respectively percent and percent if the uncertainty attend ing those projections is similar to that experienced in the past and the risks around the projections are broadly balanced the numbers reported in table would imply a probability of about percent that actual gdp would expand within a range of to percent in the current year to percent in the second year to percent in the third year and to percent in the fourth year the cor responding percent confidence intervals for overall inflation would be to percent in the current year to percent in the second year to percent in the third year and to percent in the fourth year because current conditions may differ from those that prevailed on average over history participants provide judgments as to whether the uncertainty at tached to their projections of each economic variable is greater than smaller than or broadly similar to typ ical levels of forecast uncertainty seen in the past years as presented in table that is participants judge whether each eco nomic variable is more likely to be above or below their projections of the most likely outcome these judgments about the uncertainty and the risks attend ing each participants projections are distinct from the diversity of participants views about the most likely outcomes forecast uncertainty is concerned with the risks associated with a particular projection rather than with divergences across a number of different projections as with real activity and inflation the outlook for the future path of the federal funds rate is subject to considerable uncertainty this uncer tainty arises primarily because each participants as sessment of the appropriate stance of monetary policy depends importantly on the evolution of real activity and inflation over time if economic conditions evolve in an unexpected manner then assessments of the appropriate setting of the federal funds rate would change from that point forward the final line in ta ble shows the error ranges for forecasts of short term interest rates they suggest that the historical confidence intervals associated with projections of the federal funds rate are quite wide it should be noted however that these confidence intervals are not strictly consistent with the projections for the fed eral funds rate as these projections are not forecasts of the most likely quarterly outcomes but rather are projections of participants individual assessments of appropriate monetary policy and are on an endof year basis however the forecast errors should pro vide a sense of the uncertainty around the future path of the federal funds rate generated by the uncertainty about the macroeconomic variables as well as addi tional adjustments to monetary policy that would be appropriate to offset the effects of shocks to the economy summary of economic projections of the meeting of september page

conditions were little changed on net over the intermeeting period and remained accommodative market participants suggested that evolving expectations for us fiscal policy as well as strongerthanexpected economic data and corporate earnings reports helped support equity prices later in the intermeeting period however rising covid cases in europe and the united states weighed on the outlook and equity prices reversed some of their earlier gains implied volatility in the equity market moved higher during the intermeeting period reflecting uncertainties associated with the us election and the future path of fiscal policy as well as concerns about the trajectory of covid cases market participants expectations for the path of the fed eral funds rate were little changed over the intermeeting period in the open market desks survey of primary dealers and survey of market participants respondents views on when the committee will most likely start rais ing the target range for the federal funds rate were cen tered around expectations for the economic con ditions that will prevail when the fomc first lifts the target range were little changed since the september sur veys respondents to the desks surveys generally expected the federal reserves purchases of treasury securities and agency mortgagebacked securities mbs to con tinue at the current pace through the end of and then to slow in subsequent years although there was a wide range of views about purchase amounts for and market participants appeared increasingly fo cused on how the committees communications on as set purchases might evolve they expected those com munications to place a greater emphasis on fostering ac commodative financial conditions and many noted the possibility that at some point the committee might con vey additional guidance about the future path of asset purchases some market participants expected the com mittee to eventually lengthen the weighted average ma turity of the federal reserves purchases of treasury se curities page federal open market committee the manager turned next to a discussion of financial market functioning open market operations and condi tions in shortterm funding markets markets for treas ury securities and agency mbs continued to function smoothly with bidask spreads and a range of other mar ket functioning indicators remaining near prepandemic levels weekly operations continued for agency com mercial mortgagebacked securities cmbs with the desk purchasing only modest amounts shortterm dol lar funding markets also continued to function smoothly over the period and forward measures of funding rates were consistent with expectations for calm conditions over yearend the federal reserves balance sheet increased modestly over the intermeeting period to trillion as growth in securities holdings was partially offset by a decline in us dollar liquidity swaps outstanding outstanding balances for credit and liquidity facilities were little changed the manager noted that market participants continued to view these facilities as important backstops that would support market functioning and the flow of credit should stresses reemerge by unanimous vote the committee ratified the desks domestic transactions over the intermeeting period there were no intervention operations in foreign curren cies for the systems account during the intermeeting pe riod discussion on asset purchases participants discussed the fomcs asset purchases in cluding the role they are playing in supporting the com mittees maximumemployment and pricestability goals in their discussions participants focused on the objec tives of these purchases considerations for assessing the appropriate pace and composition of asset purchases over time communications regarding the future path of asset purchases and the potential effects of higher levels of reserves associated with the ongoing expansion in federal reserve asset holdings on banks balance sheets and money market rates participants agreed that this discussion would be helpful for future assessments of the appropriate structure of the committees asset pur chases while participants judged that immediate adjust ments to the pace and composition of asset purchases were not necessary they recognized that circumstances could shift to warrant such adjustments accordingly participants saw the ongoing careful consideration of potential next steps for enhancing the committees guid ance for its asset purchases as appropriate the participants discussion was preceded by staff presentations the staff reviewed some key considera tions relevant for conducting asset purchases in the cur rent environment the staff judged that the commit tees forward guidance on the federal funds rate the ex pansion of the federal reserves securities holdings since march and expectations for a further expansion all had contributed to a very low level of longerterm yields despite substantial treasury debt issuance the staff noted that financial market participants generally ex pected the committee to continue its net asset purchases at the current pace through next year and at a reduced pace in subsequent years the staff discussed various changes the committee could make to the structure of its purchases including to their pace and composition as well as to the guidance the committee has been provid ing to the public about its future asset purchases the staff discussed the structure of asset purchase programs of several foreign central banks and how they have evolved during the pandemic finally the staff evaluated how higher levels of reserves associated with the ongo ing expansion in the federal reserves asset holdings might influence banks balance sheets and money market rates and discussed the various tools that the federal re serve has for managing money market rates in an envi ronment with very high levels of reserves in their discussion regarding the role of the committees asset purchases participants noted that these purchases have supported and sustained smooth market function ing and helped foster accommodative financial condi tions with market functioning seen as having largely recovered many participants indicated that the role of asset purchases had shifted more toward fostering ac commodative financial conditions for households and businesses to support the committees employment and inflation goals still participants generally judged that asset purchases would continue to support smooth mar ket functioning and many judged that asset purchases helped provide insurance against risks that might reemerge in financial markets in an environment of high uncertainty a few participants indicated that asset pur chases could also help guard against undesirable upward pressure on longerterm rates that could arise for exam ple from higherthanexpected treasury debt issuance several participants noted the possibility that there may be limits to the amount of additional accommodation that could be provided through increases in the federal reserves asset holdings in light of the low level of longerterm yields and they expressed concerns that a significant expansion in asset holdings could have unin tended consequences minutes of the meeting of november page participants commented on considerations related to the appropriate pace and composition of asset purchases participants generally saw the current pace and compo sition as effective in fostering accommodative financial conditions participants noted that the committee could provide more accommodation if appropriate by in creasing the pace of purchases or by shifting its treasury purchases to those with a longer maturity without in creasing the size of its purchases alternatively the committee could provide more accommodation if ap propriate by conducting purchases of the same pace and composition over a longer horizon pointing to the re cently announced change in the bank of canadas asset purchase program several participants judged that the committee could maintain its current degree of accom modation by lengthening the maturity of the commit tees treasury purchases while reducing the pace of pur chases somewhat in their view such a change in the committees purchase structure would have to be care fully communicated to the public to avoid the misper ception that the reduced pace of purchases represented a decline in the degree of accommodation a few par ticipants expressed concern that maintaining the current pace of agency mbs purchases could contribute to po tential valuation pressures in housing markets the september fomc statement indicated that asset purchases will continue over coming months and par ticipants viewed this guidance for asset purchases as hav ing served the committee well so far most participants judged that the committee should update this guidance at some point and implement qualitative outcomebased guidance that links the horizon over which the commit tee anticipates it would be conducting asset purchases to economic conditions these participants indicated that updating the committees guidance for asset purchases in this manner would help keep the markets expectation for future asset purchases aligned with the committees intentions some of these participants also saw such up dated guidance as reinforcing the committees commit ment to fostering outcomes consistent with maximum employment and inflation that averages percent over time a few participants were hesitant to make changes in the near term to the guidance for asset purchases and pointed to considerable uncertainty about the economic outlook and the appropriate use of balance sheet policies given that uncertainty participants noted that it would be important for the committees guidance for future asset purchases to be consistent with the committees forward guidance for the federal funds rate so that the use of these tools would be well coordinated in terms of achieving the commit tees objectives most participants judged that the guid ance for asset purchases should imply that increases in the committees securities holdings would taper and cease sometime before the committee would begin to raise the target range for the federal funds rate a num ber of participants highlighted the view that after net purchases cease there would likely be a period of time in which maturing assets would be reinvested to roughly maintain the size of the federal reserves securities holdings participants commented on how a higher level of re serves associated with the expansion in the federal re serves asset holdings might affect the banking sector and money markets a few participants raised concerns about the possibility that much higher levels of reserves might create pressure on banks balance sheets includ ing on regulatory ratios or could potentially put undue downward pressure on money market rates most par ticipants judged that the federal reserve had effective tools to address these circumstances some participants noted that if needed the federal reserve could consider various steps to manage the levels of shortterm interest rates and the quantity of reserves such as adjusting ad ministered rates expanding the overnight reverse repur chase agreement program or implementing a maturity extension program staff review of the economic situation the coronavirus pandemic and the measures undertaken to contain its spread continued to affect economic activity in the united states and abroad the information available at the time of the november meeting suggested that us real gross domestic product gdp had rebounded at a rapid rate in the third quarter but remained well below its level at the start of the year labor market conditions improved further in september although the pace of gains eased and employment continued to be well below its level at the beginning of the year consumer price inflationas measured by the month percentage change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures pce through septemberhad returned to its year earlier pace but remained noticeably below the rates that were posted in january and february total nonfarm payroll employment expanded strongly in september but the gain was markedly below the even larger increases seen in previous months through sep tember payroll employment had retraced only about half of the decline seen at the onset of the pandemic page federal open market committee the unemployment rate moved down further to per cent in september the unemployment rates for african americans and asians both decreased but the unem ployment rate for hispanics was little changed and each groups rate remained well above the national average in addition the overall labor force participation rate de clined and the employmenttopopulation ratio rose only slightly initial claims for unemployment insurance continued to move lower on net through late october and weekly estimates of privatesector payrolls con structed by the boards staff using data provided by the payroll processor adp suggested that employment gains from midseptember to midoctober remained solid the employment cost index eci for total hourly labor compensation in the private sector which likely had been less influenced than other hourly compensation measures by the concentration of recent job losses among lowerwage workers rose percent over the months ending in september this gain was a little smaller than the indexs yearearlier month change in addition the month changes in the eci in june and september were noticeably below the average pace seen over the period from through total pce price inflation was percent over the months ending in september and continued to be held down by relatively weak aggregate demand and the declines in consumer energy prices seen earlier in the year core pce price inflation which excludes changes in consumer energy prices and many consumer food prices was percent over the same period while the trimmed mean measure of month pce price infla tion constructed by the federal reserve bank of dallas was percent in september on a monthly basis in flation was a little lower in september largely reflecting slower goods price inflation the latest readings on sur veybased measures of longerrun inflation expectations moved lower though each remained within the range in which it has fluctuated in recent years in october the university of michigan surveys of consumers measure for the next to years fell back to the level that pre vailed in early while in september the yearahead measure from the federal reserve bank of new york retraced its august increase real pce rose strongly in the third quarter though the increase was not sufficient to return consumer spending to its prepandemic level real disposable personal in come declined reflecting a large reduction in govern ment transfer payments as a result the personal saving rate moved sharply lower though it was still elevated rel ative to its average the consumer sentiment measures from the michigan survey and the conference board had moved higher on net since august although both indexes stood above their april troughs they re mained well below their levels at the start of the year housingsector activity advanced in the third quarter with real residential investment and home sales both moving above their firstquarter levels activity in this sector was likely being supported by low interest rates the sectors ability to adjust business practices in re sponse to social distancing and pentup demand follow ing the widespread shutdowns earlier in the year business fixed investment expanded strongly led by an outsized increase in thirdquarter equipment spending by contrast spending on nonresidential structures con tinued to move lower and was likely restrained by firms hesitation to commit to projects with lengthy times to completion and uncertain future returns as well as by the effect of lower oil prices on drilling investment growth in both total industrial production and manu facturing output turned negative in september after hav ing slowed markedly in august part of the softness in manufacturing production appeared to be attributable to pandemicrelated delays in the motor vehicle industrys modelyear changeover though subdued foreign de mand and weaker demand from domestic energy pro ducers were also likely acting to restrain factory output as of september manufacturing output had recovered roughly twothirds of the drop seen earlier in the year total real government purchases declined in the third quarter federal nondefense purchases fell especially sharply largely reflecting a stepdown in lender pro cessing fees associated with the paycheck protection program ppp in addition real purchases by state and local governments declined further the nominal us international trade deficit narrowed in september after widening in august both exports and imports continued to rebound from their collapse in the first half of the year goods imports fully recovered to their january level with broadbased increases in august and september in contrast goods exports by septem ber recovered only twothirds of their decline since jan uary despite brisk growth in exports of agricultural prod ucts and industrial supplies services trade remained de pressed driven by the continued suspension of most in ternational travel altogether net exports made a sub stantial negative contribution to real gdp growth in the third quarter economic activity abroad rebounded sharply in the third quarter following a rollback of pandemicrelated re strictions gdp levels however generally remained well minutes of the meeting of november page below their prepandemic peaks with china being a no table exception domestic demand supported the re covery and in asia there was also a strong rebound of exports especially of electronics and more recently au tos thirdquarter growth was particularly rapid in those economies that experienced some of the deepest con tractions in the second quarter including france italy and spain among the advanced foreign economies afes and mexico among the emerging market econo mies after falling through the end of the summer in many countries inflation rates started to rise over the past two months but remained well below rates from early in the year the rapid increase over recent weeks of new covid cases in several afes especially in europe prompted

declined for subprime borrowers auto loan interest rates in creased but stayed below prepandemic levels condi tions in the assetbacked securities market remained sta ble over the intermeeting period the staff provided an update on its assessment of the stability of the financial system the staff judged that accounting for low interest rates asset valuations ap peared moderate with measures of compensation for risk generally in the middle of their historical ranges however uncertainty regarding the pandemic and eco nomic outlook has been high and the risk of sizable de clines in asset prices should adverse shocks materialize has remained significant cre prices had started to de cline in some sectors while market conditions including rising vacancies and declining rents pointed to a risk of further drops especially in severely affected sectors the staff assessed vulnerabilities associated with house hold and business borrowing as notable household fi nances had weakened with the economic downturn and some households could find debt levels burdensome go ing forward business debt levels were high before the pandemic and the ability of some businesses to service these obligations will depend on the course of the eco nomic recovery the staff assessed vulnerabilities aris ing from financial leverage as moderate while the bank ing sector has been resilient to recent developments banks profitability as well as that of a range of financial institutions could be affected by future losses the weak ening of the economic outlook relative to prepandemic conditions and low interest rates with regard to fund ing risks the staff highlighted that structural vulnerabili ties in markets for shortterm funding and corporate bonds remained present emergency facilities were viewed as critical in restoring market functioning and continued to serve as important backstops the staff also summarized nearterm risks to financial stability identified in outreach to the public in recent months in cluding concerns associated with the outlook for the pandemic and business defaults staff economic outlook in the us economic projection prepared by the staff for the november fomc meeting the rate of real gdp growth and the pace of declines in the unemployment rate over the second half of this year were similar to those in the september forecast despite material revisions to several assumptions influencing the outlook along with incoming data that were on balance better than expected in particular in the absence of clear progress toward an agreement on further fiscal stimulus the staff removed the assumption that an additional tranche of fiscal policy support would be enacted although this lack of additional fiscal support was expected to cause significant hardships for a number of households the staff now assessed that the savings cushion accumulated by other households would be enough to allow total consumption to be largely maintained through yearend hence as in the september projection the staff continued to expect a rapid but partial rebound in activity over the second half of the year following the unprecedented contraction in the spring the inflation forecast for the rest of the year was revised up slightly in response to incoming readings on inflation that were on balance higher than expected nevertheless inflation was still projected to finish the year at a relatively subdued level reflecting substantial margins of slack in labor and product markets and the large declines in consumer energy prices seen earlier in the year in the staffs mediumterm projection the assumption that significant additional fiscal support would not be enacted pointed to a lower trajectory for aggregate demand going forward however recent data on tax receipts also suggested that the fiscal positions of states and localities had deteriorated less than expected which led the staff to boost the projected path of state and local government purchases hence with monetary policy assumed to remain highly accommodative and socialdistancing measures expected to ease further the staff continued to project that real gdp over the medium term would outpace potential leading to a considerable further decline in the unemployment rate the resulting takeup of economic slack was in turn expected to cause inflation to increase gradually and the inflation rate was projected to moderately overshoot percent for some time in the years beyond as monetary policy remained accommodative page federal open market committee the staff continued to observe that the uncertainty related to the future course of the pandemic and its consequences for the economy was high the staff also continued to view the risks to the economic outlook as tilted to the downside with the latest data suggesting an increased probability of a resurgence in the disease participants views on current conditions and the economic outlook participants noted that the covid pandemic was causing tremendous human and economic hardship across the united states and around the world eco nomic activity and employment had continued to re cover but remained well below their levels at the begin ning of the year weaker demand and earlier declines in oil prices had been holding down consumer price infla tion overall financial conditions remained accommo dative in part reflecting policy measures to support the economy and the flow of credit to us households and businesses participants agreed that the path of the economy would depend on the course of the virus and that the ongoing public health crisis would continue to weigh on economic activity employment and inflation in the near term and posed considerable risks to the economys mediumterm outlook participants observed that the economy had registered a rapid though incomplete rebound with thirdquarter real gdp rising at an annual rate of percent reflect ing gains across consumer spending housingsector ac tivity and business equipment investment in recent months however the pace of improvement had moder ated with slower growth expected for the fourth quarter participants noted that economic activity thus far had re covered faster than had been expected earlier in the year household spending on goods especially durable goods had been strong and had moved above its prepandemic level participants commented that the rebound in con sumer spending was due in part to federal stimulus pay ments and expanded unemployment benefits which provided essential support to many households partic ipants viewed accommodative monetary policy as also contributing to gains in durable goods and residential in vestment as well as the surge in home sales in contrast participants noted that consumer outlays for services were increasing more slowly than for durable goods par ticularly for items such as air travel hotel accommoda tions and restaurant meals which had been significantly disrupted by voluntary and mandated socialdistancing measures participants generally expected the strength in household spending to continue especially for dura ble goods and residential investment a few participants noted that households balance sheets generally ap peared healthy and an unwinding of the large pool of household savings accumulated during the pandemic could provide greaterthananticipated momentum to consumer spending over coming months however several participants expressed concern that in the ab sence of additional fiscal support lower and moderate income households might need to reduce their spending sharply when their savings were exhausted a couple of these participants noted reports from their banking con tacts that households appeared to be rapidly exhausting funds they received from fiscal relief programs participants noted that business equipment investment had also picked up a few participants expected the mo mentum in investment to extend into next year as the economic recovery continued while a couple of other participants noted that many businesses in their districts were deferring longerterm commitments because of heighted uncertainty about the economic outlook the recovery was viewed as unevenly distributed across in dustries while many business contacts particularly those in the durable goods or housing industries re ported progress in adapting to the pandemic or im proved business conditions othersespecially those with ties to small businesses and the hospitality aviation and nonresidential construction industrieswere still seeing very difficult circumstances contacts reported improved conditions in the agricultural sector boosted by strong demand from china as well as domestic etha nol production higher crop prices and federal aid pay ments looking ahead some business contacts ex pressed concerns that many households and businesses were currently in a weaker position to weather additional economic shocks than they had been at the beginning of the pandemic participants observed that labor market conditions had continued to improve in recent months with roughly half of the million jobs lost over march and april having been regained the unemployment rate had de clined further and the employment gains since the spring were generally seen as larger than anticipated business contacts in a couple of districtsparticularly those in the manufacturing healthcare and technology sectorsreported having trouble hiring workers for rea sons likely related to virus cases or workers need to pro vide childcare several participants noted that the de cline in the unemployment rate in recent months had been accompanied by a fall in the labor force participa tion rate particularly among those with a high school education or lower and among women although the number of workers on temporary layoff had fallen minutes of the meeting of november page sharply the number of permanent job losers had contin ued to rise most participants commented that the pace of labor market improvement was likely to moderate go ing forward a couple of them noted that many busi nesses in industries severely affected by the pandemic were downsizing or that some businesses were focused on cutting costs or increasing productivity including through automation many participants observed that high rates of job losses had been especially prevalent among lowerwage workers particularly in the services sector and among women african americans and his panics a few participants noted that these trends if slow to reverse could exacerbate racial gender and other socialeconomic disparities in addition a slow job market recovery would cause particular hardship for those with less educational attainment less access to childcare or broadband or greater need for retraining in their comments about inflation participants noted that some consumer prices had increased more quickly than expected in recent months but that broader price trends were still quite soft the upturn in consumer price inflation was primarily attributed to price increases in sectors where the pandemic had induced stronger de mand such as consumer durables in contrast services price inflation remained softer than prepandemic rates as prices for the categories most affected by social dis tancing such as accommodations and airfares contin ued to be very depressed and housing services inflation moderated several participants commented on the un usually large relative price movements caused by the pandemic and the considerable uncertainty as to how long these price changes would persist participants noted that financial conditions were gener ally accommodative and that actions by the federal re serve including the establishment of emergency lending facilities with the approval of and in some cases provi sion of equity investments by the treasury were sup porting the flow of credit to households businesses and communities while these actions were viewed as con tributing to accommodative financial conditions partic ipants noted important differences in credit availability across borrowers in particular financing conditions eased further for residential mortgage borrowers and for large corporations that were able to access capital mar kets but surveys of credit availability indicated that bank lending conditions tightened further a few participants noted that the financing conditions for small businesses were especially worrisome as the ppp had ended and the prospect for additional fiscal support remained un certain they pointed to the most recent census bureau small business pulse survey in which more than half of the respondents reported having no more than two months of cash on hand participants continued to see the uncertainty surround ing the economic outlook as quite elevated with the path of the economy highly dependent on the course of the virus on how individuals businesses and public officials responded to it and on the effectiveness of public health measures to address it participants cited several down side risks that could threaten the recovery while an other broad economic shutdown was seen as unlikely participants remained concerned about the possibility of a further resurgence of the virus that could undermine the recovery the majority of participants also saw the risk that current and expected fiscal support for house holds businesses and state and local governments might not be sufficient to sustain activity levels in those sectors while a few participants noted that additional fiscal stim ulus that was larger than anticipated could be an upside risk some participants commented that the recent surge in virus cases in europe and the reimposition of re strictions there could lead to a slowdown in economic activity in the euro area and have negative spillover ef fects on the us recovery some participants raised con cerns regarding the longerrun effects of the pandemic including sectoral restructurings that could slow employ ment growth or an acceleration of technological disrup tions that could be limiting the pricing power of some firms a number of participants commented on various poten tial risks to financial stability a few participants noted that the banking system showed considerable resilience through the end of the third quarter and a few observed that this resilience partly reflected strongerthanex pected balance sheets of their customers with delin quency rates declining or showing only moderate in creases moreover capital positions and loan loss re serves for large banks were higher than before the pan demic several participants emphasized the need to en sure that banks continue to maintain strong capital lev els as lower levels of capital are typically associated with tighter credit availability from banks several partici pants commented on the vulnerabilities witnessed dur ing the march selloff in the treasury market the sub stantial maturity and liquidity transformations under taken by some nonbank financial institutionssuch as prime mmfs and corporate bond and bank loan mutual fundswere also discussed a couple of participants expressed concerns that a prolonged period of low in terest rates and highly accommodative financial market conditions could lead to excessive risktaking which in page federal open market committee turn could result in elevated firm bankruptcies and sig nificant employment losses in the next economic down turn a few participants noted that climate change poses important challenges to financial stability and welcomed analysis of climate change as both a source of shocks and an underlying vulnerability a couple of participants commented that the actions taken by the federal re serve to support the economy and achieve its mandated goals also supported financial stability relatedly several participants emphasized the important roles various sec tion facilities played in restoring financial market confidence and supporting financial stability they noted that these facilities were still serving as an important backstop in financial markets a few participants noted that it was important to extend them beyond yearend in their consideration of monetary policy at this meeting participants reaffirmed the federal reserves commit ment to using its full range of tools in order to support the us economy during this challenging time thereby promoting the committees statutory goals of maximum employment and price stability participants agreed that the path of the economy would depend significantly on the course of the virus and that the ongoing public health crisis would continue to weigh on economic ac tivity employment and inflation in the near term and posed considerable risks to the economic outlook over the medium term in light of this assessment all partic ipants judged that maintaining an accommodative stance of monetary policy was essential to foster economic re covery and to achieve the committees longrun per cent inflation objective participants remarked that the committees action in september to provide more explicit outcomebased for ward guidance for the federal funds rate had been an im portant step to affirm the committees strong commit ment to the goals and strategy articulated in its revised statement on longerrun goals and monetary policy strategy several participants noted that they were en couraged by evidence that suggested that market partic ipants expectations of the economic conditions that would likely prevail at the time of liftoff seemed broadly consistent with the committees forward guidance and revised consensus statement participants agreed that monetary policy was providing substantial accommodation and most concurred that with the federal funds rate at the elb much of that ac commodation was due to the committees forward guid ance and increases in securities holdings they judged that the current stance of monetary policy remained ap propriate as both employment and inflation remained well short of the committees goals and the uncertainty about the course of the virus and the outlook for the economy continued to be very elevated participants viewed the resurgence of covid cases in the united states and abroad as a downside risk to the recovery a few participants noted that diminished odds for further significant fiscal support also increased downside risks and added to uncertainty about the economic outlook regarding asset purchases participants judged that it would be appropriate over coming months for the fed eral reserve to increase its holdings of treasury securi ties and agency mbs at least at the current pace these actions would continue to help sustain smooth market functioning and help foster accommodative financial conditions thereby supporting the flow of credit to households and businesses many participants judged that the committee might want to enhance its guidance for asset purchases fairly soon most participants fa vored moving to qualitative outcomebased guidance for asset purchases that links the horizon over which the committee anticipates it would be conducting asset pur chases to economic conditions a few participants were hesitant to make changes in the near term to the guid ance for asset purchases and pointed to considerable un certainty about the economic outlook and the appropri ate use of balance sheet policies given that uncertainty discussion on recommended changes to the sum mary of economic projections participants considered two recommendations from the subcommittee on communications for changes to the summary of economic projections sep that would enhance the information provided to the public these recommendations included accelerating the release of the full set of sep exhibits from three weeks after the corresponding fomc meeting when the minutes of that meeting are released to the day of the policy deci sion and adding new charts that display a time series of diffusion indexes for participants judgments of uncer tainty and risks with these recommendations the writ ten summary of the projections that has been included as an addendum to the minutes of the corresponding fomc meeting would be discontinued most of the participants who commented noted that re leasing all sep materials at the time of the postmeeting statement would provide greater context for the policy decision highlight the riskmanagement factors relevant for the decision or further emphasize the degree of un certainty around participants modal projections some who commented noted that the sep serves a valuable role in illustrating how participants policy assessments minutes of the meeting of november page respond to changes in the economic outlook most par ticipants who commented suggested that it would be useful to continue thinking about options for refining the sep participants unanimously supported the rec ommended changes and agreed that they should be im plemented beginning in december committee policy action in their discussion of monetary policy for this meeting members agreed that the covid pandemic was causing tremendous human and economic hardship across the united states and around the world they noted that economic activity and employment had con tinued to recover but remained well below their levels at the beginning of the year and that weaker demand and earlier declines in oil prices had been holding down con sumer price inflation overall financial conditions re mained

posing considerable risks to the economic outlook over the medium term all members reaffirmed that in accordance with the committees goals to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of percent over the longer run and with inflation running persistently below this longer run goal they would aim to achieve inflation moderately above percent for some time so that inflation averages percent over time and longerterm inflation expecta tions remain well anchored at percent members ex pected to maintain an accommodative stance of mone tary policy until those outcomes were achieved all members agreed to maintain the target range for the fed eral funds rate at to percent and they expected that it would be appropriate to maintain this target range un til labor market conditions had reached levels consistent with the committees assessments of maximum employ ment and inflation had risen to percent and was on track to moderately exceed percent for some time in addition members agreed that over coming months it would be appropriate for the federal reserve to increase its holdings of treasury securities and agency mbs at least at the current pace to sustain smooth market func

policy they would continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook and that they would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate in the

range of information in cluding readings on public health labor market condi tions inflation pressures and inflation expectations and financial and international developments at the conclusion of the

of new york developments in financial markets and open market operations the manager of the system open market account soma turned first to a discussion of financial market developments market sentiment improved over the pe riod as reduced uncertainty related to the us election and positive vaccine news outweighed the anticipated ef fect of the ongoing surge in the pandemic us equity price indexes reached alltime highs with the largest gains registered in sectors that have underperformed during the pandemic corporate credit spreads tight ened most notably among lowerrated firms and in sec tors most affected by social distancing measures result ing from the pandemic longerterm treasury yields rose modestly driven by increases in inflation compen sation the positive vaccine news also supported risk sentiment abroad leading many global equity price in dexes to advance and the us dollar to depreciate fur ther market participants had highlighted that uncertainty nevertheless remained high and had pointed to several prominent risks to the economic outlook these risks included the possibility that the vaccine rollout might not proceed as smoothly as anticipated the potential for adverse developments in negotiations concerning the united kingdoms withdrawal from the european un ion and the potential for deterioration in already strained sectors such as those involving small businesses and certain segments of commercial real estate cre with regard to market expectations concerning the pol icy outlook responses to the open market desk surveys of dealers and market

meeting real gdp growth was revised up and the unemployment rate revised down for the fourth quarter relative to the november meeting forecast these revisions reflected incoming data that were on balance better than expected although the re cent resurgence of the pandemic and increased social distancing restrictions in many states and localities were expected to weigh on economic activity in the coming months as a result the staff expected that real gdp growth would temporarily weaken in the first quarter of and the slowing seen in some of the most recent page federal open market committee highfrequency indicators of spending and employment appeared consistent with that forecast the inflation forecast for the rest of was revised down slightly in response to incoming data and inflation was projected to finish the year at a relatively subdued level reflecting substantial margins of labor and productmarket slack in the economy and the large declines in consumer en ergy prices seen earlier in primarily in response to the recent favorable news on the development of covid vaccines the staff re vised up its projection of real gdp growth for as a whole as socialdistancing measures were expected to ease more quickly than previously assumed with mon etary policy assumed to remain highly accommodative the staff continued to project that real gdp growth over the medium term would be well above the rate of poten tial output growth leading to a considerable further de cline in the unemployment rate the resulting takeup of labor and productmarket slack was expected to lead to gradually increasing inflation and for some time in the years beyond inflation was projected to over shoot percent by a moderate amount as monetary pol icy remained accommodative the staff observed that the uncertainty related to the fu ture course of the pandemic the measures to control it and the associated economic effects remained elevated in addition the staff continued to judge the risks to the economic outlook as being tilted to the downside the recent sharp resurgence in the pandemic suggested that the nearterm risks had risen while the recent favorable developments regarding vaccines pointed to some re duction in the downside risks over the medium term participants views on current conditions and the economic outlook in conjunction with this fomc meeting participants submitted their projections of the most likely outcomes for real gdp growth the unemployment rate and infla tion for each year from through and over the longer run based on their individual assessments of ap propriate monetary policy including the path of the fed eral funds rate the longerrun projections represented each participants assessment of the rate to which each variable would be expected to converge over time un der appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy a summary of eco nomic projections sep was released to the public fol lowing the conclusion of the meeting participants noted that the covid pandemic was causing tremendous human and economic hardship across the united states and around the world eco nomic activity and employment had continued to re cover but remained well below their levels at the begin ning of the year weaker demand and earlier declines in oil prices had been holding down consumer price infla tion overall financial conditions remained accommo dative in part reflecting policy measures to support the economy and the flow of credit to us households and businesses participants agreed that the path of the economy would depend on the course of the virus and that the ongoing public health crisis would continue to weigh on economic activity employment and inflation in the near term and posed considerable risks to the eco nomic outlook over the medium term participants observed that the economy continued to show resilience in the face of the pandemic though it was still far from having attained conditions consistent with the committees dual mandate they noted that the economic recovery thus far had been stronger than anticipatedsuggesting greater momentum in eco nomic activity than had been previously thoughtbut viewed the more recent indicators as signaling that the pace of recovery had slowed with the pandemic wors ening across the country the expansion was expected to slow even further in coming months nevertheless the positive vaccine news received over the intermeeting pe riod was viewed as favorable for the mediumterm eco nomic outlook participants noted that household spending on goods especially durables had been strong participants com mented that the rebound in consumer spending was due in part to fiscal programs such as federal stimulus pay ments and expanded unemployment benefits these measures had provided essential support to many house holds the support to incomes provided by fiscal pro grams combined with reduced spending by households on some services had contributed to a historically large increase in aggregate household savings participants also observed that residential investment and home sales remained robust accommodative monetary policy was viewed as having provided support to interest rate sen sitive expenditure categories including residential in vestment and consumer durables spending participants regarded the positive news on vaccine development as further strengthening the mediumterm outlook for household spending however participants saw in creased challenges for the economy in the coming months as the ongoing surge of covid cases and the related mandatory and voluntary measures prompted greater social distancing and damped spending espe cially on services requiring inperson contact several minutes of the meeting of december page participants pointed out that readings on highfrequency economic indicators such as individual mobility indexes and online restaurant reservation data might already be registering the effects of the recent rise in virus cases various participants noted that lowincome households were particularly hard hit by the effects of the resurgent virus and thatwith the looming expiration of the ex panded unemployment benefits eviction moratoria and loan forbearance programstheir situations could dete riorate significantly if additional relief and support did not materialize with respect to the business sector participants ob served that business equipment investment had picked up further with strong readings registered on new or ders and shipments a couple of participants remarked that the very low levels of inventories would likely be a factor supporting increases in production as demand continued to recover participants noted that the eco nomic recovery had been uneven across firms and in dustries though many business contacts particularly those in the durable goods or housing sectors reported progress in adapting to the pandemic and improved business practices othersespecially those closely linked to the leisure travel and hospitality industries were still struggling and their problems were intensify ing because of the resurgence of the virus furthermore while larger firms were generally seen as recovering rea sonably well conditions remained worrisome for small businesses a number of participants noted that many small businesses were in especially vulnerable positions and that further fiscal policy support would help such businesses weather the ongoing surge in the pandemic especially over the coming months looking further ahead participants observed that continuing positive de velopments on the vaccine front could further support business investment by helping reduce stresses in pandemicsensitive industries and by boosting confi dence participants remarked that labor market conditions gen erally had continued to improve but they were still a long way from those consistent with the committees maximum employment goal although the pace of em ployment gains had moderated in recent months the overall recovery in employment thus far had been faster than anticipated with a little more than half of the million jobs lost over march and april having been regained the unemployment rate had declined further although several participants underlined the fact that the labor force participation rate remained below its pre pandemic levellikely reflecting in part health con cerns and additional childcare responsibilities associated with online schooling participants assessed that the on going surge in covid infections would be particu larly challenging for the labor market in coming months but they indicated that they expected employment to continue to recover over the medium term participants stressed that the burdens of the economic downturn had fallen unequally on different groups in particular high rates of job losses had been especially prevalent among lowerwage workers and among african americans and hispanics some participants expressed the concern that the longer the pandemic continued the more lasting damage to the labor market there could be they noted that the number of unemployed workers who had been permanently laid off had increased notably in recent months and that those workers historically often re quired a longer time to find a new job than those tem porarily laid off in light of these considerations several participants assessed that improvements in the labor market were lagging that of economic activity and they indicated that they had not revised their projections of labor market variables to the same extent as their revi sion of the outlook for economic activity in their comments about inflation participants noted that increases in consumer prices had been soft of late as prices of products in those categories most affected by social distancingsuch as hotel accommodations and air travelcontinued to be depressed and increases in rents remained low these patterns were expected to continue in the near term as pandemic concerns intensi fied over the winter however participants generally saw these downward pressures on inflation starting to abate next year with widespread distribution of vaccines reducing socialdistancing concerns and spurring eco nomic activity a couple of participants suggested that as a result of ongoing technologyenabled disruption to business models and practices or lasting pandemic induced restraint on firms pricing power downward pressure on inflation could persist several participants noted a pickup in marketbased measures of inflation compensation participants expected that with contin ued monetary policy support inflation would rise over time in their sep submissions seven participants five more than in the september sepexpected overall inflation to be above the committees percent longer run objective in participants noted that overall financial conditions were accommodative in part reflecting policy measures to support the economy and the flow of credit to house holds and businesses however participants underlined important differences in credit availability across bor rowers financing conditions eased further for large page federal open market committee corporations that were able to access capital markets as equity prices rose and corporate credit spreads contin ued to narrow but smaller firms and some households reliant on bank lending continued to face tight lending standards participants noted that the financing condi tions for small businesses were especially strained with a few participants pointing out that a sizable fraction of small businesses had permanently closed or were in the process of transitioning to closure a couple of partici pants observed that aggregate banking data had not in dicated a significant increase in loan delinquencies for ci loans thus far though this development could be partly due to the cares act provisions that provided relief to many troubled borrowers or to the fact that many small businesses had gone out of business without declaring bankruptcy or defaulting on loans some par ticipants noted the important role played by the various section facilities implemented in in serving as temporary backstops to key credit markets and in help ing to restore and maintain the flow of credit to house holds businesses and communities these participants also mentioned the announcement that cares act funding to support new activity in many of these facili ties would not be available after december and a number noted that they saw downside risks associated with this development participants continued to see the uncertainty surround ing the economic outlook as elevated with the path of the economy highly dependent on the course of the vi rus the positive vaccine news was seen as reducing downside risks over the medium term and a number of participants saw risks to economic activity as more bal anced than earlier still participants saw significant un certainties regarding how quickly the deployment of vac cines would proceed as well as how different members of the public would respond to the availability of vac cines participants cited several downside risks that could threaten the economic recovery these risks in cluded the possibility of significant additional fiscal pol icy support not materializing in a timely manner the po tential for further adverse pandemic developments which could lead to morestringent restrictions more severe business failures and more permanent job lossesand the chance that trade negotiations between the united kingdom and the european union would not be concluded successfully before the december deadline as upside risks participants mentioned the prospect that the release of pentup demand spurred by widerscale vaccinations and easing of social distancing could boost spending and bring individuals back to the labor force more quickly than currently expected as well as the possibility that fiscal policy developments could see measures that were larger than expected in amount or economic impact regarding inflation participants generally viewed the risks as having become more bal anced than they were earlier in the year though most still viewed the risks as being weighted to the downside as an upside risk to inflation a few participants noted the potential for a strongerthanexpected recovery coupled with the possible emergence of pandemicrelated supply constraints to boost inflation in their consideration of monetary policy at this meeting participants reaffirmed the federal reserves commit ment to using its full range of tools to support the us economy during this challenging time thereby promot ing the committees statutory goals of maximum em ployment and price stability participants agreed that the path of the economy would depend significantly on the course of the virus and that the ongoing public health crisis would continue to weigh on economic activity em ployment and inflation in the near term participants noted that with the pandemic worsening across the country the expansion would likely slow in coming months in contrast for the medium term participants commented that positive vaccine news had improved the economic outlook that said participants agreed that the path ahead remained highly uncertain and that the economy remained far from the committees longer run goals in light of this assessment all participants judged that maintaining an accommodative stance of monetary policy was essential to foster economic recov ery and to achieve an average inflation rate of percent over time all participants supported enhancing the committees guidance on asset purchases at this meeting and in par ticular adopting qualitative outcomebased guidance in dicating that increases in asset holdings would continue with purchases of treasury securities of at least bil lion per month and of agency mbs of at least billion per month until substantial further progress has been made toward reaching the committees maximum em ployment and price stability goals in their discussions of this change participants noted that the new guidance regarding balance sheet policy brought the statements references to purchases into better alignment with the committees outcomebased guidance on the federal funds rate offered more clarity about the role played by the asset purchase program in providing accommoda tion to meet the committees economic goals and un derscored the responsiveness of balance sheet policy to unanticipated economic developments a few partici pants stressed that all of the committees policy tools minutes of the meeting of december page were now well positioned to respond to the evolution of the economy for example if progress toward the com mittees goals proved slower than anticipated the new guidance relayed the committees intention to respond by increasing monetary policy accommodation through maintaining the current level of the target range of the federal funds rate for longer and raising the expected path of the federal reserves balance sheet a couple of participants remarked that against this background it was important to convey to the public that the federal funds rate remained the committees primary policy tool a number of participants discussed considerations re lated to determining the eventual attainment of sub stantial further progress toward reaching the commit tees maximum employment and price stability goals participants commented that this judgment would be broad qualitative and not based on specific numerical criteria or thresholds various participants noted the im portance of the committee clearly communicating its as sessment of actual and expected progress toward its longerrun goals well in advance of the time when it could be judged substantial enough to warrant a change in the pace of purchases regarding the decisions on the pace and composition of the committees asset purchases all participants judged that it would be appropriate to continue those purchases at least at the current pace and nearly all favored main taining the current composition of purchases although a couple of participants indicated that they were open to weighting purchases of treasury securities toward longer maturities participants generally judged that the asset purchase program as structured was providing very significant policy accommodation some participants noted that the committee could consider future adjust ments to its asset purchasessuch as increasing the pace of securities purchases or weighting purchases of treas ury securities toward those that had longer remaining maturitiesif such adjustments were deemed appropri ate to support the attainment of the committees objec tives a few participants underlined the importance of continuing to evaluate the balance of costs and risks as sociated with asset purchases against the benefits arising from purchases participants shared their views on the appropriate evo lution of asset purchases once substantial further pro gress had been made toward the committees maximum employment and price stability goals a number of par ticipants noted that once such progress had been at tained a gradual tapering of purchases could begin and the process thereafter could generally follow a sequence similar to the one implemented during the largescale purchase program in and committee policy action in their discussion of monetary policy for this meeting members agreed that the covid pandemic was causing tremendous human and economic hardship across the united states and around the world they noted that economic activity and employment had con tinued to recover but remained well below their levels at the beginning of the year and that weaker demand and earlier declines in oil prices had been holding down con sumer price inflation overall

some time so that inflation averages percent over time and longerterm inflation expecta tions remain well anchored at percent members ex pected to maintain an accommodative stance of mone tary policy until those outcomes were achieved all members agreed to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at to percent and they expected that it would be appropriate to maintain this target range

some time in addition members agreed that it would be appropri ate for the federal reserve to continue to increase its holdings of treasury securities by at least billion per month and agency mbs by

committee reaffirmed its pro gram for security of fomc information with minor technical changes in the committees annual reconsideration of the state ment on longerrun goals and monetary policy strat egy all participants supported the statement as written and the committee voted unanimously to reaffirm without revision statement on longerrun goals and monetary policy strategy as reaffirmed effective january the federal open market committee fomc is firmly committed to fulfilling its statutory mandate from the congress of promoting maximum employment sta ble prices and moderate longterm interest rates the committee seeks to explain its monetary policy deci sions to the public as clearly as possible such clarity facilitates wellinformed decisionmaking by households and businesses reduces economic and financial uncer tainty increases the effectiveness of monetary policy and enhances transparency and accountability which are essential in a democratic society employment inflation and longterm interest rates fluctuate over time in response to economic and finan cial disturbances monetary policy plays an important role in stabilizing the economy in response to these dis turbances the committees primary means of adjusting the stance of monetary policy is through changes in the target range for the federal funds rate the committee judges that the level of the federal funds rate consistent with maximum employment and price stability over the longer run has declined relative to its historical average therefore the federal funds rate is likely to be con strained by its effective lower bound more frequently page federal open market committee than in the past owing in part to the proximity of in terest rates to the effective lower bound the committee judges that downward risks to employment and inflation have increased the committee is prepared to use its full range of tools to achieve its maximum employment and price stability goals the maximum level of employment is a broadbased and inclusive goal that is not directly measurable and changes over time owing largely to nonmonetary factors that affect the structure and dynamics of the labor mar ket consequently it would not be appropriate to spec ify a fixed goal for employment rather the committees policy decisions must be informed by assessments of the shortfalls of employment from its maximum level rec ognizing that such assessments are necessarily uncertain and subject to revision the committee considers a wide range of indicators in making these assessments the inflation rate over the longer run is primarily de termined by monetary policy and hence the committee has the ability to specify a longerrun goal for inflation the committee reaffirms its judgment that inflation at the rate of percent as measured by the annual change in the price index for personal consumption expendi tures is most consistent over the longer run with the federal reserves statutory mandate the committee judges that longerterm inflation expectations that are well anchored at percent foster price stability and mod erate longterm interest rates and enhance the commit tees ability to promote maximum employment in the face of significant economic disturbances in order to anchor longerterm inflation expectations at this level the committee seeks to achieve inflation that averages percent over time and therefore judges that following periods when inflation has been running persistently be low percent appropriate monetary policy will likely aim to achieve inflation moderately above percent for some time monetary policy actions tend to influence economic activity employment and prices with a lag in setting monetary policy the committee seeks over time to mit igate shortfalls of employment from the committees as sessment of its maximum level and deviations of infla tion from its longerrun goal moreover sustainably achieving maximum employment and price stability de pends on a stable financial system therefore the com mittees policy decisions reflect its longerrun goals its mediumterm outlook and its assessments of the bal ance of risks including risks to the financial system that could impede the attainment of the committees goals the committees employment and inflation objectives are generally complementary however under circum stances in which the committee judges that the objec tives are not complementary it takes into account the employment shortfalls and inflation deviations and the potentially different time horizons over which employ ment and inflation are projected to return to levels judged consistent with its mandate the committee intends to review these principles and to make adjustments as appropriate at its annual organi zational meeting each january and to undertake roughly every years a thorough public review of its monetary policy strategy tools and communication practices developments in financial markets and open market operations the manager turned first to a discussion of financial market developments the evolving outlooks for the path of the virus and for fiscal policy were the main driv ers of financial markets over the intermeeting period progress on vaccinations had been slower than expected and the nearterm trajectory of the pandemic worsened weighing on economic activity however even with the appearance of new strains of the virus market confi dence in the ultimate efficacy of the vaccination efforts seemed to remain high the emergence of a narrow democratic majority in the senate bolstered investor ex pectations for additional fiscal stimulus prompting up ward revisions to forecasts for economic growth this year in the open market desk survey of primary deal ers the median gross domestic product gdp growth forecast rose about percentage point against this backdrop longerterm treasury yields rose notably over the period longerdated real yields were lifted by expectations for improved growth and in creased treasury issuance but remained deeply negative measures of inflation compensation increased over the period with the fiveyear fiveyearforward measure ris ing to a level of around percent overall financial con ditions eased further on net as the recent rally in risk assets continued gains in us equities again centered on cyclical sectors and smallercapitalization firms most sensitive to growth credit spreads narrowed further especially for riskier borrowers expectations for the path of the target federal funds rate over the next several years as implied by interest rate futures and by the desk survey of primary dealers and survey of market participants were relatively little changed from december the stability in nearterm pol icy rate expectations amid an improving growth outlook appeared consistent with the committees new frame work and forward interest rate guidance although the median desk survey respondent continued to expect minutes of the meeting of january page month personal consumption expenditure pce in flation of percent when the fomc first lifts the tar get range the median expectation for the unemployment rate prevailing at that time was modestly lower than in december the desk survey results indicated that a ma jority of market participants anticipated that the pace of net asset purchases would remain stable for the remain der of the year and slow around the first quarter of the manager next discussed conditions in funding mar kets over the yearend overnight secured and unse cured rates were little changed at rates just below the in terest on excess reserves ioer rate even as financial firms managed their balance sheets for the reporting date going forward reserves were projected to rise rap idly through the summer reflecting ongoing federal re serve asset purchases as well as expected declines in bal ances held in the treasury general account market pricing suggested that the effective federal funds rate was expected to decline modestly through the second quarter even if more notable downward pressure on money market rates emerged the manager anticipated that the federal reserves tools including the ioer rate and overnight reverse repurchase agreement facility would continue to provide effective control over the federal funds rate and other overnight money market rates finally the manager discussed desk operations a range of indicators suggested that both fixedincome and funding markets continued to function smoothly over the period the manager noted that in the coming pe riod the desk anticipated implementing two adjust ments to continue to normalize operations first given the sustained stability in term repurchase markets the desk proposed discontinuing the weekly onemonth term repurchase operations beginning in midfebruary in addition the desk planned to reduce the frequency of agency commercial mortgagebacked securities cmbs operations in light of the sustained improve ment in market conditions for these securities by unanimous vote the committee ratified the desks domestic transactions over the intermeeting period no intervention operations occurred in foreign currencies for the systems account during the intermeeting period staff review of the economic situation the covid pandemic and the measures undertaken to contain its spread continued to affect economic activ ity in the united states and abroad the information available at the time of the january meeting sug gested that us real gdp had continued to advance in the fourth quarter of albeit at a pace that was mark edly slower than the rapid rate seen in the third quarter while the level of real gdp had not yet returned to the level seen before the onset of the pandemic labor mar ket conditions deteriorated on balance in december and employment continued to be well below its level at the start of consumer price inflation through no vemberas measured by the month percentage change in the pce price indexremained considerably lower than the rates seen in early total nonfarm payroll employment fell in december with especially sharp declines in the leisure and hospital ity sector as of december payroll employment had re traced a little more than half of the losses seen at the onset of the pandemic the unemployment rate held steady at percent in december the unemployment rate for african americans declined and the hispanic unemployment rate rose both rates remained well above the national average however the asian unemploy ment rate moved below the national average in decem ber both the labor force participation rate and employ menttopopulation ratio were unchanged in december initial claims for unemployment insurance in midjanu ary were higher than their early december level weekly estimates of privatesector payrolls constructed by fed eral reserve board staff using data provided by the pay roll processor adp indicated that the fourweek average change in private employment in midjanuary was slightly lower than it had been in early december how ever the most recent weektoweek changes in this measure of payrolls had been highly volatile average hourly earnings for all employees rose per cent over the months ending in december a gain that was noticeably higher than the measures yearearlier month change the month change in average hourly earnings continued to be dominated by changes in the composition of the workforce with the concen tration of job losses among lowerwage workers over the pandemic period resulting in outsized increases in this measure of earnings that were not indicative of tight la bor market conditions by contrast a staff measure of the month change in the median wage derived from the adp dataa measure likely to have been less af fected by changes in workforce compositionwas percent in december and remained well below its prepandemic pace total pce price inflation was percent over the months ending in november and continued to be held down by relatively weak aggregate demand and the declines in consumer energy prices seen over the first page federal open market committee part of core pce price inflation which excludes changes in consumer energy prices and many consumer food prices was percent over the months ending in november while the trimmed mean measure of month pce inflation constructed by the federal re serve bank of dallas was percent in november in december the month change in the consumer price index cpi was percent while core cpi inflation was percent over the same period the latest read ings on surveybased measures of longerrun inflation expectations ticked higher in the first part of january the university of michigan surveys of consumers meas ure for the next to years moved back up to its latesummer level while in december the yearahead measure of inflation expectations produced by the fed eral reserve bank of new york moved back up to its august level real pce fell in november and available indicators including the components of the nominal retail sales data used to estimate pcepointed to a further decline in december housing starts and construction permits moved up in november and december and finished the year well above their prepandemic levels although home sales turned down in november the decline ap peared to reflect limited availability of homes for sale ra ther than weakening demand available indicators pointed to a strong increase in in vestment in equipment and intangibles in the fourth quarter of as this component of capital spending recovered from its sharp decline over the first half of the year likewise drilling investment appeared to have turned up sharply albeit from a low level as oil prices moved higher by contrast investment in nonresidential structures outside of the drilling and mining sector ap peared to have declined further in the fourth quarter and had likely been restrained by firms continued hesitation to commit to projects with lengthy times to completion and uncertain future returns industrial production advanced further in the fourth quarter led by a solid gain in manufacturing output but had not yet overtaken its prepandemic level the low level of export demand since the onset of the pandemic had likely continued to restrain the recovery in the man ufacturing sector in addition production of motor ve hicles and parts was a small drag on manufacturing out put in the fourth quarter as automotive producers ap peared to have had difficulty getting assemblies fully un der way for the new model year total real government purchases appeared to have fallen further in the fourth quarter though at a slower pace than in the third quarter available data suggested that real federal purchases had posted a modest gain as an increase in defense purchases offset a reduction in non defense purchases however indicators of real state and local purchases including state and local government employment pointed to a fourthquarter decline similar in size to what had been seen in the third quarter the nominal us international trade deficit widened fur ther in november both imports and exports continued to rebound from their collapse in the first half of the year goods imports rose in november to a level well above that of the previous january with gains in most major categories although exports also grew in no vember they had not yet recovered to their january level services trade continued a gradual rise but re mained depressed driven by the continued suspension of most international travel taken together these data suggested that net exports made a significant negative contribution to real gdp growth in the fourth quarter recent data pointed to a sharp slowing in foreign eco nomic growth in the fourth quarter after a strong re bound in the third quarter amid a further intensifica tion of the pandemic many foreign governments tight ened socialdistancing restrictions in a few countries the emergence of new and more contagious virus strains was accompanied by a surge in covid cases and deaths the increased virus spread and restrictions ap peared to take a toll on foreign economic activity par

on balance charac terized the financial vulnerabilities of the us financial system as notable the staff assessed asset valuation pressures as elevated in particular corporate bond spreads had declined to prepandemic levels which were at the lower ends of their historical distributions in ad dition measures of the equity risk premium declined fur ther returning to prepandemic levels prices for indus trial and multifamily properties continued to grow through at about the same pace as in the past sev eral years while prices of office buildings and retail es tablishments started to fall the staff assessed vulnera bilities associated with household and business borrow ing as notable reflecting increased leverage and de creased incomes and revenues in small businesses were hit particularly hard the staff judged that vulner minutes of the meeting of january page abilities stemming from financial leverage were moder ate noting that capital ratios at the largest bank holding companies rose over the course of last year leverage among hedge funds was elevated but it did decline last spring for the most highly leveraged funds the staff characterized vulnerabilities stemming from funding risks as moderate banks continued to maintain signifi cant levels of highquality liquid assets and stable sources of funding in contrast money market funds and open ended mutual funds were characterized by significant vulnerabilities associated with liquidity transformation staff economic outlook the us economic projection prepared by the staff for the january fomc meeting implied a considerably stronger outlook for activity in relative to the de cember forecast although incoming data had been weaker than expected the staffs january projection in corporated the effects of the stimulus in the recently en acted consolidated appropriations act caa to gether with an assumption that an additional sizable tranche of fiscal support would be put into place in com ing months taken together these stimulus measures were expected to partly offset the substantial drag on ag gregate demand that would result from the unwinding of the fiscal stimulus enacted in the spring of the staffs projection continued to anticipate that widespread vaccination would allow for an easing in social distanc ing in with the boost to growth from the reduc tion in social distancing assumed to be largely completed by the end of gdp growth was expected to step down over the remainder of the medium term even so the staff continued to project that real gdp growth would outpace that of potential over this period leading to a considerable further decline in the unemployment rate the month changes in total and core pce prices in coming months were projected to briefly move above percent in the second quarter of as the unusually low observations from the spring of drop out of the month calculation following these swings infla tion was expected to finish the year at just below per cent thereafter inflation was projected to gradually edge up to percent by the end of the medium term as labor and product markets tightened with monetary policy assumed to remain accommodative inflation was projected to moderately overshoot percent for some time in the years beyond the staff viewed the possibility that a largerthanantici pated fiscal package would be enacted in coming months as a modest upside risk to the baseline economic out look however the further rise in covid cases in the united states coupled with developments such as the emergence of morecontagious strains of the virus in the united states and elsewhere led the staff to continue to judge that the risks to the baseline projection were skewed to the downside and that the uncertainty around the forecast was elevated participants views on current conditions and the economic outlook participants noted that the covid pandemic was causing tremendous human and economic hardship across the united states and around the world the pace of the recovery in economic activity and employment had moderated in recent months with weakness concen trated in the sectors of the economy most adversely af fected by the resurgence of the virus and by greater so cial distancing weaker demand and earlier declines in oil prices were holding down consumer price inflation overall financial conditions remained accommodative in part reflecting the federal reserves actions to sup port the economy and the flow of credit to us house holds and businesses participants agreed that the path of the economy would depend significantly on the course of the virus including progress on vaccinations and that the ongoing public health crisis would continue to weigh on economic activity employment and infla tion and posed considerable risks to the economic out look participants observed that the resurgence in covid infections and associated socialdistancing measures were restraining activity in some sectors particularly in industries such as travel and leisure and hospitality most participants expected that the stimulus provided by the passage of the caa in december the likelihood of additional fiscal support and anticipated continued pro gress in vaccinations would lead to a sizable boost in economic activity even so participants noted that eco nomic activity and employment were currently well be low levels consistent with achieving maximum employ ment participants commented on improved prospects for household spending over the course of the year in part reflecting fiscal support they saw progress on vaccina tions as essential for supporting further gains in aggre gate consumer spending and for the economic recovery more generally in commenting on recent data for household spending most participants discussed the composition of expenditures with strong spending on page federal open market committee many goods especially durables and weakness in spend ing on some services especially in travel and in leisure and hospitality the relative strength in consumer spending on goods was supported by fiscal programs such as federal stimulus payments and expanded unem ployment benefits as well as by accommodative mone tary policy the weakness in services spending was largely attributed to the pandemic and associated social distancing measures which limited spending on services that depend heavily on inperson contact increased government transfers to households combined with re duced outlays on some services had contributed to a his torically large increase in aggregate household savings last year participants also observed that residential in vestment and home sales remained robust low interest rates were viewed as an important factor supporting the strength in housing activity most participants noted that the economic downturn had not fallen equally on all americans and that those least able to shoulder the burdenin particular lower income and black and hispanic householdshad been the hardest hit by the pandemic many participants stressed that sustained support from fiscal policy would help address the hardships faced by these groups and that monetary policy could also help by promoting the economys return to maximum employment and price stability in their remarks on the business sector participants commented that business equipment investment had continued to show strength while nonresidential con struction remained weak participants also discussed the recent strong performance of the manufacturing sector many discussed supply chain issues in manufacturing in cluding those associated with acquiring material inputs and pandemicrelated worker shortages and absentee ism business contacts reported that firms in goodspro ducing industries particularly larger firms and those in the durable goods or housing sectors were adapting to the pandemic in contrast smaller firms and those in in dustries most adversely affected by the pandemic were finding it more difficult to adapt many participants stated that their business contacts were optimistic that continued progress on vaccinations together with fur ther fiscal support would result in more improvement in overall business conditions several participants noted the increase in agricultural crop prices over and the associated improvement in farm revenues as with overall economic activity the pace of improve ment in the labor market had slowed in recent months payroll employment fell in december as continued job gains in many industries were outweighed by significant layoffs in industries where the resurgence of the virus had weighed heavily on activity while labor market conditions had improved significantly on balance since the spring some participants noted that if the sizable number of workers who reported having left the labor force since the beginning of the pandemic were to be counted as unemployed the unemployment rate would be substantially higher participants judged that the cur rent low level of labor force participation likely reflected a number of factors including health concerns and ad ditional childcare responsibilities over the medium term participants expected strong growth in employ ment driven by continued progress on vaccinations and an associated rebound of economic activity and of con sumer and business confidence as well as accommoda tive fiscal and monetary policy however participants observed that the economy was far from achieving the committees broadbased and inclusive goal of maxi mum employment and that even with a brisk pace of im provement in the labor market achieving this goal would take some time in their comments about inflation participants noted that headline pce price inflation in december meas ured on a month basis was poised to come in well below the committees percent longerterm objective in the relatively near term a number of participants sug gested that there could be increases in the prices of some goods whose production has been subject to supply chain constraints or soon could be others anticipated that a possibly abrupt return to normal levels of activity could result in onetime increases in certain prices many participants stressed the importance of distin guishing between such onetime changes in relative prices and changes in the underlying trend for inflation noting that changes in relative prices could temporarily raise measured inflation but would be unlikely to have a lasting effect some participants further observed that month pce inflation was likely to move somewhat above percent for a brief period in the spring as the unusually low monthly observations from last spring roll out of the month calculation outside of such near term fluctuations participants generally anticipated that inflation would move up along a trajectory consistent with achieving the committees objectives over time supported by stronger economic activity widespread vaccinations and the associated reduction in social dis tancing and accommodative fiscal and monetary policy some participants pointed to the continued increase in marketbased measures of inflation compensation from the very low levels recorded in the spring as consistent minutes of the meeting of january page with the view that inflation was likely to move up grad ually over time others noted that surveybased measures were little changed on net over the year as a whole participants noted that overall financial conditions re mained highly accommodative in part reflecting inves tors optimism about the economic outlook along with the accommodative stance of monetary policy and re cent and expected future fiscal policy measures how ever a few participants remarked that credit conditions were relatively tight for borrowers with low credit scores and for some small and mediumsized businesses that rely on bank lending rather than capital markets to meet their financing needs while generally acknowledging that the mediumterm outlook for real gdp growth and employment had im proved participants continued to see the uncertainty surrounding that outlook as elevated participants agreed that the path of the economy depended signifi cantly on the course of the virus and progress on vac cinations many participants remarked that the pan demic continued to pose considerable risks to the eco nomic outlook including risks associated with new virus strains potential public resistance to vaccination and potential difficulties in the production and distribution of vaccines with regard to upside risks some partici pants pointed to the possibility that fiscal policy could turn out to be more expansionary than anticipated that households could display greater willingness to spend out of accumulated savings than expected or that wide spread vaccinations and easing of social distancing could result in a more rapid boost to spending and employ ment than anticipated participants generally viewed the risks to the outlook for inflation as having become more balanced than was the case over most of although most still viewed the risks as weighted to the downside as an upside risk to inflation several participants noted the potential for pandemicrelated supply constraints to affect price inflation somewhat more than anticipated or for price increases among industries most adversely af fected by the pandemic to be more pronounced than projected a number of participants commented on issues related to financial stability several participants noted areas of strength for example the banking system had shown considerable resilience since the onset of the pandemic banks capital positions had generally remained solid and earnings were strong in addition results from the most recent stress tests indicated that the largest banks could withstand very stressed economic conditions that said a few participants stated that it would be im portant to stay vigilant to ensure that the banking system remained strong and resilient in addition several par ticipants noted that the pandemic had highlighted struc tural vulnerabilities in other parts of the financial system these included runprone investment funds in short term funding and credit markets as well as fragilities in treasury market functioning stresses stemming from these vulnerabilities had required substantial interven tion by the federal reserve in the turbulent market con ditions at the onset of the pandemic a couple of par ticipants commented that it would be important for the appropriate regulatory bodies to address these financial stability vulnerabilities regarding asset valuations some participants commented that equity valuations had risen further that initial public offering activity was ele vated or that valuations might have been affected by re tail investors trading through electronic platforms in addition risk spreads on corporate bonds and loans were generally low even with corporate indebtedness having risen to high levels a few participants noted that some cre in sectors that had been most directly af fected by the pandemicsuch as those involving retail establishments and hotelsfaced the prospect of falling prices and increased stress in their consideration of monetary policy at this meeting participants reaffirmed the federal reserves commit ment to using its full range of tools to support the us economy during this challenging time thereby pro moting the committees statutory goals of maximum employment and price stability participants agreed that the path of the economy would depend significantly on the course of the virus including progress on vaccina tions and that the ongoing public health crisis had con tinued to weigh on economic activity employment and inflation participants noted that as the pandemic had worsened across the country in recent months the pace of the recovery had moderated with weakness concen trated in the sectors most adversely affected by the pan demic in contrast participants remarked that the pro spect of an effective vaccine program the recently en acted fiscal support and the potential for additional fis cal actions had led them to judge that the mediumterm outlook had improved that said participants agreed that the economy remained far from the committees longerrun goals and that the path ahead remained highly uncertain with the pandemic continuing to pose consid erable risks to the outlook in their discussion of the outlook for monetary policy participants judged that maintaining a highly accommo dative stance of policy was essential to foster further page federal open market committee economic recovery and to achieve an average inflation rate of percent over time participants noted that eco nomic conditions were currently far from the commit tees longerrun goals and that the stance for policy would need to remain accommodative until those goals were achieved consequently all participants supported maintaining the committees current settings and out comebased guidance for the federal funds rate and the pace of asset purchases participants noted that the committees current guid ance was well suited to the current environment because it describes how policy would respond based on the path of the economy for example if progress toward the committees goals proved slower than anticipated the outcomebased guidance would convey the committees intention to respond by increasing monetary policy ac commodation through maintaining the current level of the target range of the federal funds rate for longer and raising the expected path of the federal reserves bal ance sheet in addition participants noted that the com mittees current outcomebased guidance for both the federal funds rate and balance sheet appeared to be well understood by the public in that context participants emphasized that it was important to abstract from tem porary factors affecting inflationsuch as low past lev els of prices dropping out of measures of annual price changes or relative price increases in some sectors brought about by supply constraints or disruptionsin judging whether inflation was on track to moderately ex ceed percent for some time participants noted that the increase in the federal re serves balance sheet since last march had materially eased financial conditions and was providing substantial support to the economy the committees guidance for asset purchases indicated that asset purchases would continue at least at the current pace until substantial fur ther progress toward its employment and inflation goals had been achieved with the economy still far from those goals participants judged that it was likely to take some time for substantial further progress to be achieved various participants noted the importance of the committee clearly communicating its assessment of progress toward its longerrun goals well in advance of the time when it could be judged substantial enough to warrant a change in the pace of purchases committee policy action in their discussion of monetary policy for this meeting members agreed that the covid pandemic was causing tremendous human and economic hardship across the united states and around the world they noted that the pace of recovery in economic activity and employment had moderated in recent months with weakness concentrated in sectors most adversely af fected by the pandemic weaker demand and earlier de clines in oil prices had been holding down consumer price inflation overall financial conditions remained ac commodative

course of the virus including progress on vaccinations in addition members agreed that the ongoing public health crisis had continued to weigh on economic activ ity employment and inflation and was posing consider able risks to the economic outlook members agreed that the pandemic continued to pose considerable risks to the outlook nonetheless in light of the expected progress on vaccinations and the change in the outlook for fiscal policy the mediumterm pro spects for the economy had improved enough that members decided that the reference in previous post meeting statements to risks to the economic outlook over the medium term was no longer warranted members agreed that the federal reserve was commit ted to using its full range of tools to support the us economy in this challenging time thereby promoting its maximumemployment and pricestability goals all members reaffirmed that in accordance with the com mittees goals to achieve maximum employment and in flation at the rate of percent over the longer run and with inflation running persistently below this longerrun goal they would aim to achieve inflation moderately above percent for some time so that inflation averages percent over time and longerterm inflation expecta tions remain well anchored at percent members ex pected to maintain an accommodative stance of mone tary policy until those outcomes were achieved all members agreed to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at to percent and they expected that it would be appropriate to maintain this target range until labor market conditions had reached levels con sistent with the committees assessments of maximum employment and inflation had risen to percent and was on track to moderately exceed percent for some time in addition members agreed that it would be appropri ate for the federal reserve to continue to increase its holdings of treasury securities by at least billion per month and agency mortgagebacked securities by at least billion per month until substantial further progress minutes of the meeting of january page had been made toward the committees maximumem ployment and pricestability goals they judged that these asset purchases would help foster smooth market functioning and accommodative financial conditions thereby supporting the flow of credit to households and businesses members agreed that in assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy they would continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook and that they would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate in the event that risks emerged that could impede the attainment of the committees goals members also agreed that in as sessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy they would take into account a wide range of information in cluding readings on public health labor market condi tions inflation pressures and inflation expectations and financial and international developments at the conclusion of the discussion the committee voted to authorize and direct the federal reserve bank of new york until instructed otherwise to execute transactions in the soma in

rules regarding availability of infor mation which are the committees freedom of infor mation act foia rules the revised foia rules which include a range of minor and technical updates will become effective days after the forthcoming pub lication of the final rule in the federal register developments in financial markets and open market operations the manager turned first to a discussion of financial market developments in the united states the trend toward higher longerterm yields observed in recent months accelerated over the intermeeting period and farforward real rates based on treasury inflation protected securities tips rose considerably market participants highlighted an improving economic out look bolstered by passage of the american rescue plan arp and progress on vaccinations as underlying the increase in yields model and surveybased estimates suggested that a significant portion of the increase in yields was associated with an increase in term premiums higher term premiums could reflect the outlook for more expansive fiscal policy and an associated upward revision in the expected path for treasury debt out standing increased uncertainty over the outlook for longerterm interest rates as well as technical factors may also have contributed to the rise in term premiums the treasury market functioned well over most of the pe riod although measures of market liquidity deteriorated somewhat toward the end of february conditions gradually improved although some measures of market liquidity had not fully returned to earlier levels page federal open market committee rates implied by interest rate futures maturing over the next several years rose notably over the intermeeting pe riod reportedly reflecting a reassessment by market par ticipants of the expected path of the target range for the federal funds rate since the january meeting the date of the first increase in the target range for the federal funds rate implied by a straight read of market pricing moved notably earlier to the first quarter of and the implied target rate at the end of rose around basis points however responses to the open mar ket desk surveys suggested more modest changes to policy rate expectations the probabilityweighted mean survey expectation for the target rate at the end of rose only around basis points expectations for economic conditions at the time of the first increase in the target range as measured by the desk surveys appeared to remain broadly consistent with the committees policy framework and forward guidance expectations from the desk surveys for the path of asset purchases were little changed contacts noted that these expectations have been held steady by policymaker communications emphasizing both the need to see realized progress toward the committees goals and the intent to communicate well in advance of the time when progress could be judged substantial enough to warrant a change in the pace of purchases alongside the rise in us yields broad us equity price indexes increased moderately with the largest gains in cyclically sensitive sectors the rise in us yields was also accompanied by increases in sovereign yields in other advanced economies some central banks re sponded to these yield increases with adjustments to op erations others suggested that the rising yields reflected improvements in the outlook the deputy manager discussed the evolution of the fed eral reserves balance sheet and related developments in money markets reserve balances rose more than billion on net over the intermeeting period to trillion while treasury bills outstanding decreased more than billion against this backdrop the ef fective federal funds rate softened modestly while re purchase agreement repo rates declined to a greater ex tent moreover market participants projected that re serves would grow at a historically rapid pace in coming months reflecting continued expansion of the federal reserves balance sheet along with a projected draw down in the balances maintained in the treasury general account market contacts suggested that continued rapid expansion of reserves could put further downward pressure on money market rates the deputy manager noted that the earliest and most pronounced pressure was likely to be observed in overnight secured financing markets and there could be increasing usage of the over night reverse repurchase agreement on rrp facility in light of the potential for expanded use of the on rrp facility the staff had conducted a review to ensure that the terms of the facility and its counterparty base were well positioned to continue to support effective policy implementation by offering a broad range of money market lenders an outside investment option the on rrp facility enhances lenders bargaining power in negotiating rates on shortterm private investments and thus helps establish a floor on overnight money market rates the facility can also alleviate downward pressure on overnight rates associated with reserve growth by broadening the range of liabilities that support the fed eral reserves balance sheet expansion the review rec ommended raising the on rrp percounterparty limit from billion to billion the billion limit had been established a number of years ago and the amount of credit intermediated through money markets had grown substantially since then the increase in the limit to billion would restore the capacity of the facility relative to the aggregate size of money fund counterpar ties to roughly the level in place when the facility was established the staff would also monitor money market conditions on an ongoing basis to assess whether any additional adjustments were needed to the on rrp fa cility terms in addition to changes to the on rrp parameters the deputy manager also noted that the federal reserve could consider adjusting its administered rates if undue downward pressure on overnight rates emerged re sponses to the desk surveys indicated that many market participants anticipated adjustments to the interest on excess reserves rate and the on rrp rate at or before the june meeting finally in light of more normal con ditions in agency commercial mortgagebacked securi ties cmbs markets the desk planned to conduct agency cmbs operations as needed to sustain smooth market functioning but would cease regularly scheduled cmbs operations in their discussion following the desk briefings partici pants noted that the on rrp facility had been very ef fective in establishing a firm floor for the federal funds rate and supporting monetary policy implementation participants commented that the facility would continue to be an important part of the monetary policy imple mentation framework going forward particularly in minutes of the meeting of march page coming months with reserve levels projected to rise rap idly participants broadly supported the proposed in crease in the counterparty limit and a few participants also noted that they would support removing the limit altogether a few participants suggested that some type of dynamic or differential limit could be considered in the future to enable the on rrp facility to adapt more readily to market developments a few participants noted that the concerns at the time the facility was es tablished about possible adverse effects of the on rrp facility on financial stability and the structure of money markets had not materialized indeed over the spring of the facility played an important role in helping stabilize money market conditions in light of the po tential for greater use of the on rrp facility going for ward in connection with the expansion of the federal reserves balance sheet and associated downward pres sure on overnight rates a couple of participants noted that it might be useful to review lessons learned regard ing the on rrp facility since its inception following the discussion the chair noted the potential for downward pressure on money market rates and sug gested that should undue downward pressure on over night rates emerge it might be appropriate to implement adjustments to administered rates at upcoming meetings or even between meetings to support effective policy im plementation and ensure that the federal funds rate re mains well within the target range by unanimous vote the committee ratified the desks domestic transactions over the intermeeting period no intervention operations occurred in foreign currencies for the systems account during the intermeeting period staff review of the economic situation the covid pandemic and the measures undertaken to contain its spread continued to affect economic activ ity in the united states and abroad the information available at the time of the march meeting sug gested that us real gross domestic product gdp was expanding in the first quarter of at a pace that was faster than in the fourth quarter of last year although the level of real gdp had likely not yet returned to the level seen before the onset of the pandemic labor market conditions improved in january and february but em ployment was still well below its level at the start of consumer price inflation through januaryas measured by the month percentage change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures pcere mained well below percent total nonfarm payroll employment increased solidly over january and february after softening at the end of last year as of february payroll employment had re traced somewhat more than half of the losses seen since the onset of the pandemic the unemployment rate fell to percent in february the unemployment rates for hispanics and asians declined on balance over january and february while the unemployment rate for african americans was unchanged on net the rates for both af rican americans and hispanics remained well above the national average even though the labor force participa tion rate edged down the employmenttopopulation ra tio moved up somewhat over january and february both measures remained below their prepandemic lev els initial claims for unemployment insurance in early march were at their lowest level since november of last year weekly estimates of privatesector payrolls con structed by federal reserve board staff using data pro vided by the payroll processor adp indicated that the fourweek average increase in private employment at the end of february was about the same as it had been in the middle of the month when the bureau of labor statis tics collects payroll employment data average hourly earnings for all employees rose per cent over the months ending in february and labor compensation per hour in the business sector increased percent over the four quarters of the gains in both these measures however continued to be domi nated by changes in the composition of the workforce in particular the concentration of job losses among lowerwage workers since early last year had resulted in outsized increases in average hourly earnings and com pensation per hour that were not indicative of tight labor market conditions by contrast the employment cost index of total hourly compensation in the private sector rose percent over the months of last year and a staff estimate of the month change in the median wage derived from the adp data was percent in jan uary these measures are likely to have been less af fected by changes in workforce composition and they were rising more slowly than their prepandemic pace total pce price inflation was percent over the months ending in january and continued to be held down by slack in resource utilization core pce price inflation which excludes changes in consumer energy prices and many consumer food prices also was per cent over the months ending in january while the trimmed mean measure of month pce inflation con structed by the federal reserve bank of dallas was percent in january in february the month change in the consumer price index cpi was per cent while core cpi inflation was percent over the same period the latest readings on surveybased page federal open market committee measures of longerrun inflation expectations were little changed on balance in early march the university of michigan surveys of consumers preliminary measure for the next to years was the same as in the previous two months while in february the yearahead meas ure of inflation expectations produced by the federal reserve bank of new york was essentially unchanged from its january level the survey of professional fore casters measure of pce price inflation over the next years edged up in the first quarter returning to its pre pandemic level a staff index of common inflation ex pectations which summarizes the comovement of a wide variety of inflation expectations measures was at about the same level in the fourth quarter of last year as in the third quarter consumer spending appeared to be increasing in the first quarter at a pace considerably faster on balance than in the fourth quarter of last year real pce ex panded strongly in january after declining over the pre ceding two months with spending likely boosted by fed eral stimulus payments sent out in early january the components of the nominal retail sales data used by the bureau of economic analysis to estimate pce pointed to a stepdown in spending in february but revised data for the previous month suggested an even stronger gain in january spending in march was expected to be boosted by additional federal stimulus payments from the arp which started to be distributed around the mid dle of the month in addition the personal saving rate jumped to an even higher level in january and ongoing gains in labor earnings along with further fiscal support pointed to additional increases in accumulated house hold savings moreover the preliminary reading of con sumer sentiment from the michigan survey moved up notably in early march to its highest level over the past year reportedly reflecting the growing number of vac cinations and the enactment of the arp although con sumer sentiment remained below its levels from just be fore the onset of the pandemic construction of singlefamily homes and home sales re mained well above their prepandemic levels however the incoming data for this sector were mixed starts of singlefamily homes moved down notably over january and february in part likely reflecting severe winter weather in february starts of multifamily units also fell in february but by less than the strong increase seen in january construction permits for singlefamily homes moved down on net over january and february point ing to some slowing in construction in coming months sales of both new and existing homes increased further in january and home prices continued to rise briskly business investment in equipment and intangibles was continuing to increase in the first quarter after rising ap preciably in the fourth quarter of last year nominal shipments of nondefense capital goods excluding air craft expanded strongly in january and rising orders for these goods pointed to further gains in business equip ment spending in coming months business investment in the drilling and mining sector appeared to be increas ing further after turning up sharply in the fourth quarter as crude oil and natural gas rigs in operationan indica tor of drilling investmentcontinued to rise through early march with oil prices moving higher nominal nonresidential construction spending rose somewhat in january but investment in nonresidential structures out side of the drilling and mining sector looked to remain weak in the current quarter after declining further in the fourth quarter reflecting continued hesitation by busi nesses to commit to building projects with lengthy times to completion and uncertain future returns industrial production continued to rise solidly in january but then fell markedly in february largely reflecting de clines in manufacturing and mining sector output caused by severe winter weather in the south central region of the country in the middle of that month along with the severe weather a cutback in the production of motor vehicles and parts also reflected a global shortage of semiconductors new orders indexes in national and re gional manufacturing surveys pointed toward solid in creases in factory output in the coming months al though reports of shortages in materials and labor as well as bottlenecks in transportation signaled some po tential restraints on the pace of the manufacturing recov ery total real government purchases appeared to be rising in the first quarter after edging down in the fourth quar ter although data through february indicated that de fense spending was moving down a likely bounceback in nondefense spending was expected to lift total federal purchases state and local government purchases looked to be increasing as the payrolls of these governments expanded on net over january and february and nom inal state and local construction spending increased sol idly in january moreover additional federal support for state and local governments included in the arp along with an improved outlook for state and local tax reve nues pointed to further notable increases in state and local purchases data for december and january showed a narrower nominal us international trade deficit than in novem ber both imports and exports continued to rebound minutes of the meeting of march page from their collapse in the first half of last year goods imports in january were much higher than a year earlier with continued gains in most categories nominal goods exports in january nearly recovered to their level from a year earlier with particular strength in exports of capital goods and industrial supplies services imports and ex ports remained depressed weighed down by the contin ued suspension of most international travel recent data pointed to a slowdown in economic activity across foreign economies around the turn of the year as tight socialdistancing restrictions were imposed to rein in a new wave of covid infections in various parts of the world most notably in europe and latin america even so economies appeared to be better adapted to operating under restrictions than during previous waves of infections manufacturing activity continued to gen erally outperform activity in the services sector and manufactured exports from china and some other asian economies remained strong especially to the united states inflation rebounded in many foreign economies reflecting rising energy prices and other temporary fac tors however underlying inflationary pressures re mained subdued staff review of the financial situation investors appeared to have become more optimistic about the economic outlook over the intermeeting pe riod against the backdrop of progress on covid vaccinations signs of stronger domestic spending and additional fiscal stimulus the nominal treasury yield curve steepened markedly largely because of increases in longerterm real yields although measures of inflation compensation also increased further despite the spikes in equity market volatility early in the intermeeting pe riod spurred by heavy trading concentrated in a few spe cific stocks and subsequent concerns over the rapid rise in longerterm interest rates broad equity price indexes rose on net consistent with the stronger outlook spreads on highyield corporate bonds narrowed fi nancing conditions for businesses with access to capital markets and households with high credit scores re mained broadly accommodative but conditions stayed tight for other borrowers the treasury yield curve steepened over the intermeet ing period with and year yields rising markedly measures of inflation compensation increased moder ately on net continuing the trend observed over recent months however in contrast to recent months most of the recent increase in longerterm treasury yields was accounted for by higher tipsimplied real yields mar ket participants attributed the increases in longerterm yields in part to increased investor optimism about the economic outlook and expectations of higher treasury debt issuance on february yields rose especially sharply market depth became thin and bidask spreads widened but treasury market liquidity gradually recov ered over the following days swaptionimplied volatili ties of longerterm interest rates rose notably the expected path for the federal funds rate over the next few years as implied by a straight read of overnight index swap quotes rose substantially since the previous fomc meeting and moved above basis points in the first

going forward the broad dollar index rose modestly with more notable appreciation against currencies of emerging market economies emes eme sovereign spreads edged up and flows into eme bond funds fell back later in the period amid the rise in yields in ad vanced economies however flows into dedicated eme equity funds remained strong overall foreign eq uity indexes increased slightly in most major markets financing conditions for nonfinancial businesses in cap ital markets remained broadly accommodative over the intermeeting period supported by low interest rates and high equity valuations gross and net corporate bond issuances were solid in january and february gross is suance of leveraged loans was strong in january driven mainly by refinancing activity as primarymarket spreads compressed notably since the end of last year in re sponse to strong investor demand for such loans eq uity raised through traditional initial public offerings and seasoned equity offerings continued to be strong in jan uary and february and initial equity offerings by special purpose acquisition companies remained exceptionally high commercial and industrial loans outstanding on banks balance

accommodative for borrowers with strong credit scores but were still tight for those with nonprime scores auto loan balances continued to grow in january while credit card balances declined interest rates on new credit card offers to borrowers with prime credit scores continued to trend down on net through december in contrast offer rates to nonprime borrow ers rose further conditions in the assetbacked securi ties market were stable during the intermeeting period staff economic outlook the us economic projection prepared by the staff for the march fomc meeting was considerably stronger than the january forecast real gdp growth appeared to be picking up at the beginning of this year by more than the staff had expected likely reflecting both a fasterthananticipated easing in social distancing and a more rapid response by households to the fiscal support package enacted in late december moreover the size of the arp enacted in march was considerably larger than what the staff had assumed in the january projec tion all told real gdp growth was projected to be sub stantial this year and the unemployment rate was fore cast to decline markedly as the staffs projection also continued to anticipate that widespread vaccination would allow for further easing in social distancing this year real gdp growth was expected to step down in and but still outpace that of potential over this period leading to a decline in the unemployment rate to historically low levels as monetary policy was as sumed to remain highly accommodative minutes of the meeting of march page incoming data on inflation were a little above what the staff had expected the month changes in total and core pce prices were expected to transitorily move above percent in coming months as the low inflation readings from the spring of last year dropped out of the calculation window in addition inflation was forecast to be temporarily boosted this year by the expected emergence of some production bottlenecks and supply constraints following the transitory increase this year inflation was projected to run a bit below percent next year and then to reach percent by reflecting tight resource utilization in product and labor markets the staff continued to see the uncertainty surrounding the outlook as elevated moreover the uncertain course of the pandemic particularly the emergence of more contagious strains of the coronavirus in the united states and elsewhere was still viewed as tilting the risks to the economic outlook to the downside however given the resilience of the economy in the face of the earlier surge in new covid cases hospitalizations and deaths and the magnitude of fiscal support enacted the downside risks to the economic outlook were seen as smaller than for the previous projection the staff viewed the risks of upside inflationary pressures as hav ing increased since the previous forecast and now saw the risks to the inflation projection as balanced participants views on current conditions and the economic outlook in conjunction with this fomc meeting participants submitted their projections of the most likely outcomes for real gdp growth the unemployment rate and infla tion for each year from through and over the longer run based on their individual assessments of ap propriate monetary policy including the path of the fed eral funds rate the longerrun projections represented each participants assessment of the rate to which each variable would be expected to converge over time un der appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy a summary of eco nomic projections was released to the public following the conclusion of the meeting in their discussion of current conditions participants noted that the covid pandemic was causing tre mendous human and economic hardship across the united states and around the world following a mod eration in the pace of the recovery indicators of eco nomic activity and employment had turned up recently although the sectors most adversely affected by the pan demic remained weak inflation continued to run below percent overall financial conditions remained accom modative in part reflecting policy measures to support the economy and the flow of credit to us households and businesses participants noted that the path of the economy would depend significantly on the course of the virus including progress on vaccinations and that the ongoing public health crisis would continue to weigh on economic activity employment and inflation and posed considerable risks to the economic outlook participants observed that the pace of the economic re covery had picked up recently and that the economy continued to show resilience in the face of the pandemic they noted encouraging developments regarding the pandemic including significant declines in the number of new cases hospitalizations and deaths over the inter meeting period as well as a pickup in the pace of vac cinations in light of these developments as well as the extent of the recent fiscal policy support participants significantly revised up their projections for real gdp growth this year compared with the projections they submitted last december they noted however that economic activity and employment were currently well below levels consistent with maximum employment participants observed that the economic downturn had not fallen equally on all americans and that lower income and black and hispanic households had been disproportionately affected by the pandemic a number of participants stressed that recently enacted fiscal sup port would help address some of the hardships faced by these groups and that monetary policy would also help by promoting the economys return to the committees goals of broadbased and inclusive maximum employ ment and price stability participants observed that household spending had risen notably so far this year and anticipated that further gains in consumer spending would contribute significantly to the economic recovery while household spending on services that typically require close personal contact re mained weak participants expected spending on these services would improve as vaccinations became more widespread socialdistancing measures were relaxed and the public became less wary of close personal inter actions participants anticipated consumer spending would be bolstered by the recently enacted fiscal stimu lus packages as well as by accommodative monetary pol icy many participants also pointed to the elevated level of household savings and judged that the release of pent up demand could boost consumption growth further as social distancing waned participants also observed that residential construction continued to be solid and home page federal open market committee sales remained robust in part because of low interest rates low inventory was viewed as an important factor supporting strong gains in housing prices with respect to the business sector participants ob served that business equipment investment had contin ued to increase and that readings on new orders and shipments of capital goods remained strong while some district contacts continued to report that firms in industries such as cre or leisure travel and hospitality were struggling from pandemicrelated social distancing other district contacts reported that activity in these in dustries had started to improve participants noted that surveys of business activity had picked up recently and that many district contacts were growing increasingly optimistic about business prospects given ongoing pro gress on vaccinations participants also discussed re ports of shortages in materials key intermediate inputs and labor as well as bottlenecks in shipping a few par ticipants noted that higher crop prices were continuing to boost income in the agricultural sector several par ticipants judged that the support provided by the arp could improve the financial positions of small firms that had been adversely affected by the pandemic participants observed that labor market conditions had improved recently as payroll employment registered strong gains in february and the unemployment rate fell to percent even so payroll employment was about million jobs below its prepandemic level and labor market conditions for those in the most disadvantaged communities were viewed as lagging behind those of other households moreover participants noted that employment in the leisure and hospitality sector was still down substantially from its prepandemic level despite a sharp rebound in february participants generally ex pected strong job gains to continue over coming months and into the medium term supported by accommoda tive fiscal and monetary policies as well as by continued progress on vaccinations further reopening of sectors most affected by the pandemic and the associated re covery in economic activity however participants noted that the economy was far from achieving the committees broadbased and inclusive goal of maxi mum employment some participants commented that labor force participation continued to be held down by workers health concerns and additional childcare re sponsibilities associated with virtual schooling and that the pace of recovery in the labor market would depend importantly on how rapidly those affected by these is sues could rejoin the labor force several participants noted that the speed of the labor market recovery also depended on factors such as the movement of workers across industries and occupations in a restructuring economy or the effects of technological change on the demand for labor several participants suggested that the arp could hasten the recovery which could help limit longerterm damage in labor markets caused by the pandemic participants observed that headline pce inflation con tinued to run below percent in the near term the month change in pce prices was expected to move above percent as the low inflation readings from the spring of last year drop out of the calculation most par ticipants also pointed to supply constraints that could contribute to price increases for some goods in coming months as the economy continued to reopen after the transitory effects of these factors fade however partici pants generally anticipated that annual inflation readings would edge down next year subsequently participants expected that inflation would likely move along a trajec tory consistent with achieving the committees objec tives over time supported by strong aggregate demand which participants expected would be driven in part by accommodative monetary and fiscal policies participants discussed market and surveybased measures of longerterm inflation expectations and their implications for the inflation outlook marketbased measures of inflation compensation at the and year horizons had continued to move up over the intermeet ing period while surveybased measures of inflation ex pectations were little changed on balance a number of participants indicated that the increases in marketbased measures of inflation compensation from the very low levels of last spring were consistent with the view that inflation was likely to move along a path over time con sistent with the committees goals participants noted that overall financial conditions re mained highly accommodative in part reflecting the stance of monetary policy participants commented on the notable rise in longerterm treasury yields that oc curred over the intermeeting period and generally viewed it as reflecting the improved economic outlook some firming in inflation expectations and expectations for increased treasury debt issuance disorderly condi tions in treasury markets or a persistent rise in yields that could jeopardize progress toward the committees goals were seen as cause for concern while overall fi nancial conditions were still seen as accommodative a number of participants remarked that financing condi tions remained challenging for many small businesses a minutes of the meeting of march page couple of participants expressed concern that highly ac commodative financial conditions could lead to exces sive risktaking and the buildup of financial imbalances while generally acknowledging that the mediumterm outlook for real gdp growth and employment had im proved participants continued to see the uncertainty surrounding that outlook as elevated participants agreed that the path of the economy would depend sig nificantly on the course of the virus including progress on vaccinations most participants indicated that the pandemic continued to pose considerable risks to the economic outlook including risks associated with new morecontagious virus strains obstacles in getting suffi cient numbers of the public vaccinated or social distancing fatigue a few participants pointed to risks associated with stress in the cre sector or to risks asso ciated with the unwinding of mortgage forbearance and eviction moratoriums provided to households with re gard to upside risks some participants pointed to the possibility that fiscal policy could have a more expan sionary effect than anticipated that households could display a greaterthanexpected willingness to spend out of accumulated savings or that widespread vaccinations and easing of social distancing could result in a more rapid boost to spending and employment than antici pated most participants noted that they viewed the risks to the outlook for inflation as broadly balanced several re marked that supply disruptions and strong demand could push up price inflation more than anticipated several participants commented that the factors that had contributed to low inflation during the previous expan sion could again exert more downward pressure on in flation than expected in their consideration of the stance of monetary policy participants reaffirmed the federal reserves commit ment to using its full range of tools to support the us economy during this challenging time thereby promot ing the committees statutory goals of maximum em ployment and price stability participants noted that in dicators of economic activity and employment had turned up recently after a period of moderation al though the sectors most adversely affected by the pan demic remained weak despite these positive indicators and an improved public health situation participants agreed that the economy remained far from the com mittees longerrun goals and that the path ahead re mained highly uncertain with the pandemic continuing to pose considerable risks to the outlook consequently participants judged that the current stance of policy and policy guidance remained appropriate to foster further economic recovery as well as to achieve inflation that av erages percent over time and longerterm inflation ex pectations that remain well anchored at percent participants judged that the committees current guid ance for the federal funds rate and asset purchases was serving the economy well they noted that a benefit of the outcomebased guidance was that it did not need to be recalibrated often in response to incoming data or the evolving outlook participants also noted the im portance of communicating to the public that the exist ing guidance together with the new monetary policy framework as delineated in the revised statement on longerrun goals and monetary policy strategy meant that the path of the federal funds rate and the balance sheet depend on actual progress toward reaching the committees maximumemployment and inflation goals in particular various participants noted that changes in the path of policy should be based primarily on observed outcomes rather than forecasts participants agreed that overall financial conditions were accommodative they noted that the federal reserves asset purchases since last march had materially eased fi nancial conditions and were providing substantial sup port to the economy participants noted that it would likely be some time until substantial further progress to ward the committees maximumemployment and pricestability goals would be realized and that con sistent with the committees outcomebased guidance asset purchases would continue at least at the current pace until then a number of participants highlighted the importance of the committee clearly communicating its assessment of progress toward its longerrun goals well in advance of the time when it could be judged sub stantial enough to warrant a change in the pace of asset purchases the timing of such communications would depend on the evolution of the economy and the pace of progress toward the committees goals committee policy action in their discussion of monetary policy for this meeting members agreed that the covid pandemic was causing tremendous human and economic hardship across the united states and around the world they noted that following a moderation in the pace of the re covery indicators of economic activity and employment had turned up recently although the sectors most ad versely affected by the pandemic remained weak infla tion continued to run below percent overall financial conditions remained accommodative in part reflecting policy measures to support the economy and the flow of page federal open market committee credit to us households and businesses members also remarked that the path of the economy would depend significantly on the course of the virus including pro gress on vaccinations in addition members agreed that the ongoing public health crisis continued to weigh on economic activity employment and inflation and was posing considerable risks to the economic outlook members agreed that the federal reserve was commit ted to using its full range of tools to support the us economy in this challenging time thereby promoting its maximumemployment and pricestability goals all members reaffirmed that in accordance with the com mittees goals to achieve maximum employment and in flation at the rate of percent over the longer run and with inflation running persistently below this longerrun goal they would aim to achieve inflation moderately above percent for some time so that inflation averages percent over time and longerterm inflation expecta tions remain well anchored at percent members ex pected to maintain an accommodative stance of mone tary policy until those outcomes were achieved all members agreed to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at to percent and they expected that it would be appropriate to maintain this target range until labor market conditions had reached levels con sistent with the committees assessments of maximum employment and inflation had risen to percent and was on track to moderately exceed percent for some time in addition members agreed that it would be appropri ate for the federal reserve to continue to increase its holdings of treasury securities by at least billion per month and agency mortgagebacked securities by at least billion per month until substantial further progress had been made toward the committees maximum employment and pricestability goals they judged that these asset purchases would help foster smooth market functioning and accommodative financial conditions thereby supporting the flow of credit to households and businesses members agreed that in assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy they would continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook and that they would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate in the event that risks emerged that could impede the attainment of the committees goals members also agreed that in as sessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy they would take into account a wide range of information in cluding readings on public health labor market condi tions inflation pressures and inflation expectations and financial and international developments with regard to the postmeeting statement in light of the notably positive tone of recent data members judged that it was appropriate to incorporate that development in the description of the economic situation with the lan guage that indicators of economic activity and employ ment have turned up recently members also deter mined that with oil prices having essentially retraced their pandemicrelated declines it was appropriate to re move the reference to oil prices as a factor holding down consumer price inflation and to simply state that infla tion continues to run below percent regarding the directive to the desk members agreed that the directive should incorporate the proposed increase in the per counterparty limit for the on rrp facility to billion at the conclusion of the discussion the committee voted to authorize and direct the federal reserve bank of new york until instructed otherwise to execute transactions in the system open market account in ac cordance with the following domestic policy directive for release at pm effective

households and businesses the path of the economy will depend signifi cantly on the course of the virus including pro gress on vaccinations the ongoing public health crisis continues to weigh on economic activity employment and inflation and poses considerable risks to the economic outlook the committee seeks to achieve maximum em ployment and inflation at the rate of percent over the longer run with inflation running per sistently below this longerrun goal the com mittee will aim to achieve inflation moderately above percent for some time so that inflation averages percent over time and longerterm inflation expectations remain well anchored at percent the committee expects to maintain an accommodative stance of monetary policy until these outcomes are achieved the com mittee decided to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at to percent and expects it will be appropriate to maintain this target range until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the committees assessments of maximum employment and in flation has risen to percent and is on track to moderately exceed percent for some time in addition the federal reserve will continue to increase its holdings of treasury securities by at least billion per month and of agency mortgagebacked securities by at least bil lion per month until substantial further progress has been made toward the committees maxi mum employment and price stability goals these asset purchases help foster smooth mar ket functioning and accommodative financial conditions thereby supporting the flow of credit to households and businesses in assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy the committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook the committee would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the committees goals the committees assessments will take into account a wide range of information in cluding readings on public health labor market conditions inflation pressures and inflation ex pectations and financial and international de velopments voting for this

system open market account soma manager first discussed developments in financial markets over the intermeeting period financial conditions eased modestly as market participants continued to focus on progress toward economic reopening as well as support ive monetary and fiscal policy equity prices rose with the sp index reaching a record high while treas ury yields the dollar and credit spreads declined mod estly the equity gains were broad based across sectors though shares of small caps as captured by the russell index declined news regarding losses associated with a highly levered family investment office affected the equity prices of some large financial firms but the broader financial market effects appeared limited after rising sharply in recent months longerterm treas ury yields declined modestly over the intermeeting pe riod even as market expectations for us growth con tinued to be revised higher contacts reported that the earlier increases in yields drew in a range of investors including foreign institutions pension funds and insur ance companies against this backdrop term premiums as measured by term structure models and based on es page federal open market committee timates using the open market desks surveys of pri mary dealers and market participants moved slightly lower nonetheless market participants were attentive to the potential for rising yields going forward and in recent months desk survey respondents had increased the probability they attach to higher yields at the end of regarding expectations for the policy outlook the mar ket and surveyimplied paths of the federal funds rate were both relatively little changed over the intermeeting period and the modal survey path in later years contin ued to imply that the target range would gradually in crease to a level just over percent in expecta tions for the path of asset purchases were also stable and market participants remained focused on the commit tees communications about progress toward its goals according to the median survey responses the federal reserves net purchases of treasury and agency securi ties were expected to end three quarters after the first reduction in the pace of asset purchases and the first increase in the target range for the federal funds rate was expected to occur three quarters after that recent financial market developments across advanced economies reflected differing expectations for economic growth and monetary policy some countries that were expected to recoup covidrelated output losses earlier than others had seen larger yield increases and more appreciation in their currencies in recent months over the intermeeting period the bank of canada an nounced a reduction in the pace of its asset purchases and brought forward its forecast of when conditions would be met for an increase in its policy rate the manager turned next to money markets and the federal reserves balance sheet reserve balances in creased further this intermeeting period to a record level of trillion the effective federal funds rate was steady at basis points however amid ongoing strong demand for safe shortterm investments and reduced treasury bill supply the secured overnight financing rate sofr stood at basis point throughout the pe riod the overnight reverse repurchase agreement on rrp facility continued to effectively support pol icy implementation and takeup peaked at more than billion a modest amount of trading in overnight repurchase agreement repo markets occurred at nega tive rates although this development appeared to largely reflect technical factors the soma manager noted that downward pressure on overnight rates in coming months could result in conditions that warrant consider ation of a modest adjustment to administered rates and could ultimately lead to a greater share of federal re serve balance sheet expansion being channeled into on rrp and other federal reserve liabilities although few survey respondents expected an adjustment to ad ministered rates at the current meeting more than half expected an adjustment by the end of the june fomc meeting the manager concluded with an update on three opera tional issues following the review of the on rrp fa cility discussed at the previous meeting the desk planned to relax counterparty eligibility criteria for money funds and governmentsponsored enterprises in order to allow smaller counterparties of these types to participate the desk also planned to make modest ad justments to the allocation of treasury outright pur chases across maturity ranges to ensure that purchases remain roughly proportional to the outstanding amounts of treasury securities these minor technical adjust ments would have no implications for the effects of the federal reserves asset purchases on overall financial conditions finally the manager requested that the committee vote to maintain the standing us dollar and foreign currency liquidity swap arrangements and to re new the reciprocal currency arrangements with canada and mexico under the north american framework agreement the committee voted unanimously to renew the recip rocal currency arrangements with the bank of canada and the bank of mexico these arrangements are associ ated with the federal reserves participation in the north american framework agreement of in ad dition the committee voted unanimously to renew the dollar and foreign currency liquidity swap arrangements with the bank of canada the bank of england the bank of japan the european central bank and the swiss na tional bank the votes to renew the federal reserves participation in these standing arrangements occur an nually at the april or may fomc meeting by unanimous vote the committee ratified the desks domestic transactions over the intermeeting period there were no intervention operations in foreign curren cies for the systems account during the intermeeting pe riod discussion of repurchase agreement arrange ments the staff briefed participants on the federal reserves experience with the daily repo operations with primary dealers that have been in place since september and the temporary foreign and international monetary authorities fima repo facility established in march minutes of the meeting of april page last year the briefing also reviewed considerations that could be relevant for policymakers judgments regarding whether these arrangements should become permanent standing facilities the staff noted that repo operations have been a useful tool in controlling the federal funds rate by adding reserves to ensure that they remain ample and by limiting pressures in repo markets that could spill over into unsecured markets in march repo op erations worked in concert with other measures to man age shocks to financial markets by stabilizing treasury market conditions since june when the rate on overnight repo operations was raised relative to the rate of interest on excess reserves repo operations have served as a backstop and there has been no substantive usage regarding considerations concerning a perma nent standing repo facility the briefing noted that stand ing repo operations could be viewed as useful in fore stalling funding strains that could spill over into other overnight markets and limit dealers intermediation ac tivity in financial markets however a standing repo fa cility could be seen as a form of liquidity support for nonbank financial institutions and one that could create incentives for firms with access to the facility to take on more liquidity risk against eligible securities than would otherwise be the case in discussing considerations for the establishment of a standing fima repo facility the staff noted that such a facility could limit the propensity for foreign official institutions to execute large sales of us treasury securities in a stress environment that in turn could exacerbate strains in broader us domestic financial markets the briefing also noted some poten tial drawbacks of such a facility including less transpar ency regarding its operations relative to other federal reserve facilities in their discussion of considerations related to the estab lishment of a standing repo facility as part of the com mittees overall approach to policy implementations in an ample reserves regime a substantial majority of par ticipants saw the potential benefits of an appropriately calibrated facility as outweighing the potential costs nearly all participants commented that a standing repo facility by acting as a backstop could help address pres sures in the markets for us treasury securities and treasury repo that could spill over to other funding mar kets and impair the implementation and transmission of monetary policy in this regard a number of participants noted the potential for pressures in shortterm funding markets to arise from time to time even with monetary policy operating in an amplereserves regime many par ticipants noted that a standing facility could provide a timely and automatic response to incipient market pres sures they remarked that such pressures can be difficult to anticipate and as a result might not be as promptly addressed with discretionary operations a few partici pants noted that a standing repo facility could provide counterparties with additional flexibility in managing the composition of their holdings of highquality liquid as sets potentially reducing the demand for reserves a few participants cautioned that establishing a standing repo facility should not be viewed as a way of imple menting monetary policy without an ample supply of re serves a couple of participants remarked that most of the benefits of a standing repo facility could be realized by the federal reserve maintaining readiness to conduct repo operations on short notice as needed noting that such an arrangement could avoid some of the costs of a standing facility a few participants mentioned that a standing repo facility could be perceived as a means of supporting the financing of the us treasury or as a per manent federal reserve liquidity backstop for nonde pository institutions a couple of others called out the risk that such a facility could crowd out private market sources of liquidity provision participants noted that it would be important to carefully consider key design elements of a potential standing repo facility including the pricing structure counterpar ties and range of collateral accepted a number of par ticipants commented that the counterparties at such a fa cility should include depository institutions several par ticipants noted the facilitys design should be targeted specifically to enhance control of the federal funds rate rather than to limit volatility in the repo market in their discussion of considerations related to the estab lishment of a permanent fima repo facility a vast ma jority of participants saw the potential benefits as out weighing the costs participants highlighted a number of benefits of a standing fima repo facility with many noting that it could support smoother functioning in us treasury securities markets and us financial mar kets more broadly by providing foreign official holders of us treasury securities with an alternative to outright sales of these securities in times of market stress a few participants noted that had a fima repo facility been in place in march it likely would have significantly damped pressures in these markets caused by the abrupt need for dollar funding abroad several participants sug gested that a standing fima repo facility could be viewed as complementing the existing dollar swap lines by extending access to dollar funding for a broader range of central banks and foreign official institutions partic ipants also commented on some potential risks of a page federal open market committee standing fima repo facility including less transparency in connection with fima repo operations relative to other federal reserve facilities staff review of the economic situation the covid pandemic and the measures undertaken to contain its spread continued to affect economic activ ity in the united states and abroad the information available at the time of the april meeting sug gested that us real gross domestic product gdp had increased in the first quarter of at a pace that was faster than in the fourth quarter of last year but had not yet returned to its prepandemic level labor market conditions improved markedly in march though em ployment remained well below its level at the start of consumer price inflation through februaryas measured by the month percentage change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures pcecontinued to run well below percent total nonfarm payroll employment surged in march with a notable gain in the leisure and hospitality sector as of march payroll employment had retraced almost twothirds of the losses seen at the onset of the pan demic the unemployment rate declined to percent in march as the number of workers on temporary layoff continued to fall and the number on permanent layoff ticked down although the unemployment rates for af rican americans and hispanics fell both rates remained well above the national average in addition the asian unemployment rate moved up and was equal to the na tional average in march the labor force participation rate and employmenttopopulation ratio increased in march though both measures remained below their pre pandemic levels initial claims for unemployment insur ance had moved down on net since midmarch and were at the lowest level since the beginning of the pan demic though they remained exceptionally high by pre pandemic standards weekly estimates of privatesector payrolls constructed by federal reserve board staff us ing data provided by the payroll processor adp which were available through the first half of april suggested that the rate of increase in private employment had slowed somewhat relative to its earlier robust pace average hourly earnings for all employees rose per cent over the months ending in march the month change in average hourly earnings continued to be influenced by the effect of the pandemic on the composition of the workforce in particular the concen tration of job losses among lowerwage workers since early last year had resulted in large increases in this meas ure that were not indicative of tight labor market condi tions by contrast a staff measure of the month change in the median wage derived from the adp data was percent in march and continued to run below its prepandemic pace this measure had likely been less af fected by shifts in the composition of the workforce total pce price inflation was percent over the months ending in february and continued to be held down by low rates of resource utilization core pce price inflation which excludes changes in consumer en ergy prices and many consumer food prices was per cent over the months ending in february while the trimmed mean measure of month pce inflation con structed by the federal reserve bank of dallas was percent in february in march the month change in the consumer price index cpi was percent boosted by increases in consumer energy prices while core cpi inflation was percent over the same period in the first quarter of the staffs common inflation expectations index which combines information from many indicators of inflation expectations and inflation compensation had returned to the level that prevailed in real pce declined in february however available indi catorsincluding the components of the nominal retail sales data used to estimate pcepointed to a large in crease in march and for the first quarter as a whole with federal stimulus payments having likely supported the march increase housing starts bounced back in march following a weatherinduced decline in february al though existing home sales fell in february and march the declines appeared to reflect continued limited avail ability of homes for sale rather than weakening demand in addition februarys drop in new home sales was re traced in march available indicators suggested that equipment and intan gibles investment had increased in the first quarter of though at a slower pace than that seen in the fourth quarter of likewise drilling investment ap peared to have moved up boosted in part by higher en ergy prices however investment in nonresidential structures outside of the drilling and mining sector looked as though it had declined further in the first quar ter likely reflecting ongoing uncertainty about the longerterm effects of the pandemic on businesses manufacturing output rebounded strongly in march fol lowing weatherrelated disruptions to production in february the march rise in factory output occurred de spite lingering supply constraints for example weather minutes of the meeting of april page damaged facilities in texas used to produce petrochem ical and plastic materials had not yet been fully repaired and semiconductor shortages were still weighing on mo tor vehicle production total real government purchases appeared to have moved up in the first quarter after having declined over the second half of available data suggested that a jump in federal nondefense purchases had offset a de cline in defense purchases in addition indicators of real state and local purchases pointed to a small firstquarter increase data for february showed a wider nominal us interna tional trade deficit than in january both imports and exports fell from their january levels the first nominal decline in each since last may goods imports were held back in february by weakness in imports for automotive products and consumer goods but remained higher than their prepandemic level nominal goods exports in february were weak in most categories and were still be low their prepandemic level imports and exports of services remained depressed weighed down by the con tinued suspension of most international travel incoming data were consistent with a sharp slowdown in foreign economic growth in the first quarter follow ing a tightening of socialdistancing restrictions to con tain new waves of covid infections nevertheless the slowdown appeared less severe than observed de clines in mobility would have suggested underscoring that foreign economies continued to adapt to public health restrictions the most recent indicators showed that economic activity in many advanced foreign econo mies afes resumed expanding toward the end of the first quarter amid a partial easing of restrictions how ever a new surge in infections in several countries in latin america and south asia notably india under scored the fragility of the global recovery foreign head line inflation rose considerably boosted by temporary factors such as the fading effects of steep price declines seen early last year and the passthrough of price in creases for oil and other commodities however under lying inflationary pressures

municipal bond market re mained accommodative over the intermeeting period issuance of municipal bonds was strong in march and indicators of the credit quality of municipal debt were little changed in february and march financing condi tions for small businesses appeared to have improved with demand for loans remaining subdued likely in part because of the paycheck protection program small business loan originations rose notably in february the most recent month for which data were available and were close to prepandemic levels however even amid improving financing conditions many small

first quarter of but were generally still tighter than before the pan demic interest rates offered to nonprime borrowers continued to rise through february with the fraction of these offers with zero introductory rates continuing to decline the staff provided an update on its assessments of the stability of the financial system the staff noted that cor porate bond spreads had declined notably since late last year and were at the lower ends of their historical distri butions in addition measures of the equity risk pre mium declined further and nonprice measures such as high ipo volume also indicated elevated investor appe tite for risk in the equity market valuation pressures for cre remained high although information related to cre continued to be noisier than usual due to pan

continued minutes of the meeting of april page government support a slower pace of business borrow ing and improving business earnings although many households and businesses continued to struggle re garding financial leverage the staff noted that bank cap ital ratios remained above prepandemic levels in the fourth quarter but risks remained leverage among hedge funds was elevated and increased in the third quarter of last year for the most highly leveraged funds leverage in hedge funds prime brokerage accounts rose notably through the fourth quarter of last year reflecting elevated hedge fund leverage related to their stock mar ket activities the staff highlighted recent episodes un derlining the opacity of risk exposures among some lev eraged entities with regard to funding risks the staff noted that mmfs and openend mutual funds faced sig nificant structural vulnerabilities associated with liquidity transformation assets under management at mmfs de clined during the second half of while openend mutual fund holdings of corporate bonds rose during the second half of last year staff economic outlook the us economic projection prepared by the staff for the april fomc meeting was slightly stronger than the march forecast real gdp growth was projected to post a substantial increase this year with a correspondingly rapid decline in the unemployment rate as further re ductions in social distancing and favorable financial con ditions were expected to support output growth with the boost to growth from continued reductions in social distancing assumed to fade after gdp growth was expected to step down in and however with monetary policy assumed to remain highly accommoda tive the staff continued to anticipate that real gdp growth would outpace that of potential over much of this period leading to a decline in the unemployment rate to historically low levels the staffs outlook for inflation was broadly unchanged the month changes in total and core pce prices were expected to move above percent in coming months as the unusually low readings from the spring of dropped out of the calculation window and as a recent jump in consumer energy prices pushed up the total measure core inflation was expected to ease some later in the year but to remain above percent at the end of boosted by large increases in import prices a recovery in prices that had been especially affected by the pandemic and the temporary effects of supply bot tlenecks inflation was then projected to dip slightly be low percent in as the influence of these transitory factors diminished before returning to percent by the end of supported by sustained tight levels of re source utilization in labor and product markets the staff continued to judge that the risks to the baseline projection for economic activity were skewed to the downside and that the uncertainty around the forecast was elevated in particular despite the demonstrated re silience of the economy to surges in the pandemic over the past year the possibility that covid variants that were more contagious or more resistant to existing vaccines would spread posed a salient downside risk the staff continued to view the risks around the inflation projection as balanced on the upside bottlenecks sup ply disruptions and historically high rates of resource utilization were seen as potential sources of greaterthan expected inflationary pressures alternatively the possi bility that inflation would be held down by low underly ing trend inflation and a weakerthanexpected response to resource utilization was seen as an important down side risk participants views on current conditions and the economic outlook in their discussion of current conditions participants noted that the covid pandemic was causing tre mendous human and economic hardship across the united states and around the world amid progress on vaccinations and strong policy support indicators of economic activity and employment had strengthened the sectors most adversely affected by the pandemic re mained weak but had shown improvement inflation had risen largely reflecting transitory factors overall financial conditions remained accommodative in part reflecting policy measures to support the economy and the flow of credit to us households and businesses participants noted that the path of the economy would depend significantly on the course of the virus including progress on vaccinations the ongoing public health cri sis continued to weigh on the economy and risks to the economic outlook remained participants observed that economic activity had picked up sharply this year with robust gains in consumer spending housingsector activity business equipment investment and manufacturing production they noted that the acceleration in economic activity reflected posi tive developments associated with the rapid pace of vac cinations as well as continued support from fiscal and monetary policies nevertheless participants generally noted that the economy remained far from the commit tees maximumemployment and pricestability goals in their discussion of the household sector participants remarked that indicators of consumer spending surged page federal open market committee in march and expected that further gains in spending would contribute significantly to the economic recovery many participants commented that fiscal stimulus ac commodative financial conditions the release of pent up demand progress on widespread vaccination and the ongoing reduction of socialdistancing measures were important factors supporting spending many partici pants also noted that consumer spending would con tinue to be bolstered by these factors as well as by the elevated level of accumulated household savings sev eral participants observed that housing market activity continued to be strong supported in part by low interest rates with respect to the business sector participants noted that business equipment investment continued to rise at a robust pace and manufacturing activity was expanding at a strong clip that said many participants discussed reports of shortages of materials and labor as well as sup ply chain bottlenecks as likely restraints to the pace of recovery in manufacturing and other business sectors many participants also noted that their district contacts had reported a pickup in activity in the leisure travel and hospitality sectors those contacts had grown increas ingly optimistic about overall business conditions given ongoing progress on vaccinations easing of restrictions on inperson activities and substantial fiscal support a couple of participants reported improved conditions in the agricultural sector with farmers income supported by higher crop prices and federal aid payments participants commented on the continued improvement in labor market conditions in recent months job gains in the march employment report were strong and the unemployment rate fell to percent even so partic ipants judged that the economy was far from achieving the committees broadbased and inclusive maximum employment goal payroll employment was million jobs below its prepandemic level some participants noted that the labor market recovery continued to be un even across demographic and income groups and across sectors many participants also remarked that business contacts in their districts reported having trouble hiring workers likely reflecting factors such as early retire ments health concerns childcare responsibilities and expanded unemployment insurance benefits many par ticipants noted as well that these factors were depressing the labor force participation rate relative to its prepan demic level some of these factors were seen as likely to remain significant while pandemicrelated risks per sisted based on reports from business contacts some participants noted that the stepup in demand for labor had started to put some upward pressure on wages moreover over the medium term participants expected labor market conditions to continue to improve sup ported by accommodative fiscal and monetary policies as well as continued progress on vaccinations unwind ing of social distancing and the associated recovery in economic activity a couple of participants remarked that businesses in industries severely affected by the pan demic were downsizing or that some businesses were fo cused on cutting costs or increasing productivity partic ularly through automation in their comments about inflation participants antici pated that inflation as measured by the month change of the pce price index would move above percent in the near term as very low readings from early in the pan demic fall out of the calculation in addition increases in oil prices were expected to pass through to consumer energy prices participants also noted that the expected surge in demand as the economy reopens further along with some transitory supply chain bottlenecks would contribute to pce price inflation temporarily running somewhat above percent after the transitory effects of these factors fade participants generally expected measured inflation to ease looking further ahead par ticipants expected inflation to be at levels consistent with achieving the committees objectives over time a num ber of participants remarked that supply chain bottle necks and input shortages may not be resolved quickly and if so these factors could put upward pressure on prices beyond this year they noted that in some indus tries supply chain disruptions appeared to be more per sistent than originally anticipated and reportedly had led to higher input costs despite the expected shortrun fluctuations in measured inflation many participants commented that various measures of longerterm infla tion expectations remained well anchored at levels broadly consistent with achieving the committees longerrun goals participants judged that uncertainty was elevated and that the outlook was highly dependent on the course of the virus amid considerable progress on vaccinations the unwinding of social distancing and strong policy support participants assessed that risks to the outlook were no longer as elevated as in previous months nev ertheless some participants remarked that the pandemic continued to pose downside risks to the economic out look and noted the potential for an uneven recovery in light of new virus strains and potential hesitancy regard ing vaccination as upside risks some participants men tioned that the release of pentup demand accumulated excess household savings and rapid progress on vac cinations amid continued fiscal and monetary support minutes of the meeting of april page could boost economic activity and bring individuals back into the labor force more quickly than currently ex pected some participants mentioned upside risks around the inflation outlook that could arise if tempo rary factors influencing inflation turned out to be more persistent than expected participants who commented on financial stability agreed that the financial sector had shown resilience dur ing the pandemic in large part reflecting strong policy support some remarked that the capital positions and loan loss reserves at large banks remained high and earnings were strong a few participants noted that vul nerabilities from both business and household debt were at a moderate level nevertheless a couple of partici pants highlighted that forbearance programs instituted in response to the pandemic could be masking vulnera bilities among households and businesses regarding as set valuations several participants noted that risk appe tite in capital markets was elevated as equity valuations had risen further ipo activity remained high and risk spreads on corporate bonds were at the bottom of their historical distribution a couple of participants re marked that should investor risk appetite fall an associ ated drop in asset prices coupled with high business and financial leverage could have adverse implications for the real economy a number of participants commented on valuation pressures being somewhat elevated in the housing market some participants mentioned the po tential risks to the financial system stemming from the activities of hedge funds and other leveraged investors commenting on the limited visibility into the activities of these entities or on the prudential riskmanagement practices of dealers primebrokerage businesses some participants highlighted potential vulnerabilities in other parts of the financial system including runprone invest ment funds in shortterm funding and credit markets various participants commented on the prolonged pe riod of low interest rates and highly accommodative fi nancial market conditions and the possibility for these conditions to lead to reachforyield behavior that could raise financial stability risks in their consideration of the stance of monetary policy participants reaffirmed the federal reserves commit ment to using its full range of tools to support the us economy during this challenging time thereby promot ing the committees statutory goals of maximum em ployment and price stability participants agreed that the economy was still far from the committees longerrun goals moreover the path ahead continued to depend on the course of the virus and risks to the economic outlook remained consequently participants judged that the current stance of policy and policy guidance re mained appropriate to foster further economic recovery as well as to achieve inflation that averages percent over time and longerterm inflation expectations that continue to be well anchored at percent participants judged that the committees current guid ance for the federal funds rate and asset purchases was serving the economy well participants also noted that the existing outcomebased guidance implied that the path of the federal funds rate and the balance sheet would depend on actual progress toward reaching the committees maximumemployment and inflation goals in particular some participants emphasized that an im portant feature of the outcomebased guidance was that policy would be set based on observed progress toward the committees goals not on uncertain economic fore casts however a couple of participants commented on the risks of inflation pressures building up to unwelcome levels before they become sufficiently evident to induce a policy reaction in their discussion of the federal reserves asset pur chases various participants noted that it would likely be some time until the economy had made substantial fur ther progress toward the committees maximumem ployment and pricestability goals relative to the condi tions prevailing in december when the committee first provided its guidance for asset purchases con sistent with the committees outcomebased guidance purchases would continue at least at the current pace un til that time many participants highlighted the im portance of the committee clearly communicating its as sessment of progress toward its longerrun goals well in advance of the time when it could be judged substantial enough to warrant a change in the pace of asset pur chases the timing of such communications would de pend on the evolution of the economy and the pace of progress toward the committees goals a number of participants suggested that if the economy continued to make rapid progress toward the committees goals it might be appropriate at some point in upcoming meet ings to begin discussing a plan for adjusting the pace of asset purchases committee policy action in their discussion of monetary policy for this meeting members agreed that the covid pandemic was causing tremendous human and economic hardship across the united states and around the world they noted that amid progress on vaccinations and strong policy support indicators of economic activity and em ployment had strengthened although the sectors most page federal open market committee adversely affected by the pandemic remained weak they had shown improvement inflation had risen largely re flecting transitory factors overall financial conditions remained accommodative in part reflecting policy measures to support the economy and the flow of credit to us households and businesses members also re marked that the path of the economy would depend sig nificantly on the course of the virus including progress on vaccinations in addition members agreed that the ongoing public health crisis continued to weigh on the economy and risks to the economic outlook remained members agreed that the federal reserve was commit ted to using its full range of tools to support the us economy in this challenging time thereby promoting its maximumemployment and pricestability goals all members reaffirmed that in accordance with the com mittees goals to achieve maximum employment and in flation at the rate of percent over the longer run and with inflation running persistently below this longerrun goal they would aim to achieve inflation moderately above percent for some time so that inflation averages percent over time and longerterm inflation expecta tions remain well anchored at percent members ex pected to maintain an accommodative stance of mone tary policy until those outcomes were achieved all members agreed to keep the target range for the fed eral funds rate at to percent and they expected that it would be appropriate to maintain this target range un til labor market conditions had reached levels consistent with the committees assessments of maximum employ ment and inflation had risen to percent and was on track to moderately exceed percent for some time in addition members agreed that it would be appropriate for the federal reserve to continue to increase its hold ings of treasury securities by at least billion per month and agency mortgagebacked securities by at least billion per month until substantial further progress had been made toward the committees maximumem ployment and pricestability goals they judged that these asset purchases would help foster smooth market functioning and accommodative financial conditions thereby supporting the flow of credit to households and businesses members agreed that in assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy they would continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook and that they would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate in the event that risks emerged that could impede the attainment of the committees goals members also concurred that in assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy they would take into account a wide range of information in cluding readings on public health labor market condi tions inflation pressures and inflation expectations and financial and international developments members agreed that the postmeeting statement should acknowledge that indicators of economic activity and employment had strengthened but that despite showing improvement the sectors of the economy most affected by the pandemic remained weak members also judged that while risks to the outlook remained continued pro gress on vaccinations and accommodative monetary and fiscal policies most likely would underpin further gains in economic activity and employment and would limit risks to the outlook as a result they agreed to remove the characterization of risks as considerable in the fomc statement with regard to the characterization of inflation members agreed that the statement should note that inflation had risen but that the increase largely reflected transitory factors they noted that inflation as measured by the month change of the pce price in dex was expected to move above percent as the very low readings from early in the pandemic fell out of the calculation and as past increases in oil prices passed through to consumer energy prices the expected re bound in spending as the economy continued to reopen was also likely to boost inflation temporarily particularly if supply bottlenecks limited how quickly production could respond to demand in the near term however members also viewed these increases in prices as likely to have only transitory effects on inflation at the conclusion of the discussion the committee voted to authorize and direct the federal reserve bank of new york until instructed otherwise to execute transactions in the soma in accordance with the fol lowing domestic policy directive for release at pm effective april the federal open market committee directs the desk to undertake open market operations as nec essary to maintain the federal funds rate in a target range of to percent increase the system open market ac count holdings of treasury securities by

financial economist and senior advisor federal reserve bank of atlanta haitham jendoubi policy and markets analysis manager federal reserve bank of new york discussion of repurchase agreement arrange ments participants resumed their discussion from the april fomc meeting of considerations related to the es tablishment of a domestic standing repurchase agree ment repo facility srf and a standing foreign inter national monetary authorities fima repo facility building on discussion at previous meetings the staff presented considerations for how these facilities might be designed the design considerations were guided by page federal open market committee participants general desire to have these facilities play a backstop role in fostering effective implementation of monetary policy and supporting smooth functioning of markets in april participants highlighted the im portance of designing these facilities in a way that would leave ample room for private market activity while min imizing the potential for stigma promote equitable ac cess to an appropriately broad set of counterparties and be governed by the fomc with these principles and goals in mind the staff presented potential terms for each facility the staff presentation on the potential design of a do mestic srf included establishing the minimum bid rate at basis pointsthe top of the target range for the federal funds rate the staff briefing suggested counter parties for the facility would include primary dealers and would be extended over time to include banks that ex pressed interest in participation the staff presentation noted that such a facility could be limited to only us treasury securities or could accept all securities currently accepted in open market operations omos which in clude treasury securities agency securities and agency mortgagebacked securities mbs the briefing noted that on the one hand restricting eligible collateral for a domestic srf to us treasury securities could mitigate concerns that an srf could encourage counterparties to take on greater liquidity risk on the other hand accept ing agency securities and agency mbs in an srf would be consistent with the structure of current repo opera tions and could help address a greater range of potential repo market pressures from spilling over into the federal funds market the proposed design for a standing fima repo facility was similar in structure to the existing temporary fima repo facility under the draft terms the range of eligible counterparties for the fima repo facility would con tinue to include foreign official institutions largely com prising central banks subject to individual approval the eligible collateral would continue to be limited to us treasury securities the draft terms envisioned that the rate for the fima repo facility would be set equal to the top of the target range for the federal funds rate a rate equal to the minimum bid rate in the draft terms for the domestic srf in their discussion of considerations related to the de sign of a domestic srf a substantial majority restated their view conveyed at the april meeting that the potential benefits of such a facility outweighed the po tential costs participants broadly supported the terms presented by the staff for such a facility several partic ipants noted the importance of setting the minimum bid rate high enough so that the facility was positioned as a backstop while some pointed out the importance of not setting the rate so high that usage of the facility could be stigmatized or that the facility would not sufficiently contain pressures that could spill over into the federal funds market several participants noted that setting an srf rate at the top of the target range for the federal funds rate would be consistent with addressing pressures that could spill over to the federal funds market others remarked that setting the srf rate at the same level as the primary credit rate for borrowing at the discount window would promote equitable access to federal re serve liquidity across banks and counterparties for omos several participants commented that it may also be appropriate to adjust the srf rate over time based on accumulated experience and economic or financial de velopments several participants suggested that in order to ensure an srf continues to be effective it may be appropriate to study the costs and benefits of additional adjustments over time such as moving to a cleared set tlement structure most participants noted the benefits of allowing banks to be counterparties to a domestic srf including more directly addressing liquidity pres sures for participants in the federal funds market and promoting equitable access to liquidity across domestic counterparties many participants judged that it would be appropriate to accept the same set of securities that is currently accepted for omos some participants indi cated that accepting these securities in the domestic srfs operations should increase the effectiveness of the facility in limiting upward pressures in repo markets that could spill over into the federal funds market some other participants noted that limiting acceptable securi ties for srf operations to us treasury securities could have benefits including consistency with the regulatory distinction between us treasury securities and other types of securities potentially limiting the federal re serves footprint in financial markets and maintaining consistency with the structure of the proposed fima repo facility and the overnight reverse repo on rrp facility several participants cautioned that establishing a backstop srf would not diminish the importance of providing a sufficiently ample supply of reserves on an ongoing basis or the need to improve the structural re siliency of the us treasury market a couple of partic ipants reiterated their concerns about converting current ongoing daily repo operations to a standing facility and suggested ways to calibrate the terms of the facility to mitigate these concerns including setting a relatively minutes of the meeting of june page high minimum bid rate or limiting securities eligible for srf operations to only us treasury securities in their discussion of considerations related to the de sign of a standing fima repo facility a substantial ma jority supported the broad structure discussed in the staff presentation many participants generally saw ben efits in keeping the rate at the same level as that in the potential domestic srf in light of the similar nature of the transactions and high quality of the collateral a number of participants remarked that the rate at the fima repo facility could be set at a higher level than at the domestic srf or could be set at a level comparable to that in the federal reserves dollar liquidity swap lines a couple of participants commented on the po tential reputational risks of establishing a standing fima repo facility including those associated with providing liquidity on a standing basis to a wider set of central banks and finance ministries than through existing swap lines these participants reiterated the importance of maintaining welldefined criteria for participation in the facility and suggested that the fomc should receive reg ular reports on the operations and counterparties ap proved for a standing fima repo facility participants agreed that they would continue their dis cussion of design parameters for both a domestic srf and a standing fima repo facility the chair asked the staff to work on a specific proposal that reflected the views expressed by participants at this meeting developments in financial markets and open market operations the manager turned first to a discussion of financial market developments over the intermeeting period on net us financial conditions eased further led by a de cline in treasury yields lower term premiums appeared to be a significant component of the declines as re flected by lower implied volatility on longerterm inter est rates equities rose slightly the broad dollar weak ened and credit spreads were little changed at histori cally tight levels over the period market participants focused on data showing lower employment growth and higher inflation readings than had been expected the median core personal consumption expenditures pce inflation forecast from the open market desks survey of pri mary dealers jumped nearly percentage point from the previous survey however median forecasts for and each rose less than percent suggesting ex pectations for inflationary pressures to subside infla tion compensation as measured by fiveyear breakeven rates on treasury inflationprotected securities peaked in midmay at the highest level in more than a decade but the increase was driven almost entirely by higher in flation compensation at short horizons indeed one yearforward inflation compensation at horizons beyond a year was relatively stable measures of expectations for federal reserve policy were little changed over the period the median re spondent to the desks surveys of primary dealers and market participants continued to expect the pace of fed eral reserve asset purchases to begin to decline in the first quarter of although most respondents also saw a reasonable chance that this decline could occur one quarter earlier or later the median respondent ex pected purchases to end in the fourth quarter of the desks survey measures of the expected path of the target federal funds rate were also fairly steady and the median respondent continued to expect the first target rate increase to occur in the third quarter of nearly all desk survey respondents anticipated that the summary of economic projections would show the me dian committee participant projecting either no increase in the target range or one percentage point increase by the end of the manager noted that downward pressure on money market rates continued over the period banks contin ued to limit growth in their balance sheets by allowing wholesale liabilities to mature and encouraging custom ers to shift some nonoperational deposits to money mar ket funds moreover the supply of treasury bills a pri mary investment for government money market mutual funds fell further against this backdrop the secured overnight financing rate sofr printed at basis point each day in the intermeeting period while the ef fective federal funds rate effr decreased basis point to basis points amid heightened demand and reduced supply for short term investments the on rrp continued to maintain a floor on overnight rates growth in the on rrp and other nonreserve liabilities helped expand the base of federal reserve liabilities supporting asset purchases damping the increase in reserves and easing pressure on bank balance sheets over the next intermeeting period the manager antici pated that further increases in reserves and reductions in bill supply could put additional downward pressure on overnight rates a modest technical adjustment to ad ministered rates could be warranted to maintain the effr well within the target range and support smooth functioning of shortterm funding markets such an ad justment would be expected to raise the federal funds page federal open market committee rate and to lift other overnight rates modestly most re spondents to the desks surveys expected an adminis tered rate adjustment this summer the manager noted that balances at the on rrp facility would likely con tinue to grow over coming months the staff would continue to monitor developments and the manager noted that at some point it could become appropriate to consider raising the counterparty limits for the on rrp the manager provided an update on progress toward winding down a number of emergency facilities estab lished under section of the federal reserve act while market participants took note of the federal re serve boards announcement on winding down the sec ondary market corporate credit facility smccf hold ings it elicited little price response the commencement of exchangetraded funds sales proceeded smoothly all of the smccf assets are expected to be sold by the end of this year finally the manager noted a proposal to request the chairs approval for an extension to the temporary us dollar liquidity swap arrangements to december the extension would benefit the us economy by helping forestall potential pressures in offshore dollar funding markets that could spill over to us financial conditions while much of the global economy remains on an uncertain recovery path from the pandemic should the committee decide to make the fima repo facility standing an extension would also provide suffi cient time for those temporary swap line central banks that are not currently enrolled in the fima repo facility to do so and to become fully operational secretarys note the chair subsequently pro vided approval to the desk following the pro cedures in the authorization for foreign cur rency operations to extend the expiration of the temporary us dollar liquidity swap lines through december by unanimous vote the committee ratified the desks domestic transactions over the intermeeting period there were no intervention operations in foreign curren cies for the systems account during the intermeeting pe riod staff review of the economic situation the information available at the time of the june meeting suggested that us real gross domestic product gdp was expanding in the second quarter at a pace that was faster than in the first quarter of the year more over labor market conditions had improved further in april and may consumer price inflation through aprilas measured by the month percentage change in the pce price indexhad picked up notably largely reflecting transitory factors total nonfarm payroll employment increased solidly over april and may though at a slower monthly pace than over february and march as of may total payroll employment had retraced twothirds of the job losses seen at the onset of the pandemic although employment in the leisure and hospitality sector and in the education sector including both public and private education had bounced back by less over april and may the unem ployment rate edged down and stood at percent in may the unemployment rates for african americans asians and hispanics also moved down although the rates for african americans and hispanics remained well above the national average both the labor force participation rate and the employmenttopopulation ra tio moved up slightly and both measures had recovered only partially from their lows during the pandemic ini tial claims for regular state unemployment insurance benefits had moved down further since midapril and were at the lowest level since the beginning of the pan demic though they remained high relative to their pre pandemic level weekly estimates of privatesector pay rolls constructed by federal reserve board staff using data provided by the payroll processor adp which were available through may suggested that the pace of private employment gains had stepped up late in that month the pace of increases in several measures of labor com pensation had moved up in recent months average hourly earnings for all employees jumped at a sizable monthly rate in april and may even though the large job gains in the leisure and hospitality sectorwhere wages tend to be lower than in other sectorslikely held down the increases in average hourly earnings in these months a staff measure of the month change in the median wage derived from the adp data had stepped up signif icantly in april relative to march the employment cost index of total hourly compensation in the private sector increased at an annual rate of percent in the three months ending in march a notably faster pace than over the previous three months recent month change measures of inflation using ei ther pce prices or the consumer price index cpi were boosted significantly by the base effects of the drop in prices from the spring of rolling out of the calcula tion in addition a surge in demand as the economy re opened further combined with production bottlenecks and supply constraints contributed to the large recent minutes of the meeting of june page monthly price increases total pce price inflation was percent over the months ending in april core pce price inflation which excludes changes in con sumer energy prices and many consumer food prices was percent over the months ending in april in contrast the trimmed mean measure of month pce inflation constructed by the federal reserve bank of dallas was percent in april in may the month change in the cpi was percent while core cpi infla tion was percent over the same period in the second quarter the staffs common inflation expectations index which combines information from many indicators of inflation expectations and inflation compensation had returned to the level that prevailed in a time when inflation was modest real pce increased substantially in march and then was little changed from that high level in april the compo nents of the nominal retail sales data that are used to es timate pce edged down in may but the sales data for the previous two months were revised up markedly pointing to stronger real pce growth than had been in itially estimated combined with reduced social distanc ing and more widespread vaccinations key factors that influence consumer spendingincluding increasing job gains the upward trend in real disposable income high levels of household net worth and low interest rates pointed to strong real pce growth over the rest of the year housing demand continued to be robust with construc tion of singlefamily homes and home sales remaining well above their prepandemic levels and house prices rising appreciably further the incoming data for this sector indicated that residential investment spending was being temporarily held back in the second quarter by ma terials shortages and limited stocks of homes for sale available indicators suggested that equipment and intan gibles investmentparticularly in hightech catego rieswas increasing solidly in the second quarter ris ing orders for nondefense capital goods excluding air craft were running well above the increases in shipments of those goods through april which pointed to addi tional gains in business equipment spending in coming months moreover business investment in the drilling and mining sector appeared to be increasing further as crude oil and natural gas rigs in operationan indicator of drilling investmentcontinued to rise through early june with oil prices moving higher however nominal nonresidential construction spending declined further in april and investment in nonresidential structures out side of the drilling and mining sector looked to remain weak in the current quarter likely reflecting continued hesitation by businesses to commit to building projects with lengthy times to completion and uncertain future returns manufacturing output expanded solidly on balance over april and may output in the motor vehicle and parts sector rose on net although semiconductor short ages were still weighing on vehicle production factory output outside of the motor vehicle sector increased sol idly and production in the mining sector which includes crude oil and natural gas extraction also increased over april and may total real government purchases looked to be about flat on balance in the second quarter data through may indicated that real federal defense spending was rising only slightly and nondefense spending was expected to drop following a firstquarter surge in pandemicrelated expenditures state and local government purchases looked to be increasing significantly as the payrolls of these governments expanded solidly over april and may nominal state and local construction spending how ever edged down in april with the strong economic recovery leading to an improved outlook for state and local tax revenues and the additional federal support for these governments included in the american rescue plan state and local purchases appeared likely to in crease notably over the rest of the year the nominal us international trade deficit widened to a record size in march and then reversed that widening in april real goods exports in march surpassed their january levels for the first time and then continued to grow in april with particular strength in exports of capital goods real goods imports surged to recordhigh levels in march and then stepped back modestly in april bottlenecks in the global semiconductor industry which had weighed on exports and imports of automotive products this year continued to do so through april exports and imports of services remained depressed rel ative to prepandemic levels as international travel in creased only slightly from february recent data pointed to a pickup in foreign economic ac tivity in the second quarter demand improved as socialdistancing restrictions were lifted in the united kingdom and the euro area following the rollout of vac cines with the economic reopening under way pur chasing managers indexes pmis in both the manufac turing and services sectors were strong in europe in april and may in the emerging market economies emes manufacturing pmis and exports were gener page federal open market committee ally robust however many emes continued to strug gle to contain the virus amid a slow pace of vaccinations particularly in south america and parts of asia con sumer price inflation continued to rise in many foreign economies primarily driven by rebounding energy prices and the fading effects of steep price declines seen early last year price increases were concentrated in rel atively few items suggesting that underlying inflationary pressures remained subdued amid considerable eco nomic slack staff review of the financial situation overall financial conditions eased during the intermeet ing period as market participants appeared to remain confident that the economic recovery was broadly on track that inflation over the medium term would stay contained and that monetary policy would remain ac commodative domestic equity prices edged up and corporate bond spreads narrowed a little yields on nominal treasury securities declined modestly since the previous fomc meeting measures of inflation com pensation at shorter horizons moved down somewhat on net while measures of longerterm inflation compen sation were little changed a straight read of overnight index swap ois quotes suggested that the expected path for the federal funds rate moved lower over the in termeeting period and that the expected policy rate would remain below basis points until the first quarter of shortterm funding markets functioned smoothly amid record participation in the on rrp fa cility financing conditions for businesses and house holds remained accommodative particularly for large firms and households with high credit ratings the treasury yield curve flattened a bit on net with year yields about unchanged while and year yields declined somewhat inflation compensation de clined a bit at shorter horizons but held steady at longer horizons market expectations for the federal funds rate path over the medium term as implied by ois quotes unadjusted for term premiums declined moderately broad stock price indexes increased slightly over the in termeeting period with stocks in cyclically sensitive sec tors generally outperforming onemonth option implied volatility on the sp

slightly the effr was nearly con stant throughout the period at basis points while the sofr remained at basis point with rates low and net treasury bill supply contracting government money market funds which at the same time were attracting no table inflows had limited investment options at nonnegative rates as a result on rrp takeup by these funds surged pushing total on rrp participation to record levels in late may and june international financial market participants were focused on news about inflation and monetary policy communi cations in europe strongerthanexpected readings for both inflation and economic activity as well as increased optimism about vaccinations contributed to a rise in marketbased measures of inflation expectations on net european longerterm government bond yields were little changed even as us yields declined and the broad dollar index decreased modestly in emerging markets credit spreads narrowed a bit and capital flows into eme funds continued at a moderate pace equity indexes increased somewhat in both emerging and ad vanced foreign economies financing conditions for nonfinancial firms through capital markets remained highly accommodative as re flected in historically low corporate bond and leveraged loan yields as well as high pricetoearnings ratios in the equity markets gross issuance of corporate bonds and leveraged loans was solid equity raised through tradi tional initial public offerings was robust in april but sof tened to more moderate levels in may and through mid june while the pace of seasoned equity offerings was modest over the intermeeting period meanwhile equity issuance through special purpose acquisition companies slowed markedly commercial and industrial ci loans outstanding at banks fell through midmay with forgiveness of paycheck protection program ppp loans continuing to drive balances down and more than offsetting volumes of new loan originations tepid de mand for loans appears to have been a factor in the de cline in loans outstanding for instance despite healthy growth in ci commitments at large banks over the first quarter there was no corresponding change in the utili zation rates of credit lines the credit quality of large nonfinancial corporations re mained largely stable over the intermeeting period the minutes of the meeting of june page volume of credit rating upgrades for nonfinancial bonds and leveraged loans outpaced downgrades somewhat in the apriltoearlyjune period there were no reported corporate defaults in april and defaults were low in may delinquency rates on bank ci loans also re mained low in the first quarter market indicators of fu ture default expectations were little changed and re mained low relative to their historical range in the municipal bond market financing conditions re mained accommodative over the intermeeting period issuance of municipal bonds was solid in recent months and indicators of the credit quality of municipal debt showed some signs of improvement with the volume of bond upgrades outpacing the volume of bond down grades financing conditions for small businesses were little changed with supply of small business loans remaining tight and demand still subdued outside of the ppp while small business loan originations rose in april sur passing prepandemic levels loans made under the ppp likely accounted for a significant portion of that growth loan performance and other indicators of the financial health of small businesses improved in recent months however in certain sectors such as accommodation and food services small businesses remained stressed for commercial real estate cre financed through cap ital markets financing conditions remained mostly ac commodative over the intermeeting period issuance of commercial mortgagebacked securities cmbs was solid in recent months except in the retail and hotel sec tors spreads of agency cmbs narrowed to below pre pandemic levels meanwhile spreads on nonagency triplea cmbs were little changed at accommodative levels while nonagency tripleb spreads remained ele vated cre loan growth at banks continued to be weak through midmay likely reflecting weak demand as well as tight underwriting standards in the residential mortgage market financing conditions were little changed over the intermeeting period and re mained accommodative for stronger borrowers who met standard conforming loan criteria credit continued to appear tight for borrowers with lower credit scores mortgage rates for most borrowers were little changed on net and remained near historical lows homepur chase and refinance mortgage activity continued at a strong pace through early june the share of mortgages in forbearance declined in may financing conditions for consumer credit remained gen erally accommodative consumer loans grew at a robust pace in april driven by rapid growth in auto loan bal ances credit card balances on banks books rose in may reversing an april decline for subprime borrow ers conditions in the credit card market appeared to have eased somewhat further from the tight conditions seen after the onset of the pandemic conditions in the assetbacked securities market continued to be support ive of lending during the intermeeting period staff economic outlook the us economic projection prepared by the staff for the june fomc meeting was stronger than the april forecast real gdp growth was projected to increase substantially this year with a correspondingly rapid de cline in the unemployment rate further reductions in social distancing and favorable financial conditions were expected to support output growth even though the ef fects of fiscal stimulus on economic growth were start ing to unwind with the boost to growth from contin ued reductions in social distancing assumed to fade after and the further unwinding of fiscal stimulus gdp growth was expected to step down in and nevertheless with monetary policy assumed to remain highly accommodative the staff continued to anticipate that real gdp growth would outpace that of potential over most of this period leading to a decline in the un employment rate to historically low levels the staffs nearterm outlook for inflation was revised up markedly but the staff continued to expect the rise in inflation this year to be transitory the month change in total and core pce prices had moved well above percent in april and incoming cpi data sug gested that pce price inflation would remain high in may the recent month measures of inflation were being boosted significantly by the base effects of the drop in prices from the spring of rolling out of the calculation in addition the surge in demand as the economy reopened further combined with production bottlenecks and supply constraints contributed to the large recent monthly price increases the staff expected the month change in pce prices to gradually move down in coming months reflecting importantly the fading of base effects along with smaller expected monthly price increases but pce price inflation was forecast to still be well above percent at the end of this year over the next year the transitory price increases caused by bottlenecks and supply constraints were ex pected to largely reverse and the growth in demand was forecast to ease as a result inflation was projected to slow to slightly below percent in before moving back up to a bit above percent in supported by high levels of resource utilization page federal open market committee the staff continued to see the uncertainty surrounding the economic outlook as elevated although increasingly widespread vaccinations along with ongoing policy sup port were viewed as helping to diminish some of these uncertainties nevertheless the staff judged that the risks around their strong baseline projection for eco nomic activity were still tilted somewhat to the down side as adverse alternative courses of the pandemic including the possibility of the spread of moreconta gious morevaccineresistant covid variants seemed more likely than outcomes that would be more favorable than in the baseline forecast the staff contin ued to view the risks around the inflation projection as roughly balanced on the upside bottlenecks supply disruptions and historically high rates of resource utili zation were seen as potential sources of greaterthan expected inflationary pressures particularly if there were a significant rise in inflation expectations that altered in flation dynamics on the downside if the effects of sup ply constraints proved to be transitory as expected then the inflation record from the past years suggested the possibility that low underlying trend inflation and a flat phillips curve could cause inflation to revert to relatively low levels despite a strengthening economy participants views on current economic condi tions and the economic outlook in conjunction with this fomc meeting participants submitted their projections of the most likely outcomes for real gdp growth the unemployment rate and infla tion for each year from through and over the longer run based on their individual assessments of ap propriate monetary policy including the path of the fed eral funds rate the longerrun projections represented each participants assessment of the rate to which each variable would be expected to converge over time un der appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy a summary of eco nomic projections was released to the public following the conclusion of the meeting in their discussion of current conditions participants noted that progress on vaccinations had reduced the spread of covid in the united states amid this progress and strong policy support indicators of eco nomic activity and employment had strengthened the sectors most adversely affected by the pandemic re mained weak but had shown improvement inflation had risen largely reflecting transitory factors overall financial conditions remained accommodative in part reflecting policy measures to support the economy and the flow of credit to us households and businesses participants generally noted that the path of the econ omy would depend significantly on the course of the vi rus progress on vaccinations would likely continue to reduce the effects of the public health crisis on the econ omy but risks to the economic outlook remained participants observed that economic activity was ex panding at a historically rapid pace led by robust gains in consumer spending a vast majority of participants revised up their projections for real gdp growth this year compared with the projections they had submitted in march citing stronger consumer demand and im provements in vaccination rates as the primary reasons for these upgrades that said participants generally saw supply disruptions and labor shortages as constraining the expansion of economic activity this year partici pants projections of real gdp growth in and were generally little changed in their discussion of the household sector participants remarked that indicators of consumer spending had con tinued to surge and expected that further gains in spend ing would contribute significantly to the economic re covery many participants commented that accommo dative financial conditions the release of pentup de mand progress on widespread vaccination the ongoing reduction of socialdistancing measures and fiscal stim ulus were important factors supporting spending some participants also noted that consumer spending would likely continue to be bolstered by the ongoing effects from these factors as well as by households elevated level of accumulated savings and generally healthy bal ance sheets a majority of participants observed that housing market activity remained strong with respect to the business sector most participants noted that activity in the service industries most ad versely affected by the pandemic such as in the leisure and hospitality sector was rebounding as the economy reopened a number of participants noted that business equipment investment was rising at a strong pace but growth in manufacturing activity was being restrained by production bottlenecks and supply constraints in addi tion participants reported hearing from contacts in a broad range of industries that shortages of materials and labor as well as supply chain challenges were limiting the ability of firms to keep up with demand some business contacts indicated that they were responding to input shortages and bottlenecks by canceling shifts raising compensation to attract and retain workers raising prices or focusing on cutting costs and increasing productivity particularly through automation minutes of the meeting of june page participants commented on the continued improvement in labor market conditions in recent months job gains in april and may averaged more than and the unemployment rate edged down on net to percent over the period many participants pointed to the ele vated number of job openings and high rates of job switching as further evidence of the improvement in la bor market conditions many participants remarked however that the economy was still far from achieving the committees broadbased and inclusive maximum employment goal and some participants indicated that recent job gains while strong were weaker than they had expected a number of participants noted that the labor market recovery continued to be uneven across demo graphic and income groups and across sectors participants noted that their district contacts had re ported having trouble hiring workers to meet demand likely reflecting factors such as early retirements con cerns about the virus childcare responsibilities and ex panded unemployment insurance benefits some partic ipants remarked that these factors were making people either less able or less inclined to work in the current environment citing recent wage data and reports from business contacts many participants judged that labor shortages were putting upward pressure on wages or leading employers to provide additional financial incen tives to attract and retain workers particularly in lower wage occupations participants expected labor market conditions to continue to improve with labor shortages expected to ease throughout the summer and into the fall as progress on vaccinations continues social distanc ing unwinds further more schools reopen and ex panded unemployment insurance benefits expire in their discussions on inflation participants stated that they had expected inflation to move above percent in the near term in part as the drop in prices from early in the pandemic fell out of the calculation and past in creases in oil prices passed through to consumer energy prices however participants remarked that the actual rise in inflation was larger than anticipated with the month change in the pce price index reaching percent in april participants attributed the upside surprise to more widespread supply constraints in prod uct and labor markets than they had anticipated and to a largerthanexpected surge in consumer demand as the economy reopened they noted that many of their dis trict contacts had reported that higher input costs were putting upward pressure on prices most participants observed that the largest contributors to the rise in meas ured inflation were sectors affected by supply bottle necks or sectors where price levels were rebounding from levels depressed by the pandemic looking ahead participants generally expected inflation to ease as the effect of these transitory factors dissipated but several participants remarked that they anticipated that supply chain limitations and input shortages would put upward pressure on prices into next year several participants noted that during the early months of the reopening uncertainty remained too high to accurately assess how long inflation pressures will be sustained some partici pants commented that recent readings of inflation measures that exclude volatile components such as trimmed mean measures had been relatively stable at or just below percent in their comments on longerterm inflation expectations a number of participants noted that despite increases earlier this year measures of longerterm inflation expectations had remained in ranges that were broadly consistent with the commit tees longerrun inflation goal others noted that it was this years increases that had brought these measures to levels that were broadly consistent with the committees longerrun inflation goal participants noted that overall financial conditions re mained highly accommodative in part reflecting the stance of monetary policy which continued to deliver appropriate support to the economy several partici pants highlighted however that low interest rates were contributing to elevated house prices and that valuation pressures in housing markets might pose financial stabil ity risks in discussing the uncertainty and risks associated with the economic outlook participants commented that the process of reopening the economy was unprecedented and likely to be uneven across sectors some partici pants judged that supply chain disruptions and labor shortages complicated the task of assessing progress to ward the committees goals and that the speed at which these factors would dissipate was uncertain accord ingly participants judged that uncertainty around their economic projections was elevated although they gen erally saw the risks to the outlook for economic activity as broadly balanced a substantial majority of partici pants judged that the risks to their inflation projections were tilted to the upside because of concerns that supply disruptions and labor shortages might linger for longer and might have larger or more persistent effects on prices and wages than they currently assumed several participants expressed concern that longerterm infla tion expectations might rise to inappropriate levels if el evated inflation readings persisted several other partic ipants cautioned that downside risks to inflation re page federal open market committee mained because temporary price pressures might un wind faster than currently anticipated and because the forces that held down inflation and inflation expecta tions during the previous economic expansion had not gone away or might reinforce the effect of the unwind ing of temporary price pressures in their consideration of the stance of monetary policy participants reaffirmed the federal reserves commit ment to using its full range of tools to support the us economy during this challenging time thereby promot ing the committees statutory goals of maximum em ployment and price stability participants generally agreed that the economic recovery was incomplete and that risks to the economic outlook remained although inflation had risen more than anticipated the increase was seen as largely reflecting temporary factors and par ticipants expected inflation to decline toward the com mittees percent longerrun objective participants judged that the current stance of monetary policy and policy guidance remained appropriate to pro mote maximum employment as well as to achieve infla tion that averages percent over time and longerterm inflation expectations that are well anchored at per cent participants also reiterated that the existing out comebased guidance implied that the paths of the fed eral funds rate and the balance sheet would depend on actual progress toward reaching the committees maxi mumemployment and inflation goals in light of the incoming data and the implications for their economic outlooks a few participants mentioned that they ex pected the economic conditions set out in the commit tees forward guidance for the federal funds rate to be met somewhat earlier than they had projected in march several participants emphasized however that uncer tainty around the economic outlook was elevated and that it was too early to draw firm conclusions about the paths of the labor market and inflation in their view this heightened uncertainty regarding the evolution of the economy also implied significant uncertainty about the appropriate path of the federal funds rate some par ticipants noted that communications about the appro priate path of policy would be a focus of market partici pants in the current environment and commented that it would be important to emphasize that the committees reaction function or commitment to its monetary policy framework had not changed participants discussed the federal reserves asset pur chases and progress toward the committees goals since last december when the committee adopted its guid ance for asset purchases the committees standard of substantial further progress was generally seen as not having yet been met though participants expected pro gress to continue various participants mentioned that they expected the conditions for beginning to reduce the pace of asset purchases to be met somewhat earlier than they had anticipated at previous meetings in light of in coming data some participants saw the incoming data as providing a less clear signal about the underlying eco nomic momentum and judged that the committee would have information in coming months to make a better assessment of the path of the labor market and inflation as a result several of these participants em phasized that the committee should be patient in as sessing progress toward its goals and in announcing changes to its plans for asset purchases participants generally judged that as a matter of prudent planning it was important to be well positioned to reduce the pace of asset purchases if appropriate in response to unex pected economic developments including fasterthan anticipated progress toward the committees goals or the emergence of risks that could impede the attainment of the committees goals various participants offered their views on the commit tees agency mbs purchases several participants saw benefits to reducing the pace of these purchases more quickly or earlier than treasury purchases in light of val uation pressures in housing markets several other par ticipants however commented that reducing the pace of treasury and mbs purchases commensurately was preferable because this approach would be well aligned with the committees previous communications or be cause purchases of treasury securities and mbs both provide accommodation through their influence on broader financial conditions in coming meetings par ticipants agreed to continue assessing the economys progress toward the committees goals and to begin to discuss their plans for adjusting the path and composi tion of asset purchases in addition participants reiter ated their intention to provide notice well in advance of an announcement to reduce the pace of purchases with regard to the implementation of monetary policy participants had observed downward pressure on money market rates over the intermeeting period and viewed the possibility of further downward pressure on these rates in the near term as likely consequently they noted that an adjustment to the federal reserves administered rates would help keep the federal funds rate well within the target range and support smooth market functioning of shortterm funding markets participants agreed that minutes of the meeting of june page this technical adjustment had no bearing on the appro priate path for the federal funds rate or the stance of monetary policy committee policy action in their discussion of monetary policy for this meeting members agreed that progress on vaccinations had re duced the spread of covid in the united states they noted that amid progress and strong policy sup port indicators of economic activity and employment had strengthened although the sectors most adversely affected by the pandemic remained weak they had shown improvement inflation had risen largely reflect ing transitory factors overall financial conditions re mained accommodative in part reflecting policy measures to support the economy and the flow of credit to us households and businesses members also agreed that the path of the economy would depend sig nificantly on the course of the virus progress on vac cinations would likely continue to reduce the effects of the public health crisis on the economy but risks to the economic outlook remained members agreed that the federal reserve was commit ted to using its full range of tools to support the us economy in this challenging time thereby promoting its maximumemployment and pricestability goals all members reaffirmed that in accordance with the com mittees goals to achieve maximum employment and in flation at the rate of percent over the longer run and with inflation having run persistently below this longer run goal they would aim to achieve inflation moderately above percent for some time so that inflation averages percent over time and longerterm inflation expecta tions remain well anchored at percent members ex pected to maintain an accommodative stance of mone tary policy until those outcomes were achieved all members agreed to keep the target range for the fed eral funds rate at to percent and they expected that it would be appropriate to maintain this target range un til labor market conditions had reached levels consistent with the committees assessments of maximum employ ment and inflation had risen to percent and was on track to moderately exceed percent for some time in addition members agreed that it would be appropriate for the federal reserve to continue to increase its hold ings of treasury securities by at least billion per month and agency mbs by at least billion per month until substantial further progress had been made toward the committees maximumemployment and pricesta bility goals they judged that these asset purchases would help foster smooth market functioning and ac commodative financial conditions thereby supporting the flow of credit to households and businesses members agreed that in assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy they would continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook and that they would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate in the event that risks emerged that could impede the attainment of the committees goals members also concurred that in assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy they would take into account a wide range of information in cluding readings on public health labor market condi tions inflation pressures and inflation expectations and financial and international developments members judged that the economic outlook had contin ued to improve and that the most negative effects of the pandemic on the economy most likely had occurred as a result they agreed to remove references in the fomc statement that noted that the virus was causing tremen dous human and economic hardship and that the on going public health crisis continues to weigh on the economy instead they agreed to say that progress on vaccinations had reduced the spread of covid and would likely continue to reduce the negative economic effects of the public health crisis at the conclusion of the discussion the committee voted to authorize and direct the federal reserve bank of new york until instructed otherwise to execute transactions in the soma in accordance with the fol lowing domestic policy directive for release at pm

developments in financial markets and open market operations the manager turned first to a discussion of develop ments in financial markets although there were notable moves in some asset prices over the intermeeting period overall financial conditions ended the period little changed at historically accommodative levels market participants seemed to interpret communications associ ated with the june fomc meeting as signaling a less ac commodative path of monetary policy than had been an ticipated implied rates on interest rate futures initially rose following the meeting but subsequently retraced and expectations regarding the path of the target federal funds rate over the next few years ended the period only modestly changed longerterm yields fell notably over the period with the declines concentrated in farforward rates a significant portion of these movements seemed to reflect changes in term premiums market participants pointed to a number of factors as driving the movement in longer term yields most prominently including federal reserve policy communications investor positioning and changes in expectations regarding the course of the pan demic with respect to the path of net asset purchases respond ents to the open market desks surveys of primary deal ers and market participants expected communications on asset purchases to evolve gradually with signals an ticipated over coming months regarding both the com mittees assessment of conditions constituting substan page federal open market committee tial further progress and details on tapering plans al most percent of respondents anticipated the first re duction in the pace of net asset purchases to come in january though on average respondents placed some what more weight than in the june surveys on the possi bility of tapering beginning somewhat earlier with re spect to the pace of tapering respondents continued to anticipate that the committee would take a gradual ap proach while market participants discussed the possi bility of an earlier or fasterthanproportional reduction in the pace of net purchases of agency mortgagebacked securities mbs most survey respondents appeared to expect the timing and pace of tapering of net purchases of agency mbs and treasury securities to be similar the manager turned next to a discussion of develop ments in operations and money markets over the period following the june meeting overnight rates rose in line with the technical adjustment in administered rates and were relatively stable for the remainder of the period overnight reverse repurchase agreement on rrp takeup jumped by over billion after the technical adjustment took effect as governmentsponsored enter prises moved balances held in unremunerated federal reserve deposit accounts into the higheryielding on rrp investments government money market funds also increased their participation in the facility amid a continued decline in treasury bills outstanding and downward pressure on overnight rates overall market participants reported that the technical adjustment went smoothly and that with overnight rates having moved further away from zero concerns about the functioning of shortterm funding markets had diminished looking ahead market participants were beginning to focus on the potential effects of changes in the treasury general account at the federal reserve and treasury bill issuance over coming months in connection with the debt ceiling the manager noted that if a number of counterparties reached the percounterparty limit on their on rrp investments and downward pressure on overnight rates emerged it may become appropriate to lift the limit establishment of standing repurchase agreement facilities finally the manager summarized the proposed terms for the standing repurchase agreement repo facility srf and the foreign and international monetary authorities fima repo facility in questions and comments fol lowing the managers briefing participants expressed broad support for the establishment of the srf and fima repo facility the vast majority of participants supported the proposed terms although a few partici pants raised questions including whether the proposed aggregate cap of billion was necessary whether the collateral eligible in srf operations should be limited to treasury securities only and how the setting of the min imum bid rate in srf operations would be expected to evolve over time relative to the primary credit rate and the interest on reserve balances rate in general partici pants viewed the srf and fima repo facility as im portant new tools serving in backstop roles that would support effective policy implementation and smooth market functioning participants anticipated that the committee would learn more about how these facilities operate over time and noted that it could adjust some parameters of the facilities on the basis of that experi ence the committee voted unanimously to approve the es tablishment of the srf all but one member of the committee voted to approve the fima repo facility governor bowman abstained from voting on the fima repo facility and noted that she would have preferred that the liquidity arrangements accessible to foreign of ficial institutions be maintained only during periods of extraordinary financial market stress rather than through a standing

conditions met the standards of that guidance participants agreed that their discussion at this meeting would be helpful background for the committees future decisions about modifying asset purchases no deci sions regarding future adjustments to asset purchases were made at this meeting the participants discussion was preceded by staff presentations that reviewed the principal channels through which asset purchases exert effects on financial conditions and the economy with a focus on the impli cations of these channels for the committees delibera tions regarding future adjustments to the federal re serves asset purchases the presentations noted that in the staffs standard empirical modeling framework the effect of asset purchases on financial and economic con ditions occurred primarily via their influence on the ex pected path of privatesector holdings of longerterm as sets in that framework larger federal reserve holdings of these assets reduced privatesector holdings exerting downward pressure on term premiums and conse quently keeping longerterm interest rates and overall fi nancial conditions more accommodative than they oth erwise would be the staff noted that because plausible alternative approaches to the tapering of asset purchases would likely not lead to significant differences in the ex pected path of the federal reserves balance sheet these approaches would have similar financial and economic effects in the staffs standard framework the presenta tions highlighted however that alternative tapering ap proaches could have significant financial and economic effects not fully captured in the staffs standard empirical framework in particular changes in asset purchases could be interpreted by the public as signaling a shift in the committees view of the economic outlook or in its overall policy strategy with implications for the ex pected path of the federal funds rate changes in the flow of asset purchases could also influence yields but this influence would likely be modest outside of periods of stressed financial market conditions in their discussion of considerations related to asset pur chases various participants noted that these purchases were an important part of the monetary policy toolkit and a critical aspect of the federal reserves response to the economic effects of the pandemic supporting smooth financial market functioning and accommoda tive financial conditions which aided the flow of credit to households and businesses and supported the recov ery participants discussed a broad range of labor market and inflation indicators all participants assessed that the economy had made progress toward the commit tees maximumemployment and pricestability goals since the adoption of the guidance on asset purchases in december most participants judged that the commit tees standard of substantial further progress toward the maximumemployment goal had not yet been met at the same time most participants remarked that this standard had been achieved with respect to the price page federal open market committee stability goal a few participants noted however that the transitory nature of this years rise in inflation as well as the recent declines in longerterm yields and in mar ketbased measures of inflation compensation cast doubt on the degree of progress that had been made to ward the pricestability goal since december looking ahead most participants noted that provided that the economy were to evolve broadly as they anticipated they judged that it could be appropriate to start reducing the pace of asset purchases this year because they saw the committees substantial further progress criterion as satisfied with respect to the pricestability goal and as close to being satisfied with respect to the maximum employment goal various participants commented that economic and financial conditions would likely warrant a reduction in coming months several others indicated however that a reduction in the pace of asset purchases was more likely to become appropriate early next year because they saw prevailing conditions in the labor mar ket as not being close to meeting the committees sub stantial further progress standard or because of uncer tainty about the degree of progress toward the pricesta bility goal participants agreed that the committee would provide advance notice before making changes to its balance sheet policy participants expressed a range of views on the appropri ate pace of tapering asset purchases once economic con ditions satisfied the criterion laid out in the committees guidance many participants saw potential benefits in a pace of tapering that would end net asset purchases be fore the conditions currently specified in the commit tees forward guidance on the federal funds rate were likely to be met at the same time participants indicated that the standards for raising the target range for the fed eral funds rate were distinct from those associated with tapering asset purchases and remarked that the timing of those actions would depend on the course of the econ omy several participants noted that an earlier start to tapering could be accompanied by more gradual reduc tions in the purchase pace and that such a combination could mitigate the risk of an excessive tightening in fi nancial conditions in response to a tapering announce ment participants exchanged views on what the composition of asset purchases should be during the tapering process most participants remarked that they saw benefits in re ducing the pace of net purchases of treasury securities and agency mbs proportionally in order to end both sets of purchases at the same time these participants ob served that such an approach would be consistent with the committees understanding that purchases of treas ury securities and agency mbs had similar effects on broader financial conditions and played similar roles in the transmission of monetary policy or that these pur chases were not intended as credit allocation some of these participants remarked however that they wel comed further discussion of the appropriate composi tion of asset purchases during the tapering process sev eral participants commented on the benefits that they saw in reducing agency mbs purchases more quickly than treasury securities purchases noting that the hous ing sector was exceptionally strong and did not need ei ther actual or perceived support from the federal re serve in the form of agency mbs purchases or that such purchases could be interpreted as a type of credit alloca tion participants commented on other factors that were rele vant for their consideration of future adjustments to the pace of asset purchases many participants noted that when a reduction in the pace of asset purchases became appropriate it would be important that the committee clearly reaffirm the absence of any mechanical link be tween the timing of tapering and that of an eventual in crease in the target range for the federal funds rate a few participants suggested that the committee would need to be mindful of the risk that a tapering announce ment that was perceived to be premature could bring into question the committees commitment to its new monetary policy framework with respect to the effects of the pandemic several participants indicated that they would adjust their views on the appropriate path of asset purchases if the economic effects of new strains of the virus turned out to be notably worse than currently an ticipated and significantly hindered progress toward the committees goals staff review of the economic situation the information available at the time of the july meeting suggested that us real gross domestic product gdp had increased in the second quarter at a faster pace than in the first quarter of the year indicators of labor market conditions were mixed in june though la bor demand remained strong

unemployment insurance were little changed on net since midjune weekly estimates of privatesector pay rolls constructed by federal reserve board staff using data provided by the payroll processor adp that were available through the first part of july suggested that the pace of private employment gains had remained strong average hourly earnings for all employees rose further in june recent monthly increases in average hourly earnings appeared to reflect a combination of strong la bor demand and increased difficulties in hiring that had more than offset the downward pressure on average earnings from disproportionately large employment gains in lowerwage industries information from com pensation measures that were judged to be less affected by shifts in the composition of the workforce was mixed a staff measure of the month change in the median wage derived from the adp data had stepped up notice ably in june relative to earlier in the year by contrast the wage growth tracker measure constructed by the fed eral reserve bank of atlanta had not shown a similar pickup recent month change measures of inflation using ei ther pce prices or the consumer price index cpi had been boosted by base effects as the extremely low infla tion readings from the spring of rolled out of the calculation in addition a surge in demand as the econ omy reopened further combined with production bot tlenecks and supply constraints had pushed up recent monthly price increases total pce price inflation was percent over the months ending in may and core pce price inflation which excludes changes in con sumer energy prices and many consumer food prices was percent over the months ending in may in contrast the trimmed mean measure of month pce inflation constructed by the federal reserve bank of

previous rounds of federal stimulus payments and reductions in social distancing even so consumer spending appeared to have been held back some as pro ducers struggled to meet demand similarly despite very strong demand for housing incoming data suggested that residential investment spending had declined in the second quarter as materials shortages and limited stocks of homes for sale temporarily restrained activity in that sector available indicators suggested that growth in business fixed investment had slowed sharply in the second quar ter reflecting disruptions to motor vehicle production and aircraft deliveries and a faster rate of decline in non residential structures investment growth in manufacturing output had picked up mod estly in the second quarter although production in the chemicals industry had rebounded from the weatherre lated disruptions earlier in the year the supply chain is sues faced by a number of other industries particularly the motor vehicle industry continued to weigh on over all factory output total real government purchases appeared to have moved lower in the second quarter after having risen in the first quarter available data suggested that federal nondefense purchases had dropped following a first quarter surge in pandemicrelated expenditures and that defense purchases were little changed however indica tors of real state and local purchases pointed to a modest secondquarter increase in this component of govern ment spending the nominal us international trade deficit remained high in may real goods imports in may retraced only a

activity accelerated in the second quarter the improvements were concentrated in the advanced foreign economies and china supported by vaccine rollouts the unwinding of public health re strictions economic adaptation to the virus and the re opening of the services sector the situation was quite different in some emerging market economies emes whose low vaccination rates left them vulnerable to new waves of infections although new covid cases fell dramatically in india after the surge in may and june the situation deteriorated markedly in several southeast asian countries whose cases and deaths rose to alltime highs in addition the increased prevalence of new virus variants particularly the delta variant underscored the continued uncertainty about the foreign outlook infla tion rose further in most foreign economies reflecting a reversal of price declines seen in the spring of higher energy and commodity prices and supply bottle necks staff review of the financial situation over

to its highest level since the facility was put in place from an average of bil lion in the previous intermeeting period to an average of around billion over the current intermeeting pe riod and reached almost trillion on the june quarter end the increase in participation was driven in part by larger investments from money market funds as ongo ing reductions in net treasury bill issuance

raised through seasoned equity offerings continued to be moderate in june meanwhile equity issuance through special purpose acquisition companies remained subdued commercial and industrial ci loans outstanding at banks continued to decline in june with forgiveness of paycheck protection program loans more than offset ting the volumes of new loan originations in the july senior loan officer opinion survey on bank lending practices sloos banks reported easing standards and nearly all terms on net for ci loans over the second quarter the july sloos also indicated that the level of standards on ci loans returned to the easier end of the range that had prevailed since banks surveyed in the july sloos reported that demand for ci loans had improved over the second quarter however market commentary suggested that demand was still generally weak the credit quality of large nonfinancial corporations re mained stable over the intermeeting period the volume of credit rating upgrades for nonfinancial corporate bonds and leveraged loans moderately outpaced down grades in june corporate bond and leveraged loan de faults also remained low financing conditions in the municipal bond market re mained accommodative over the intermeeting period with municipal bond yields edging down to record lows issuance of municipal bonds was solid in the case of higherrated bonds while it was still below prepan demic levels for speculativegrade and unrated securities the credit quality of municipal debt appeared stable al though pandemicrelated risks to state and local govern ment finances remained financing conditions facing small businesses remained relatively tight and their loan demand was generally weak although the july sloos banks reported on net easier lending standards for ci loans to small firms over the second quarter industry commentary suggested that the lending standards of community banks and of other lenders not included in the sloos remained rel

continued to im prove with delinquency rates continuing to decline in may for commercial real estate cre financed through cap ital markets financing conditions remained accommo dative spreads of agency and nonagency commercial mortgagebacked securities cmbs were generally at or below prepandemic levels issuance of agency cmbs remained robust and issuance of nonagency cmbs strengthened notably in june delinquency rates on mortgages in cmbs pools were little changed but con tinued to be elevated on hotel and retail mortgages meanwhile bankbased financing conditions for cre remained relatively tight cre loan growth at banks re mained weak in the second quarter in comparison with prepandemic levels in the july sloos banks re ported that despite some easing over the second quar ter the levels of cre lending standards were still tight relative to the midpoint of the range of standards that had prevailed since financing conditions in the residential real estate market remained accommodative this was particularly true for stronger borrowers who met standard conforming loan criteria in addition according to the july sloos bank lending standards for jumbo loans eased over the second quarter to near their prepandemic levels however al though broad financing conditions for lowerscore fed eral housing administration borrowers also continued to ease their credit standards remained tighter than be fore the pandemic mortgage rates ticked down over the intermeeting period in line with rates on mbs and year treasury securities furthermore the spread of mortgage rates to mbs yields was close to prepandemic levels after having widened significantly at the start of page federal open market committee the pandemic mortgage originations for home pur chases and refinancing were fairly robust through june financing conditions for consumer credit remained ac commodative consumer credit jumped in may and re mained strong in june reflecting a rebound in credit card balances and continued robust growth in auto loans banks in the july sloos reported stronger demand and easier standards for both credit cards and auto loans over the second quarter the staff provided an update on its assessments of the stability of the financial system and on balance charac terized the financial vulnerabilities of the us financial system as notable the staff judged that asset valuation pressures were elevated in particular the forward price toearnings ratio for the sp index stood at the up per end of its historical distribution highyield corporate bond spreads tightened further and were near the low end of their historical range and house prices continued to increase rapidly leaving valuation measures stretched that said the staff did not see signs of loose mortgage underwriting standards or excessive credit growth that could potentially amplify a shock arising from falling house prices the staff assessed vulnerabilities associ ated with nonfinancial leverage as lower than in january but still notable for households the mortgage debtto income ratio was moderate and mortgage borrowing was concentrated among prime borrowers though some uncertainty remained regarding the outlook for mort gages in nonpayment status while measures of corpo ratesector leverage fell since january particularly at the most levered firms the debt of firms that had relatively low earningstointerest payment ratios remained high the staff judged that vulnerabilities arising from finan cial leverage were moderate the aggregate common eq uity tier capital ratio of the largest banks significantly exceeded regulatory requirements however some available measures of hedge fund leverage were elevated and significant data gaps continued to obscure risks at hedge funds and other nonbank financial institutions vulnerabilities associated with funding risks were char acterized as moderate domestic banks held significant quantities of highquality liquid assets and had only lim ited reliance on shortterm wholesale funding none theless significant structural vulnerabilities remained at entities such as prime money funds and new financial arrangements such as stablecoins appeared to have the same structural maturity and liquidity transformation vulnerabilities but with less transparency and an under developed regulatory framework staff economic outlook the projection for us economic activity prepared by the staff for the july fomc meeting was little changed on balance from the june forecast in the second half of an easing of the surge in demand seen over the first part of the year was expected to be largely offset by a reduction in the effects of supply constraints on pro duction thereby allowing real gdp growth to continue at a rapid pace for the year as a whole therefore real gdp was projected to post a substantial increase with a correspondingly large decline in the unemployment rate with the boost to spending growth from continued re ductions in social distancing assumed to fade after and with a further unwinding of the effects of fiscal stim ulus gdp growth was expected to step down in and however with monetary policy assumed to remain highly accommodative the staff continued to an ticipate that real gdp growth would outpace growth in potential output over most of this period leading to a decline in the unemployment rate to historically low lev els the staffs nearterm outlook for inflation was revised up further in response to incoming data but the staff continued to expect that this years rise in inflation would prove to be transitory the month change in total and core pce prices was well above percent in may and available data suggested that pce price infla tion would remain high in june the staff continued to judge that the surge in demand that had resulted as the economy reopened further had combined with produc tion bottlenecks and supply constraints to boost recent monthly inflation rates the staff expected the month change in pce prices to move down gradually over the second part of reflecting an anticipated moderation in monthly inflation rates and the waning of base effects even so pce price inflation was projected to be running well above percent at the end of the year over the following year the boost to consumer prices caused by supply issues was expected to partly reverse and import prices were expected to decelerate sharply as a result pce price inflation was expected to step down to a little below percent in before addi tional increases in resource utilization raised it to per cent in the staff continued to judge that the risks to the baseline projection for economic activity were skewed to the downside and that the uncertainty around the forecast was elevated in particular the probability that the course of the pandemic would turn out to be more ad verse than the staffs baseline assumption was viewed to minutes of the meeting of july page be higher than the probability that a more favorable out come would occur however the staff judged that the risks around the inflation projection were now tilted to the upside as recent data pointed to a greater risk that the upward pressure on inflation that had resulted from supplyrelated issues would unwind more slowly than the staffs baseline projection assumed participants views on current economic condi tions and the economic outlook in their discussion of current conditions participants noted that with progress on vaccinations and strong policy support indicators of economic activity and em ployment had continued to strengthen the sectors most adversely affected by the pandemic had shown im provement but had not fully recovered inflation had risen largely reflecting transitory factors overall finan cial conditions remained accommodative in part reflect ing policy measures to support the economy and the flow of credit to us households and businesses par ticipants noted that the path of the economy would con tinue to depend on the course of the virus progress on vaccinations would likely continue to reduce the effects of the public health crisis on the economy but risks to the economic outlook remained participants observed that economic activity continued to expand at a rapid pace through the middle of the year even though capacity constraints were restraining the in crease in output in some sectors economic growth was expected to remain strong over the second half of the year supported by the further reopening of the econ omy accommodative financial conditions and easing of supply constraints nevertheless participants generally saw supply disruptions and labor shortages as likely to persist over the second half of the year in their discussion of the household sector participants remarked that consumer spending had continued to in crease at a very rapid pace supported by the ongoing reopening of the economy along with the accommoda tion provided by fiscal policy and monetary policy in addition the accumulated stock of savings and further progress on vaccination were cited as important factors lifting household spending some participants noted that they expected consumer spending to continue to be bolstered by these factors participants generally ex pected housing demand to remain strong but noted that construction had been restrained by shortages of mate rials and other inputs and that home sales had been held back by limited supplies of available homes with respect to the business sector participants ob served that activity in the service industries most ad versely affected by the pandemic such as in the leisure and hospitality sector was rebounding as the economy reopened further but had not fully recovered partici pants noted that growth in manufacturing activity con tinued to be solid but was restrained by production bot tlenecks and supply constraints particularly in the motor vehicle sector citing reports received from contacts in a broad range of industries participants indicated that shortages of materials and labor as well as supply chain challenges remained widespread and continued to limit the ability of firms to keep up with strong demand even though their outlook for demand had improved further many business contacts had expressed uncertainty and pessimism over prospects regarding the easing of supply constraints over the near term participants commented on the continued improvement in labor market conditions in recent months driven by strong demand for workers the monthly pace of job gains had picked up with employment expanding in june and with notable increases in the leisure and hospitality sector nevertheless the household sur vey showed that the unemployment rate remained ele vated at percent in june and the labor force partici pation rate and employmenttopopulation ratio were lit tle changed in recent months participants indicated that the economy had not yet achieved the committees broadbased and inclusive maximumemployment goal several participants remarked that the labor market re covery continued to be uneven across demographic and income groups and across sectors participants generally noted that supplyside factors related to the pandemic such as caregiving needs ongoing fears of the virus in creased retirements and expanded unemployment in surance paymentscontinued to weigh on labor force participation and employment growth a majority of participants anticipated that most of these factors would ease in the coming months they also noted however that the spread of the delta variant may temporarily de lay the full reopening of the economy and restrain hiring and labor supply participants observed that recent wage increases had been moderate on average however district contacts had continued to report having trouble hiring workers and had indicated that this difficulty was putting upward pressure on wages in some sectors or leading employers to provide additional incentives to attract and retain workers several participants noted that their district contacts expected that difficulties finding workers would likely extend into the fall page federal open market committee in their discussion of inflation participants observed that the inflation rate had increased notably and ex pected that it would likely remain elevated in coming months before moderating participants remarked that inflation had increased generally more than expected this year and attributed this increase to supply constraints in product and labor markets and a surge in consumer de mand as the economy reopened they noted that many of their district contacts had reported that higher input costs were also putting upward pressure on prices many participants pointed out that the largest contributors to recent increases in measures of inflation were a handful of sectors most affected by temporary supply bottle necks or sectors in which price levels were rebounding from depressed levels as the economy continued to reo pen looking ahead while participants generally ex pected inflation pressures to ease as the effect of these transitory factors dissipated several participants re marked that largerthananticipated supply chain disrup tions and increases in input costs could sustain upward pressure on prices into in their comments on in flation expectations some participants noted that measures of longerterm inflation expectations had re mained in ranges that were viewed as broadly consistent with the committees longerrun inflation goal several participants indicated that the recent increases in survey based measures signaled a risk that longerterm inflation expectations might be moving up above levels consistent with the committees goals other participants pointed to the substantial decline in tipsbased longerterm in flation compensation since june as suggesting that inves tors perceived reduced risks that inflation could run per sistently above the committees percent goal a cou ple of participants noted that recent readings on forward inflation compensation could be read as suggesting in vestor concern that inflation over the longer term could run persistently below the committees percent infla tion goal in discussing the uncertainty and risks associated with the economic outlook many participants remarked that uncertainty was quite high with slowing in progress on vaccinations and developments surrounding the delta variant posing downside risks to the economic outlook a number of participants judged that the effects of sup ply chain disruptions and labor shortages would likely complicate the task of interpreting the incoming data and assessing the speed at which these supplyside fac tors would dissipate some participants noted that there were upside risks to inflation associated with concerns that supply disruptions and labor shortages might linger for longer than currently anticipated and might have larger or more persistent effects on prices and wages than they currently assumed participants who commented on financial stability em phasized the risks associated with elevated valuations across many asset classes a few participants highlighted scenarios in which a prolonged period of low interest rates and broadly elevated asset valuations could gener ate imbalances which could increase financial stability risks some participants commented on the housing market and noted that ongoing rapid house price in creases reflected both demand and supply factors sev eral participants noted that the lack of evidence of dete riorating mortgage underwriting standards could miti gate risks associated with high housing valuations a cou ple of other participants however expressed concern that a home price reversal could pose risks to financial stability some participants cited various potential risks to financial stability including the risks associated with expanded use of cryptocurrencies or the risks associated with collateral liquidity at central counterparties during episodes of market stress in connection with the for mer set of risks a few of these participants highlighted the fragility and the general lack of transparency associ ated with stablecoins the importance of monitoring them closely and the need to develop an appropriate regulatory framework to address any risks to financial stability associated with such products in their consideration of the stance of monetary policy participants reaffirmed the federal reserves commit ment to using its full range of tools to support the us economy during this challenging time thereby pro moting the committees statutory goals of maximum employment and price stability participants judged that the current stance of monetary policy remained appro priate to promote maximum employment as well as to achieve inflation that averages percent over time and longerterm inflation expectations that are well anchored at percent participants also reiterated that the existing outcomebased guidance implied that the paths of the federal funds rate and the balance sheet would depend on actual progress toward reaching the committees maximumemployment and inflation goals participants discussed the progress toward the commit tees goals since december when the committee adopted its guidance for asset purchases they generally judged that the committees standard of substantial further progress toward the maximumemployment and inflation goals had not yet been met particularly with respect to labor market conditions and that risks to minutes of the meeting of july page the economic outlook remained most participants an ticipated that the economy would continue to make pro gress toward those goals and provided that the economy evolved broadly as they anticipated they judged that the standard set out in the committees guidance regarding asset purchases could be reached this year with regard to the labor market participants noted that the demand for workers had been strong in recent months while the level of employment had been constrained by labor sup ply shortages and hiring difficulties several participants emphasized that employment remained well below its prepandemic level and that a robust labor market sup ported by a continuation of accommodative monetary policy would allow further progress toward the com mittees broad and inclusive maximumemployment goal and a return over time to labor market conditions as strong as those prevailing before the pandemic a few other participants judged that monetary policy had lim ited ability to address the labor supply shortages and hir ing difficulties currently constraining the level of em ployment several participants also commented that the pandemic might have caused longerlasting changes in the labor market and that the prepandemic labor market conditions may not be the right benchmark against which the committee should assess the progress toward its maximumemployment objective with regard to inflation participants commented that re cent inflation readings had been boosted by the effects of supply bottlenecks and labor shortages and were likely to be transitory a few participants noted that while the specific results depended on the period used in the cal culation some measures of average inflation were al ready moving above or would soon move above the committees percent goal supported by strong de mand a tight labor market and firming inflation expec tations some other participants emphasized that recent high inflation readings had largely been driven by price increases in a handful of categories these participants pointed out that there was no evidence of broadbased price pressures or of inappropriately high longerterm inflation expectations several participants also com mented that price increases concentrated in a small num ber of categories were unlikely to change underlying in flation dynamics sufficiently to overcome the possibility of a persistent downward bias in inflation as might be associated with the effective lower bound on the policy rate many participants remarked upon riskmanagement considerations when contemplating how and when to make changes to the committees pace of asset pur chases some participants suggested that it would be prudent for the committee to prepare for starting to re duce its pace of asset purchases relatively soon in light of the risk that the recent high inflation readings could prove to be more persistent than they had anticipated and because an earlier start to reducing asset purchases would most likely enable additions to securities holdings to be concluded before the committee judged it appro priate to raise the federal funds rate a few participants expressed concerns that maintaining highly accommo dative financial conditions might contribute to a further buildup in risk to the financial system that could impede the attainment of the committees dualmandate goals in contrast a few other participants suggested that prep arations for reducing the pace of asset purchases should encompass the possibility that the reductions might not occur for some time and highlighted the risks that rising covid cases associated with the spread of the delta variant could cause delays in returning to work and school and so damp the economic recovery several par ticipants also remained concerned about the medium term outlook for inflation and the possibility of the reemergence of significant downward pressure on infla tion especially in light of the recent decline in longer term inflation compensation in addition several partic ipants emphasized that there was considerable uncer tainty about the likely resolution of the labor market shortages and supply bottlenecks and about the influ ence of pandemicrelated developments on longerrun labor market and inflation dynamics those participants stressed that the committee should be patient in as sessing progress toward its goals and in announcing changes to its plans on asset purchases some participants emphasized that a decision to reduce the committees pace of asset purchases once the sub stantial further progress benchmark had been achieved would be fully consistent with the committees new monetary policy framework and would help foster the achievement of the committees longerrun objectives over time a couple of participants also noted that a ta pering of asset purchases did not amount to a tightening of the stance of monetary policy and instead only im plied that additional monetary accommodation would be provided at a slower rate several participants empha sized that an announcement of a reduction in the com mittees pace of asset purchases should not be inter preted as the beginning of a predetermined course for raising the federal funds rate from its current level those participants stressed that the committees assess ment regarding the appropriate timing of an increase in the target range for the federal funds rate was separate from its current deliberations on asset purchases and page federal open market committee would be subject to the higher standard as laid out in the committees outcomebased guidance on the federal funds rate nonetheless a couple of participants cau tioned that it could be challenging for the public to dis entangle deliberations about the two tools and that any decisions the committee made on its asset purchases would likely influence the publics understanding of the committees other policy intentions including with re gard to future decisions concerning the target range for the federal funds rate committee policy action in their discussion of monetary policy for this meeting members agreed that with progress on vaccinations and strong policy support indicators of economic activity and employment had continued to strengthen they noted that the sectors most adversely affected by the pandemic had shown improvement but had not fully re covered inflation had risen largely reflecting transitory factors overall financial conditions remained accom modative in part reflecting policy measures to support the economy and the flow of credit to us households and businesses members also acknowledged that the path of the economy continued to depend on the course of the virus progress on vaccinations would likely con tinue to reduce the effects of the public health crisis on the economy but risks to the economic outlook re mained members agreed that the federal reserve was commit ted to using its full range of tools to support the us economy in this challenging time thereby promoting its maximumemployment and pricestability goals all members reaffirmed that in accordance with the com mittees goals to achieve maximum employment and in flation at the rate of percent over the longer run and with inflation having run persistently below this longer run goal they would aim to achieve inflation moderately above percent for some time so that inflation averages percent over time and longerterm inflation expecta tions remain well anchored at percent members ex pected to maintain an accommodative stance of mone tary policy until those outcomes were achieved all members agreed to keep the target range for the fed eral funds rate at to percent and they expected that it would be appropriate to maintain this target range un til labor market conditions had reached levels consistent with the committees assessments of maximum employ ment and inflation had risen to percent and was on track to moderately exceed percent for some time last december the committee indicated that it would continue to increase its holdings of treasury securities by at least billion per month and agency mortgage backed securities by at least billion per month until substantial further progress had been made toward its maximumemployment and pricestability goals the members commented that since then the economy had made progress toward these goals and they agreed to continue to assess progress in coming meetings they judged that these asset purchases would help foster smooth market functioning and accommodative finan cial conditions thereby supporting the flow of credit to households and businesses members agreed that in assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy they would continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook and that they would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate in the event that risks emerged that could impede the attainment of the committees goals members also concurred that in assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy they would take into account a wide range of information in cluding readings on public health labor market condi tions inflation pressures and inflation expectations and financial and international developments members agreed that the postmeeting statement should acknowledge the economys continued recovery as well as its progress toward the committees maximumem ployment and pricestability goals set forth in the com mittees asset purchase guidance in december in light of these developments members decided to remove the characterization of sectors most adversely affected by the pandemic as being in a weak condition and to re place it with the judgment that those sectors have not fully recovered they also agreed to remove the word significantly when characterizing the dependence of the path of the economy on the course of the virus in addition members agreed to insert the assessment that the economy has made progress toward the commit tees longerrun goals since the guidance on asset pur chases was first issued in december and to indicate that the assessment of progress would continue in coming meetings members agreed that the addition of this lan guage was appropriate to acknowledge the committees ongoing deliberations in assessing the economys pro gress toward the committees goals and the implications for the pace of asset purchases at the conclusion of the discussion the committee voted to authorize

economist federal reserve bank of dallas attended tuesdays session only keshav dogra senior economist federal reserve bank of new york developments in financial markets and open market operations the manager turned first to a discussion of financial market developments over the period domestic finan cial conditions were little changed on net and remained highly accommodative the spread of the delta variant of the covid virus weighed on the nearterm growth outlook and median respondents to the open market desks survey of primary dealers marked down projections for gross domestic product gdp growth and revised up projections for inflation this year none theless expectations for the trajectory of growth beyond were little changed implied forward inflation compensation two to four years ahead based on treas ury inflationprotected securities tips increased mod estly over the intermeeting period regarding the outlook for monetary policy market par ticipants noted policymaker communications suggesting that tapering of asset purchases could begin this year and end by mid around half of respondents to the desks surveys of primary dealers and market partici pants viewed december as the most likely timing of the first reduction in the net pace of purchases although re spondents also attached significant probability to the first reduction coming in november median expecta tions for the pace of net purchases were consistent with a gradual tapering of net purchases being completed in july of next year about one to two months earlier than in the previous surveys expectations for the target fed eral funds rate based on survey responses and interest rate futures moved up slightly since the previous meet ing several central banks announced reductions in the pace of their asset purchase programs or eventual plans for their balance sheets once asset purchases had been com pleted these announcements were broadly in line with market participants expectations and elicited only a modest reaction in financial markets in latin america and emerging europe some central banks recently tight ened policy to address rising inflation pressures inves tors remained focused on other vulnerabilities in emerg ing markets and concerns had grown recently about the possible implications of developments in china the manager turned next to a discussion of money mar kets and federal reserve operations domestic funding attended the discussion of economic developments and the outlook page federal open market committee conditions were stable over the period the federal funds rate edged lower amid ongoing increases in re serves but it remained well within the target range the secured overnight financing rate sofr was steady at basis points participation in the overnight reverse re purchase agreement on rrp facility increased to an average of just over trillion over the period driven primarily by increased usage by government money mar ket funds market participants were attentive over the period to negotiations on the debt limit yields on treasury bills maturing in midoctober to midnovem ber had become modestly elevated as investors reduced exposures to securities that could be at risk for delayed payments market participants noted information in the public domain about measures the federal reserve and the treasury could take around a debt limit event they pointed in particular to the october fomc meet ing minutes which highlighted that the federal reserve would use normal procedures in its operations both as the debt limit nears and in the event of a delayed pay ment market participants also focused on a report by the treasury market practices group tmpg which outlined a process that could be used to delay principal payments on treasury securities by rolling forward the operational maturity date in order to maintain the ability to transfer such securities over fedwire the tmpg report noted that such a procedure would help support ongoing functioning of markets for securities with de layed payments this would maintain their eligibility in open market operations under normal procedures nev ertheless market participants emphasized that even with these procedures a delayed payment would create severe and broadbased market disruption in light of increased usage of the on rrp facility and the potential for continued downward pressure on shortterm interest rates over the near term the manager next discussed a staff proposal to increase the per counterparty limit for the on rrp facility to bil lion staff analysis suggested that the proposed increase was likely to be sufficient to support effective policy im plementation for most foreseeable circumstances the manager provided a brief update on the new repur chase agreement repo facilities that the committee had announced following its meeting in july the desk had been working to onboard depository institutions as ad ditional counterparties for the standing repo facility in addition a number of foreign central banks had ex pressed intent to establish access to the foreign and in ternational monetary authority repo facility by unanimous vote the committee ratified the desks domestic transactions over the intermeeting period there were no intervention operations in foreign curren cies for the systems account during the intermeeting pe riod staff review of the economic situation the information available at the time of the septem ber meeting suggested that us real gdp was in creasing in the third quarter at a slower pace than in the second quarter of the year the pace of improvement in labor market conditions had remained very rapid in july but slowed sharply in august consumer price inflation in june and julyas measured by the month percent age change in the personal consumption expenditures pce price indexwas elevated total nonfarm payroll employment increased sharply in july but rose much less rapidly in august with job gains in the leisure and hospitality sector slowing to zero in addition state and local government employment was reported to have fallen in august though abnormal sea sonal swings had likely distorted recent readings for this sector as of august total payroll employment had re traced threefourths of the losses seen at the onset of the pandemic the unemployment rate had declined from percent in june to percent in august although the unemployment rates for african americans and his panics had also declined on net over this period both rates remained well above the national average the la bor force participation rate edged up on net and the employmenttopopulation epop ratio rose further in july and august privatesector job openings as meas ured by the job openings and labor turnover survey increased further in july and continued to suggest that labor demand was extraordinarily high initial claims for regular state unemployment insurance remained near the pandemicperiod low that had been reached in early sep tember but were still somewhat elevated relative to pre pandemic levels weekly estimates of privatesector pay rolls constructed by the boards staff using data pro vided by the payroll processor adp that were available through early september pointed to a modest pickup in the pace of private employment gains relative to august average hourly earnings for all employees rose strongly in july and august with gains that were widespread across industries recent monthly increases in average hourly earnings appeared to reflect a combination of continued strong labor demand and increased difficul ties in hiring a staff measure of the month change in the median wage derived from the adp data had also pointed to strong wage growth with a pace in august minutes of the meeting of september page that was well above the growth rates seen before the pandemic by contrast the wage growth tracker meas ure constructed by the federal reserve bank of atlanta had not shown a similar pickup the employment cost index of hourly compensation in the private sector which also includes benefit costs rose at an annual rate of percent over the months ending in june per centage point faster than the month change posted in december inflation as measured by either the pce price index or the consumer price index cpi had been boosted by a surge in demand as the economy reopened further along with the effects of production bottlenecks and supply constraints total pce price inflation was percent over the months ending in july and core pce price inflation which excludes changes in consumer energy prices and many consumer food prices was percent over the months ending in july in contrast the trimmed mean measure of month pce inflation con structed by the federal reserve bank of dallas was percent in july in august the month change in the cpi was percent while the core cpi rose per cent over the same period in the third quarter of the staffs common inflation expectations index which combines information from many indicators of inflation expectations and inflation compensation was little changed relative to the second quarter and was near its average over the decade before the pandemic although real pce declined in july the components of retail sales used to estimate pce rose strongly in august returning to levels seen in the spring however con cerns about the course of the pandemic appeared to be weighing on consumer services spending as available in dicators pointed to a slowing in demand for services sen sitive to social distancing in addition measures of con sumer confidence had moved lower in august demand for housing appeared to have remained very strong but incoming data suggested that materials shortages and a lack of developed lots for construction were restraining residential building activity available indicators suggested that growth in business fixed investment was slowing somewhat in the third quarter as supply bottlenecksparticularly for motor vehiclesweighed on business equipment spending manufacturing output rose strongly in july and ticked up further in august in august activity in the oil and gas sector and production of petrochemicals had been held down by shutdowns related to hurricane ida supply chain issues faced by a number of other industries also continued to be a drag on overall factory output total real government purchases appeared to be increas ing in the third quarter after having moved lower in the second quarter available data suggested that federal nondefense purchases were declining sharply in the third quarter but that robust gains in real state and local pur chases were offsetting this decline the us international trade deficit remained high in july after rising in june real goods imports fell back in july held down by a sizable decline in consumer goods imports but the levels of consumer and total goods im ports remained well above precovid levels real goods exports edged up in july and were close to pre pandemic levels bottlenecks in the global semiconduc tor industry continued to weigh on exports and imports of automotive products and shipping congestion con tinued to restrain trade overall exports and imports of services rose again in july but they remained low relative to prepandemic levels largely because international travel was still depressed in the advanced foreign economies afes where high vaccination rates had increased resilience to covid outbreaks incoming data were consistent with economic growth in the third quarter at a slightly faster pace than in the second quarter with the economic reopening un der way purchasing managers indexes for both manu facturing and services remained strong in europe and canada conversely in emerging market economies emesespecially in southeast asia where vaccina tion rates were lowera global resurgence in covid infections due to the delta variant led to renewals of public health restrictions these restrictions weakened retail sales and contributed to labor shortages and trans portation congestion disrupting global supply chains inflation abroad was elevated reflecting reversals of price declines early in the pandemic past increases in en ergy and commodity prices upward pressures from sup ply bottlenecks and past exchange rate depreciations in some emes staff review of the financial situation financial market prices were little changed over the in termeeting period concerns over the period about the effects of covid developments on economic per formance

increased slightly but remained well below prepandemic levels on september stock market prices fell notably and speculativegrade yield spreads widened amid rising con cerns about the creditworthiness of a chinese property developer but these moves were mostly reversed during the following day particularly in the stock market shortterm funding markets were stable over the inter meeting period the effective federal funds rate de clined slightly from basis points at the beginning of the period to basis points at the end while the sofr remained at basis points throughout the period assets under

measures in domestic credit markets large nonfinancial firms had ample access to marketbased financing as market par ticipants appeared confident in the domestic corporate credit outlook after accounting for the seasonal sum mer lull in activity gross corporate bond issuance re mained solid in july and august leveraged loan issu ance was also strong in july and august equity funding raised through traditional initial public offerings re mained robust over the summer while equity issuance through special purpose acquisition companies re mained at the subdued levels seen in recent months commercial and industrial ci loans declined notably through august amid ongoing forgiveness of paycheck protection program ppp loans excluding ppp loans ci loan balances were estimated to have been largely unchanged between june and july the credit quality of large nonfinancial corporations re mained strong with a positive outlook the volume of credit rating upgrades for nonfinancial bonds outpaced downgrades noticeably in july and august trailing de fault rates on corporate bonds and leveraged loans re mained low as did market indicators of future default expectations in the municipal bond market financing conditions re mained accommodative issuance of municipal debt was strong in july and august and indicators of credit quality of municipal debt remained healthy though municipal

represent a very small fraction of the municipal market surveybased indicators suggest small business owners especially from covidsensitive sectors that include lodging and food services arts

demand in august financing conditions in commercial real estate cre improved over the intermeeting period amid increasing cre property prices cre loan growth at banks strengthened and issuance of commercial mortgage backed securities cmbs remained robust over the summer spreads of agency cmbs were generally at or below prepandemic levels strong investor appetite for cmbs was supported by falling delinquency rates on mortgages although delinquency rates remained ele vated for cmbs backed by hotel and retail properties financing remained limited for the hardhit hotel sector in the residential mortgage market financing conditions remained accommodative particularly for borrowers who met standard conforming loan criteria mortgage rates increased slightly over the intermeeting period but remained very low by historical standards credit avail ability continued to improve especially for jumbo loans and lowerscore federal housing administration bor rowers indicators of mortgage originations for home purchases and refinancing were solid through august the share of mortgages in forbearance declined further in july and august financing conditions for consumer credit remained ac commodative for most borrowers especially those with stronger credit scores consumer credit and the credit card market expanded at a strong pace in june before stepping down somewhat in july conditions for nonprime consumers in the credit card market eased from tight levels auto loan growth slowed in june and july from its brisk pace in may conditions in the asset backed securities market were robust over the intermeet ing period staff economic outlook the projection for us economic activity prepared by the staff for the september fomc meeting was broadly similar to the july projection in the second half of supply constraints were expected to resolve more slowly than previously assumed in addition the recent rise in covid cases was viewed as likely to exert a larger amount of restraint on consumer spending hiring and labor supply than previously anticipated even so real gdp was expected to post a sizable gain over the second half of and over the year as a whole resulting in a correspondingly large decline in the unemployment rate in gdp was expected to rise more slowly than in but at a stillsolid pace supported by the continued reopening of the economy and an easing of supply con straints with the boost from these factors fading real gdp growth was projected to step down noticeably in and to be roughly equal to potential output growth in and however the level of real gdp was expected to remain well above potential throughout the projection period resulting in a decline in the unemploy ment rate to historically low levels the staffs nearterm outlook for inflation was revised up further in response to incoming data but the staff continued to expect that this years rise in inflation would prove to be transitory the month change in total and core pce prices was well above percent in july and available data suggested that pce price infla tion had remained high in august the staff interpreted recent inflation data as indicating that supply constraints were putting a larger amount of upward pressure on prices than previously anticipated relative to the july projection these supply constraints were also expected to take longer to resolve as a result the month change in pce prices was projected to hold roughly steady over the remainder of and to end the year well above percent over the following year the boost to consumer prices caused by supply issues was expected to partly reverse and import prices were expected to de celerate sharply pce price inflation was therefore ex pected to step down to a little below percent in thereafter additional increases in resource utilization were expected to cause it to gradually edge higher and to reach percent in the staff continued to judge that the risks to the baseline projection for economic activity were skewed to the downside in particular the future course of the pan demic was seen as an important source of downside risk the staff also continued to judge that the risks around the inflation projection were tilted to the upside with the possibility of more severe and persistent supply issues viewed as especially salient in addition the staff pointed to a risk that longerrun inflation expectations would move appreciably higher and lead to persistently elevated inflation participants views on current economic condi tions and the economic outlook in conjunction with this fomc meeting participants submitted their projections of the most likely outcomes for real gdp growth the unemployment rate and infla tion for each year from through and over the longer run based on their individual assessments of ap propriate monetary policy including the path of the fed eral funds rate the longerrun projections represented each participants assessment of the rate to which each page federal open market committee variable would be expected to converge over time un der appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy a summary of eco nomic projections was released to the public following the conclusion of the meeting in their discussion of current conditions participants noted that with progress on vaccinations and strong policy support indicators of economic activity and em ployment had continued to strengthen the sectors most adversely affected by the pandemic had improved in recent months but the rise in covid cases had slowed their recovery inflation was elevated largely re flecting transitory factors overall financial conditions remained accommodative in part reflecting policy measures to support the economy and the flow of credit to us households and businesses participants noted that the path of the economy continued to depend on the course of the virus progress on vaccinations would likely continue to reduce the effects of the public health crisis on the economy but risks to the economic outlook remained participants observed that economic activity had contin ued to expand in recent months though at a less rapid pace than in the first half of the year they marked down their projections of real gdp growth for the year point ing to a reassessment of the severity and likely duration of supply constraints or of the effects of the spread of the delta variant on the economy still participants foresaw rapid growth this year and several highlighted that the economy had shown resilience in the face of the recent wave of infections in their discussion of the household sector participants noted that consumer spending had decelerated in recent months after expanding at a very rapid pace in the first half of the year the spread of the delta variant was weighing on spending for some consumer services and low inventories and high prices due to supply constraints were restraining spending on many goods most notably motor vehicles nonetheless participants expected the accumulated stock of savings the release of pentup de mand and progress on vaccinations to continue to sup port household spending in coming months partici pants noted that residential construction had been re strained by shortages of materials and other inputs and that home sales had been held back by limited supplies of available homes with respect to the business sector participants ob served that firms in a number of industries were facing challenges keeping up with strong demand due to wide spread supply chain bottlenecks as well as labor short ages some participants commented that the recent global wave of covid infections and associated business shutdowns were exacerbating or prolonging these problems the supply chain bottlenecks were cre ating challenges for a number of manufacturers the problems were seen as especially acute for the motor ve hicle industry where the shortages of semiconductor chips had sharply curtailed production retail industries were also facing various bottlenecks including those stemming from port congestion and delays in ground transportation participants noted that their district contacts generally did not expect these bottlenecks to be fully resolved until sometime next year or even later a couple of participants noted that inventoriestosales ra tios were at or near recordlow levels in many industries and the need to rebuild them would boost business in vestment going forward participants also discussed the developments in oil gasoline and agricultural sectors a couple of participants pointed out that hurricane ida significantly affected the oil and gas industries curtailing us offshore production at a time of low inventories a couple of other participants noted that elevated crop prices were continuing to boost income in the agricul tural sector participants noted that labor market conditions had con tinued to improve in recent months the unemploy ment rate declined further to percent in august and a few participants noted a further pickup in recent months in the level of activity indicator in the federal reserve bank of kansas citys labor market conditions indicators after a rapid pace of almost million per month in june and july job gains slowed to in august as the resurgence of covid cases weighed on employment in highcontact service sectors particu larly in the leisure and hospitality sector meanwhile the labor force participation rate was little changed remain ing at a lower level than its prepandemic values some participants noted that the increase in labor force partic ipation that they had expected had not yet materialized in the wake of the reopening of schools and the expira tion of the extended unemployment benefits and that this likely reflected in part concerns about the resurgence of the virus childcare challenges and the uncertainties generated by ongoing disruptions to inperson school ing participants expected the labor market to continue to improve in coming months several participants in dicated that a rise in the labor force participation rate might lag the improvements in other indicators such as the unemployment ratea pattern consistent with past business cycle recoveries participants expressed a range minutes of the meeting of september page of views regarding the extent to which they expected the labor force participation rate and the epop ratio would move back to their prepandemic levels various partic ipants suggested that a complete return to prepandemic conditions was unlikely as the pandemic had prompted reductions in the workforce that were likely to persist including a large number of retirements and other depar tures from the labor force a number of others how ever assessed that once the covidrelated concerns that were currently weighing on labor force participation passed the participation rate and the epop ratio could return to or even exceed the prepandemic levels some participants remarked that the labor market recov ery continued to be uneven across demographic and in come groups and across sectors with the recovery being particularly slow for women with young children and people with lower incomes participants noted that their district contacts had broadly reported having difficulty hiring workers the labor shortages were causing firms to reduce hours and scale back production while also leading employers to provide incentives to attract and retain workers includ ing wage increases and signing and retention bonuses the rate of nominal wage growth had been robust in re cent data for example average hourly earnings were up percent at an annualized rate over the past six months in their discussion of inflation participants observed that the inflation rate was elevated and they expected that it would likely remain so in coming months before moderating participants marked up their inflation pro jections as they assessed that supply constraints in prod uct and labor markets were larger and likely to be longer lasting than previously anticipated some participants expressed concerns that elevated rates of inflation could feed through into longerterm inflation expectations of households and businesses or saw recent inflation data as suggestive of broader inflation pressures several other participants pointed out that the largest contribu tors to the recent elevated measures of inflation were a handful of covidrelated pandemicsensitive catego ries in which specific identifiable bottlenecks were at play this observation suggested that the upward pres sure on prices would abate as the covidrelated de mand and supply imbalances subsided these partici pants noted that prices in some of those categories showed signs of stabilizing or even turned down of late many participants pointed out that the owners equiva lent rent component of price indexes should be moni tored carefully as rising home prices could lead to up ward pressure on rents a few participants noted that there was not yet evidence that robust wage growth was exerting upward pressure on prices to a significant de gree but also that the possibility merited close monitor ing in their comments on inflation expectations several par ticipants observed that measures of longerterm infla tion expectations including tips and surveybased measures had remained in ranges that were viewed as broadly consistent with the committees longerrun in flation goal or that the distribution across households of longerterm expected inflation had remained stable over the past two years many participants noted the substantial rise in one and threeyear measures of infla tion expectations in the federal reserve bank of new yorks survey of consumer expectations or in the one year measure in the university of michigan surveys of consumers a few participants remarked that these sur vey measures tended to be sensitive to movements in ac tual inflation or that the recent rise was consistent with previous historical relationships between such measures and actual inflation in discussing the uncertainty and risks associated with the economic outlook participants noted that uncer tainty remained high a number of participants judged that the uncertain course of the virus supply chain dis ruptions and labor shortages complicated the task of in terpreting incoming economic data and assessing pro gress toward the committees goals participants gener ally saw the risks to the outlook for economic activity as broadly balanced uncertainty around the course of the virus the resolution of supply constraints and fiscal measures were cited as presenting both upside and downside risks in addition some participants men tioned the risks associated with high asset valuations in the united states and abroad and a number of partici pants commented on the importance of resolving the is sues involving the federal government budget and debt ceiling in a timely manner most participants saw infla tion risks as weighted to the upside because of concerns that supply disruptions and labor shortages might last longer and might have larger or more persistent effects on prices and wages than they currently assumed a few participants commented that there were also some downside risks for inflation as the factors that had held inflation down over the previous long expansion were likely still in place in their consideration of the stance of monetary policy participants reaffirmed the federal reserves commit ment to using its full range of tools to support the us page federal open market committee economy during this challenging time thereby promot ing the committees statutory goals of maximum em ployment and price stability participants judged that the current stance of monetary policy remained appropriate to promote maximum employment as well as to achieve inflation that averages percent over time and longer term inflation expectations that are well anchored at percent participants also reiterated that the existing outcomebased guidance implied that the paths of the federal funds rate and the balance sheet would depend on actual progress toward reaching the committees maximumemployment and inflation goals participants resumed their discussions on the progress made toward the committees goals since december when the committee adopted its guidance regard ing asset purchases and indicated that purchases would continue at their current pace until substantial further progress had been made toward the committees goals of maximum employment and price stability these pur chases had been a critical part of the federal reserves efforts to foster smooth financial market functioning and accommodative financial conditions thereby sup porting the flow of credit to households and businesses as well as the economic recovery most participants re marked that the standard of substantial further pro gress had been met with regard to the committees pricestability goal or that it was likely to be met soon with regard to the committees maximumemployment goal participants considered the cumulative degree of improvement in the labor market since december in doing so participants cited the progress recorded in a number of individual series including among others the employmenttopopulation ratio the unemployment rate claims for unemployment insurance job openings nominal wage growth and increases in payrolls as well as in summary measures of the labor situation some participants observed that progress on labor force par ticipation was lagging many participants noted that al though the economic recovery had slowed recently and the august increase in payrolls had fallen short of expec tations the labor market had continued to show im provement since the committees previous meeting a number of participants assessed that the standard of substantial further progress toward the goal of maxi mum employment had not yet been attained but that if the economy proceeded roughly as they anticipated it may soon be reached on the basis of the cumulative performance of the labor market since december a number of other participants indicated that they be lieved that the test of substantial further progress to ward maximum employment had been met some of these participants also suggested that labor supply con straints were the main impediments to further improve ment in labor market conditions rather than lack of de mand they noted that adding monetary policy accom modation at this time would not address such con straints or that the costs of continuing asset purchases might be beginning to exceed their benefits all partici pants agreed that it would be appropriate for the current meetings postmeeting statement to relay the commit tees judgment that if progress continued broadly as ex pected a moderation in the pace of asset purchases may soon be warranted participants also expressed their views on how slowing in the pace of purchases might proceed in particular participants commented on an illustrative path devel oped by the staff and reflecting participants discussions at the committees july meeting that gave the speed and composition associated with a tapering of asset pur chases the illustrative tapering path was designed to be simple to communicate and entailed a gradual reduction in the pace of net asset purchases that if begun later this year would lead the federal reserve to end purchases around the middle of next year the path featured monthly reductions in the pace of asset purchases by billion in the case of treasury securities and bil lion in the case of agency mortgagebacked securities mbs participants generally commented that the illus trative path provided a straightforward and appropriate template that policymakers might follow and a couple of participants observed that giving advance notice to the general public of a plan along these lines may reduce the risk of an adverse market reaction to a moderation in asset purchases participants noted that in keeping with the outcomebased standard for initiating a tapering of asset purchases the committee could adjust the pace of the moderation of its purchases if economic develop ments were to differ substantially from what they ex pected several participants indicated that they preferred to proceed with a more rapid moderation of purchases than described in the illustrative examples no decision to proceed with a moderation of asset pur chases was made at the meeting but participants gener ally assessed that provided that the economic recovery remained broadly on track a gradual tapering process that concluded around the middle of next year would likely be appropriate participants noted that if a deci sion to begin tapering purchases occurred at the next meeting the process of tapering could commence with the monthly purchase calendars beginning in either mid november or middecember minutes of the meeting of september page many participants remarked upon riskmanagement considerations and the way in which these figured into their thinking on asset purchases and the appropriate policy stance a number of downside risks to the eco nomic outlook were cited including a potential tighten ing of financial conditions the possibility that another rise in covid cases would slow the economic re covery by more than expected and the prospect that fis cal policy could become a source of economic head winds as the effects of previous support measures re ceded upside risks to the economic outlook included the possibility that there would be additional expansion ary fiscal actions or that consumer spending would rise by more than expected as households reduced the large volume of savings that they had accumulated during the pandemic with regard to inflation upside risks cited included the possibility that elevated levels of inflation would continue for longer than expected especially if la bor and other supply shortages proved more persistent than currently anticipated or that longerterm inflation expectations might move above levels consistent with the committees longerterm inflation objective of percent downside risks to inflation included the pos sibility of a decline in inflation expectations that might occur if the public misconstrued the federal reserves reaction function as less accommodative than it actually was several participants expressed concern that the high degree of accommodation being provided by mon etary policy including through continued asset pur chases could increase risks to financial stability participants reaffirmed that the committees substan tial further progress standard regarding its asset pur chases was distinct from the criteria given in its forward guidance on the federal funds rate and that a policy shift toward a moderation of asset purchases provided no di rect signal about its interest rate policy rather the committee had articulated a different and more strin gent test concerning the conditions that would need to be met before it started raising the target range for the federal funds rate various participants stressed that economic conditions were likely to justify keeping the rate at or near its lower bound over the next couple of years in addition to noting that the economy was still well below maximum employment several of these par ticipants suggested that there would likely be sustained downward pressure on inflation in the years ahead these participants stated that in such circumstances a major challenge facing policymakersespecially in the presence of the effective lower bound on the federal funds ratewas to maintain a policy stance sufficiently accommodative to keep average inflation at percent and thereby bolster the credibility of the committees new policy framework facilitating the achievement of both maximum employment and price stability in con trast a number of participants raised the possibility of beginning to increase the target range by the end of next year because they expected that the labor market and in flation outcomes specified in the committees guidance on the federal funds rate might be achieved by that time some of these participants saw inflation as likely to re main elevated in with risks to the upside committee policy action in their discussion of monetary policy for this meeting members agreed that with progress on vaccinations and strong policy support indicators of economic activity and employment had continued to strengthen they noted that the sectors most adversely affected by the pandemic had improved in recent months but that the rise in covid cases had slowed their recovery in flation was elevated largely reflecting transitory factors overall financial conditions remained accommodative in part reflecting policy measures to support the econ omy and the flow of credit to us households and busi nesses members also acknowledged that the path of the economy continued to depend on the course of the vi rus progress on vaccinations would likely continue to reduce the effects of the public health crisis on the econ omy but risks to the economic outlook remained members agreed that the federal reserve was commit ted to using its full range of tools to support the us economy in this challenging time thereby promoting its maximum employment and price stability goals all members reaffirmed that in accordance with the com mittees goals to achieve maximum employment and in flation at the rate of percent over the longer run and with inflation having run persistently below this longer run goal they would aim to achieve inflation moderately above percent for some time so that inflation averages percent over time and longerterm inflation expecta tions remain well anchored at percent members ex pected to maintain an accommodative stance of mone tary policy until those outcomes were achieved all members agreed to keep the target range for the fed eral funds rate at to percent and they expected that it would be appropriate to maintain this target range un til labor market conditions had reached levels consistent with the committees assessments of maximum employ ment and inflation had risen to percent and is on track to moderately exceed percent for some time last de cember the committee indicated that it would continue to increase its holdings of treasury securities by at least page federal open market committee billion per month and of agency mbs by at least billion per month until substantial further progress has been made toward its maximum employment and price stability goals the members commented that since then the economy had made progress toward these goals and that if progress continued broadly as ex pected a moderation in the pace of asset purchases may soon be warranted they judged that these asset pur chases would help foster smooth market functioning and accommodative financial conditions thereby sup porting the flow of credit to households and businesses members agreed that in assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy they would continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook and that they would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate in the event that risks emerged that could impede the attainment of the committees goals members also concurred that in assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy they would take into account a wide range of information in cluding readings on public health labor market condi tions inflation pressures and inflation expectations and financial and international developments members agreed that the postmeeting statement should acknowledge the slowing of the economic recovery as indicated in data received since the july meeting as well as ongoing elevated inflation readings in light of these developments they agreed that the committee should indicate that the sectors of the economy most adversely affected by the pandemic had improved in recent months but that the rise in covid cases had slowed their recovery and they also concurred that it would be appropriate to characterize inflation as being elevated in place of stating that inflation had risen members further decided to add to the postmeeting statement an indication that if progress toward the maximumemploy ment and pricestability goals continued broadly as ex pected the committee judged that a moderation in the pace of asset purchases may soon be warranted mem bers agreed that the addition of this language was an ap propriate means of acknowledging that in the near fu ture the committee would likely assess that the standard for reducing the pace of net asset purchases had been met with regard to the directive to the desk members agreed that the directive should incorporate the pro posed increase in the percounterparty limit for the on rrp facility to billion at the conclusion of the discussion the committee voted to authorize and direct the federal reserve bank of new york until instructed otherwise

and policy advisor federal reserve bank of cleveland karel mertens senior economic policy advisor federal reserve bank of dallas mark spiegel senior policy advisor federal reserve bank of san francisco brent meyer policy advisor and economist federal reserve bank of atlanta discussion of financial markets and open market operations the manager turned first to a discussion of global finan cial markets sovereign yields rose sharply across many advanced economies with much of the increase concen trated in measures of inflation compensation in the united states the fiveyear measure of inflation com pensation based on treasury inflation protected securi ties tips rose by around basis points far forward measures of inflation compensation also rose but by modest amounts in the open market desks surveys of primary dealers and market participants the median forecast for headline pce inflation in was revised up notably median forecasts beyond move up by less although the average of the probabilities reported by survey respondents placed on higher inflation out comes at these horizons increased modestly policy sensitive rates increased across most advanced economies the central banks of norway and new zea land raised their policy rates early in the period and pol icy communications from the bank of england and the bank of canada pointed to the potential for earlier pol icy firming than had been expected contributing to the upward movement of global rates the reserve bank of australia ended its yield target for the april gov ernment bond that central bank signaled that condi tions for raising the policy rate could be met in but were unlikely to be achieved in the earlier timeframe im plied by market pricing some european central bank communications also suggested that market rates were likely not consistent with the outlook for policy in the united states the marketimplied path of the fed eral funds rate rose implying an earlier date for raising the target range for the federal funds rate and a faster pace of rate hikes than was the case in september op tionimplied volatility on shortdated interest rates in creased reportedly reflecting greater uncertainty over page federal open market committee the path of the federal funds rate desk survey re sponses also indicated expectations for an earlier in crease in the target range although the median respond ents modal expectation shifted by less than market pric ing the median survey respondents modal expectation for the federal funds rate at the end of was little changed suggesting that investors had not revised their expectations for the cumulative extent of policy firming over the next four years expectations for a reduction in the pace of net asset purchases coalesced further and most survey respondents expected the tapering of asset purchases to start with the november purchase schedule with monthly reductions of billion and billion in treasury securities and agency mortgagebacked securi ties mbs respectively over the intermeeting period us equity indexes rose and the onemonth optionimplied volatility on the sp the vixfell to postpandemic lows con tinued strong earnings underpinned the rise in equity prices with firms posting profits near historical highs despite signs of robust risk appetite market participants continued to note prominent risks to the outlook in cluding ongoing challenges in the chinese property sec tor turning to desk operations the manager noted that should the committee decide to announce a reduction in the pace of net asset purchases at this meeting the desk would issue a monthly purchase schedule on no vember reflecting this change the middecember purchase schedule to be released just before the next fomc meeting would reflect additional reductions of the same size treasury securities and agency mbs would continue to be purchased across sectors and cou pons consistent with current practice if similar reductions in the net purchase pace were im plemented in subsequent months the system open market account soma portfolio would peak around next june at about trillion in terms of composition treasury securities and agency mbs would constitute roughly percent and percent of the soma port folio respectivelyroughly in line with the shares of treasury securities and agency mbs in the total stock of these securities outstandingand the soma portfolio would be more heavily weighted toward treasury secu rities than after the conclusion of the third largescale asset purchase program lsap following the global financial crisis the maturity composition of soma treasury coupon holdings would also be fairly close to that of the outstanding universe of treasury securities and the weighted average maturity would be shorter than after lsap turning to money market developments the manager noted that the transition away from libor london in terbank offered rate had gained momentum with a pickup in the interdealer trading volume of secured overnight financing rate sofr derivatives that said much remained to be done to complete the libor tran sition market participants were attentive to some tem porary downward pressure on the sofr over the pe riod this softness appeared to be the result of technical factors and was observed primarily in centrally cleared repurchase agreement markets the federal reserves administered ratesthe interest on reserve balances rate and the overnight reverse repurchase agreement on rrp ratecontinued to support effective interest rate control and outside of month and quarterend the fed eral funds rate remained stable over the period regarding the debt ceiling the shortterm resolution reached in october increased the debt limit by bil lion market participants estimates of the new date when the treasury would exhaust its extraordinary measures and cash balance were wideranging but some estimates suggested the date might be as early as mid december most market participants anticipated that a resolution to the debt ceiling would again be reached without a delayed payment on maturing treasury secu rities although uncertainty about the debt ceiling resolu tion remained a source of concern in financial markets by unanimous vote the committee ratified the desks domestic transactions over the intermeeting period there were no intervention operations in foreign curren cies for the systems account during the intermeeting pe riod staff review of the economic situation the information available at the time of the novem ber meeting suggested that us real gdp growth had slowed markedly in the third quarter after the first halfs rapid pace labor market conditions continued to improve in september though employment growth was slower than in recent months consumer price inflation in septemberas measured by the month percent age change in the pce price indexwas elevated growth in total nonfarm payroll employment slowed further in september held down by a decline in state and local government employment as of september total payroll employment had retraced threefourths of the losses seen at the onset of the pandemic the unem ployment rate declined from percent in august to minutes of the meeting of november page percent in september the unemployment rates for african americans and hispanics also declined over this period but both rates remained well above the national average the labor force participation rate edged lower in september and the employmenttopopulation ratio moved up privatesector job openings as measured by the job openings and labor turnover survey stepped down in august but remained well above prepandemic levels initial claims for regular state unemployment in surance moved lower through late october and were ap proaching the levels seen before the pandemic recent weekly estimates of privatesector payrolls constructed by the boards staff using data provided by the payroll processor adp were especially volatile but on balance appeared consistent with a pickup in the pace of private employment gains relative to september the employ ment cost index of hourly compensation in the private sector rose percent over the months ending in september this gain was noticeably larger than the in dexs yearearlier month change and was the fastest month change since total pce price inflation was percent over the months ending in september and core pce price in flation which excludes changes in consumer energy prices and many consumer food prices was percent over the same period the trimmed mean measure of month pce inflation constructed by the federal re serve bank of dallas was percent in september in the third quarter of the staffs common inflation expectations index which combines information from many indicators of inflation expectations and inflation compensation was little changed relative to the second quarter and remained at its highest level since real pce posted a modest increase in the third quarter after having risen sharply over the first half of the year the thirdquarter slowdown appeared to reflect a com bination of factors including the waning effect of previ ous fiscal stimulus measures the surge in covid cases over the summer and a plunge in motor vehicle purchases as extremely low dealer inventories con strained sales residential investment dropped further in the third quarter although demand for housing was strong shortages of construction supplies as well as tight land and labor markets restrained residential construc tion activity growth in business fixed investment slowed sharply in the third quarter as supply bottlenecksparticularly for motor vehiclesweighed on business equipment spending and a limited availability of construction mate rials held back spending on nonresidential structures manufacturing output declined in september motor ve hicle output stepped down further as semiconductor shortages continued to restrain production in addition hurricane ida resulted in prolonged plant outages in the petrochemical refining and plastic resins industries total real government purchases posted a small increase in the third quarter after having declined in the second quarter although real state and local purchases in creased the gain was largely offset by declines in both federal defense and nondefense purchases the us international trade deficit widened in august reflecting a moderate pace of import growth against a subdued pace of export growth real import growth was driven by increases in consumer goods and industrial supplies real export growth was held back by declines in capital goods agricultural products and automotive products bottlenecks in the global semiconductor in dustry continued to weigh on exports and imports of au tomotive products and shipping congestion continued to restrain trade overall advance estimates for septem ber suggested that goods imports rose while goods ex ports fell pointing to a further widening of the trade def icit the bureau of economic analysis estimated that a drop in net exports subtracted substantially from real gdp growth in the third quarter foreign gdp growth slowed modestly in the third quar ter as supply chain disruptions and the resurgence of covid weighed on production particularly in china and other emerging market economies emes in several emes public health restrictions were rein stated resulting in factory closures moreover chinese manufacturing output was curtailed by the rationing of electricity amid a coal shortage resulting in part from policies to lower carbon emissions in contrast to emes advanced foreign economies afes generally continued to recover at a solid pace in the third quarter as the boost from the further reopening of highcontact services activity was only partially offset by the drag from bottlenecks the spread of the virus and in some places labor shortages twelvemonth rates of inflation abroad continued to rise reflecting further increases in energy prices persistent pressures from supply bottle necks and past exchange rate depreciation in some emes staff review of the financial

federal funds rate over the next few yearsimplied by a straight read of overnight index swap quotesrose sub stantially since the september fomc meeting appar ently in response to perceived risks of higher inflation those risks also contributed to increases in treasury yields with and year yields rising notably on net broad equity indexes increased on net over the inter meeting period perceptions of increased risks related to inflation were more than offset by a shortterm resolu tion of the debt ceiling a decrease in perceived risks re lated to the effect of the pandemic on the pace of the economic recovery and strongerthanexpected third quarter earnings the vix declined notably to near pre pandemic levels spreads on corporate bonds were little changed on net over the intermeeting period and re mained at low levels spreads of municipal bonds nar rowed slightly shortterm funding markets were stable over the inter meeting period the effective federal funds rate re mained at basis points throughout the period except on monthends while the sofr averaged basis points consistent with relatively low treasury bill supply and abundant liquidity participation in on rrp operations increased from an average of trillion over the previ ous intermeeting period to trillion reaching a new high of trillion on the september quarterend in major foreign markets sovereign yields rose notably over the intermeeting period as did inflation compensa tion and marketimplied measures of expected policy rates amid sharp further increases in energy prices con cerns about higher inflation and communications by some foreign central banks that were seen as signaling a faster removal of monetary policy accommodation market concerns about risks of a downturn in the chi nese real estate sector remained elevated and inflows into funds investing in china slowed but the effects on broader financial markets were limited on balance ma jor foreign equity indexes increased moderately and the broad dollar appreciated a touch in domestic credit markets financing conditions faced by nonfinancial firms in capital markets remained highly accommodative over the intermeeting period gross corporate bond issuance stayed strong in september and october gross leveraged loan issuance decreased slightly in september after its strong growth in august equity raised through traditional initial public offerings remained robust in september and october while equity issuance through special purpose acquisition companies remained at the subdued levels seen in recent months commercial and industrial ci loans declined notably in the third quarter amid ongoing forgiveness of paycheck protection program loans in the october senior loan officer opinion survey on bank lending practices sloos banks reported easing standards and terms on net for ci loans over the third quarter banks also reported that demand for ci loans was about unchanged over the third quarter after strength ening for the previous two quarters on balance loan de mand was still weaker than before the pandemic the credit quality of large nonfinancial corporations re mained strong the volume of credit rating upgrades for speculativegrade nonfinancial corporate bonds out paced downgrades in september and october trailing default rates on corporate bonds and leveraged loans de creased from already low levels while market indicators of future expected default rates remained benign in the municipal bond market financing conditions re mained accommodative despite a modest increase in yields issuance of municipal debt was strong in sep tember and october and indicators of the credit quality of municipal debt remained healthy surveybased indicators suggested that small business owners became less pessimistic about their financial pro spects with the exception of owners in the educational services sector for whom expectations deteriorated slightly while loan originations to small businesses fell a bit the results from the october sloos suggested that the decline appeared to reflect weak demand par ticularly for small and very small firms commercial real estate loan balances on banks books strengthened and in the october sloos banks re ported an easing of standards on such loans over the third quarter issuance of commercial mortgagebacked securities cmbs remained robust supported by spreads of agency cmbs generally at or below prepan demic levels delinquency rates on mortgages in cmbs pools continued to fall but remained elevated for cmbs backed by hotel and retail properties minutes of the meeting of november page in the residential mortgage market financing conditions remained accommodative particularly for borrowers who met standard conforming loan criteria in the oc tober sloos banks reported easing lending standards for almost all major mortgage categories mortgage rates increased modestly over the intermeeting period but did not rise as much as the year treasury yield indica tors of mortgage originations for home purchases and refinancing remained fairly robust the share of mort gages in forbearance continued to decline through oc tober and the rate of new transitions into delinquency stayed low by historical standards financing conditions for consumer credit remained ac commodative for most borrowers especially those with stronger credit scores lending standards for nonprime consumers in the credit card market continued to ease but remained slightly tighter than prepandemic levels in the october sloos banks reported easier standards for credit cards and auto loans over the third quarter while demand for credit cards strengthened auto loan growth slowed in response to low dealer inventories and a weakening of auto sales the staff provided an update on indicators related to the stability of the financial system the staff noted that as set valuations remained generally high relative to histor ical norms in particular bond and leveraged loan spreads remained narrow while equity prices continued to increase supported by strong earnings expectations stilllow treasury yields and high risk appetite house prices rose rapidly outpacing rents but the staff did not see signs of loose mortgage underwriting standards or excessive mortgage credit growth that could potentially amplify a shock arising from falling house prices for households the level of consumer debt was largely un changed on an inflationadjusted basis while delinquen cies returned to prepandemic levels or below for non financial businesses measures of leverage in the corpo rate sector fell over the second quarter and largely re turned to prepandemic levels in addition the level of corporate debt became more sustainable as earnings in creased and rates remained low in the financial sector the staff noted that banks were strongly capitalized with high levels of stable funding and highquality liquid as sets the mean level of gross hedge fund leverage was noteworthy and its distribution was skewed with partic ularly high leverage among funds in the top decile vul nerabilities associated with funding risks remained at money funds and other mutual funds in addition fund ing risks were an emerging concern at entities issuing sta blecoins because they appeared to have structural ma turity and liquidity transformation vulnerabilities similar to those for money funds but with considerably less transparency and an underdeveloped regulatory frame work the staff noted that the presidents working group on financial markets was engaged in interagency work to address these risks staff economic outlook the projection for us economic activity prepared by the staff for the november fomc meeting was slightly weaker than the september projection incoming data suggested that the resolution of supply constraints was starting later and would be more gradual than previously assumed even so real gdp was expected to post a siz able gain over as a whole in real gdp growth was expected to remain close to its pace supported by the continued reopening of the economy and the resolution of supply constraints in most sectors with the boost from these factors fading real gdp growth was projected to step down noticeably in and to be close to potential output growth in and however the level of real gdp was expected to remain well above potential throughout the projection period and the unemployment rate was expected to de cline to historically low levels the staffs nearterm outlook for inflation was revised up as consumer food and energy prices had risen faster than expected and production bottlenecks and recent wage gains were seen as putting somewhat greater up ward pressure on prices than had been anticipated as a result the month change in pce prices was projected to move up further relative to septembers pace and to end the year well above percent over the following two years the boost to consumer prices caused by sup ply issues was expected to partly reverse and resource utilization was projected to tighten further pce price inflation was therefore expected to step down to per cent in and to percent in before edging back up to percent in the staff continued to judge that the risks to the baseline projection for economic activity were skewed to the downside and that the risks around the inflation projec tion were skewed to the upside in particular the possi bility of another sizable wave of covid cases in the winter was seen as an important source of downside risk to activity while the possibility of more severe and per sistent supply issues was viewed as an additional down side risk to activity and as an upside risk to inflation participants views on current economic condi tions and the economic outlook in their discussion of current conditions participants noted that with progress on vaccinations and strong page federal open market committee policy support indicators of economic activity and em ployment had continued to strengthen the sectors most adversely affected by the pandemic had improved in recent months but the summers rise in covid cases had slowed their recovery inflation was elevated largely reflecting factors that were expected to be transi tory supply and demand imbalances related to the pan demic and the reopening of the economy had contrib uted to sizable price increases in some sectors overall financial conditions remained accommodative in part reflecting policy measures to support the economy and the flow of credit to us households and businesses participants noted that the path of the economy contin ued to depend on the course of the virus progress on vaccinations and an easing of supply constraints were ex pected to support continued gains in economic activity and employment as well as a reduction in inflation but risks to the economic outlook remained participants observed that growth in economic activity had slowed in the third quarter to a rate significantly be low the robust pace seen in the first half of the year the spread of the delta variant had contributed to the slow down in growth in the third quarter by damping house hold and business spending holding down labor supply and intensifying supply chain disruptions participants noted that the underlying conditions supporting growth in demand remained strong and that as the number of covid cases remained well below the summers lev els growth in economic activity would likely show a pickup in the fourth quarter they further foresaw ro bust growth in supported by progress on vaccina tions and an easing of supply constraints in their discussion of the household sector participants remarked that demand for most consumer goods had re mained strong they noted that businesses had generally recorded robust sales despite labor shortages and other supply disruptions that had prevented them from fully meeting higher demand for their products participants interpreted available data as suggesting that the spread of the delta variant had slowed the shift of consumer demand toward purchases of services and away from spending on goods stretching out the full reopening of the economy and intensifying supply and demand imbal ances participants observed that households had strong balance sheets and that consumer spending would also be supported by accommodative financial conditions a number of participants noted that there was likely to be a drag on household spending as previous fiscal support faded or that fiscal policy might provide some support to aggregate demand if the congress authorized major new federal appropriations participants remarked that supply chain challenges and limited labor availability continued to be major con straints on manufacturing activity and the business sec tor more broadly bottleneck pressures faced by busi nesses were accompanied by global supply chain disrup tions associated with major backlogs in shipments and transportation as well as surging demand for a variety of goods shortages of labor and other inputs increases in costs of production and depleted inventory levels in key sectors many business contacts had experienced a worsening of supply chain problems and participants re ported that firms had responded to these challenges by taking a variety of actions including raising prices turn ing away customers restructuring supply chains and us ing alternative but highercost shipping options par ticipants judged that supply constraints would likely con tinue for longer than they had previously expected participants noted that data received over the intermeet ing period indicated that labor market conditions had continued to improve although the september increase in payrolls had been moderate compared with recent months the unemployment rate had declined further and previous months job growth had been revised up participants observed that septembers rise in payrolls had been held down by a shortage of workers in part reflecting the ongoing effect of the virus on labor supply decisions with covid cases expected to remain below the summers levels participants anticipated bet ter payroll numbers in the months ahead participants indicated that district contacts continued to report dif ficulties in finding and retaining workers and that in ad dition to offering higher wages businesses were turning to increased use of automation while recognizing that labor market conditions varied significantly across the country some participants cited a number of signs that the us labor market was very tight these included data on quits job availability and stronger rates of nominal wage growth reflected in the recent rise in the employment cost index as well as the readings provided by the federal reserve bank of kan sas citys labor market conditions indicators a num ber of participants observed that the labor force partici pation rate remained well below the level reached before the pandemic several participants judged that labor force participation would be structurally lower than in the past and a few of these participants cited the high level of retirements recorded since the start of the pan demic several other participants suggested that labor supply was currently being depressed by pandemicre lated factors such as disruptions related to caregiving ar minutes of the meeting of november page rangements and noted that the importance of such fac tors would likely diminish as economic and public health conditions improved further participants generally saw the current elevated level of inflation as largely reflecting factors that were likely to be transitory but judged that inflation pressures could take longer to subside than they had previously assessed they remarked that the delta wave had intensified the impediments to supply chains and had helped sustain the high level of goods demand adding to the upward pres sure on prices participants also observed that increases in energy prices stronger rates of nominal wage growth and higher housing rental costs had been forces adding to inflation some participants highlighted the fact that price increases had become more widespread although participants expected significant inflation pressures to last for longer than they previously expected they gen erally continued to anticipate that the inflation rate would diminish significantly during as supply and demand imbalances abated nonetheless they indicated that their uncertainty regarding this assessment had in creased many participants pointed to considerations that might suggest that elevated inflation could prove more persistent these participants noted that average inflation already exceeded percent when measured on a multiyear basis and cited a number of factorssuch as businesses enhanced scope to pass on higher costs to their customers the possibility that nominal wage growth had become more sensitive to labor market pres sures or accommodative financial conditionsthat might result in inflation continuing at elevated levels some other participants however remarked that al though inflationary pressures were lasting longer than anticipated those pressures continued to reflect the same pandemicrelated imbalances and would likely abate when supply constraints eased these participants also noted that the most sizable price increases may have already occurred that there was as yet little evidence of a change in inflation dynamicssuch as the develop ment of a wageprice spiralthat would tend to pro long elevated levels of inflation and that forces already in motion would likely bring inflation down toward percent over the medium term participants were at tentive to the sizable increase in the cost of living that had taken place this year and the associated burden on us households particularly those who had limited scope to pay higher prices for essential goods and ser vices in their comments on inflation expectations a number of participants discussed the risk that in light of recent elevated levels of inflation the publics longerterm ex pectations of inflation might increase to a level above that consistent with the committees longerrun infla tion objective such a development could make it harder for the committee to achieve percent inflation over the longer run a couple of participants pointed to in creases in survey and marketbased indicators of ex pected inflationincluding the notable rise in the five year tipsbased measure of inflation compensationas possible signs that inflation expectations were becoming less well anchored several other participants however remarked that measures of near and mediumterm in flation expectations typically had been sensitive to movements in realized inflation and that they had not exhibited greater sensitivity recently they additionally pointed out that indicators of longerterm inflation ex pectationsincluding the fiveyear fiveyearforward measure of inflation compensationcontinued to dis play less sensitivity to realized inflation and remained well anchored at levels consistent with the committees longerrun percent goal participants observed that uncertainty about the eco nomic outlook remained high they particularly stressed uncertainties associated with the labor market including the evolution of labor force participation and with the length of time required to resolve the supply chain situ ation participants cited upside risks to inflation includ ing those associated with strong demand for goods and a tight labor market upside risks to economic activity included a potential nearterm boost to aggregate de mand that could arise from the drawing down of the substantial savings accumulated by households since the beginning of the pandemic a few participants men tioned an upsurge in covid cases during the com ing winter or an emergence of new virus strains as pos sibilities that if they were realized would damp eco nomic activity and intensify price pressures a number of participants commented on issues related to financial stability a couple of participants noted fac tors supporting the strength and resilience of the us fi nancial system including the solid capital and liquidity conditions of banks and the fact that underwriting stand ards for residential mortgages had not eased substantially in an environment of rising house prices a few partici pants emphasized the importance of maintaining strong bank capital positions particularly at the largest banks a few participants also cited a number of factors repre senting potential vulnerabilities to the financial system these included elevated asset valuations prevailing widely across asset classes the growing exposure of page federal open market committee banks to nonbank financial firms and the risk of a sud den reduction in the liquidity of collateral used at central counterparty clearing and settlement systems in the area of cybersecurity a few participants stressed the im portance of greater preparedness against a cyberattack that could disrupt the nations payments process and fi nancial system several participants commented on the financial stability risksincluding those relating to ma turity and liquidity transformationassociated with sta blecoins and on the need for regulators to address these risks a few participants noted the importance of devel oping systematic monitoring of the climaterelated risks facing the financial system in their consideration of the stance of monetary policy participants agreed that the economy had made substan tial further progress toward the committees goals since december when the committee adopted its guid ance regarding asset purchases the unemployment rate had declined to percent in septemberabout per centage points lower than the level last decemberand job openings and other indicators also were pointing to widespread strength in labor demand consistent with a broad improvement in labor market conditions conse quently participants assessed that the criterion of sub stantial further progress had been met with regard to the committees maximum employment goal in addition participants generally judged that the committees crite rion of substantial further progress had clearly been more than met with respect to inflation against this backdrop all participants judged that consistent with the committees previous policy communications it would be appropriate to announce at this meeting a re duction in the pace of net asset purchases participants generally supported the plan to implement reductions in the pace of net purchases of treasury securities and agency mbs by billion and billion per month re spectively over the upcoming intermeeting period and judged that similar reductions in the pace would likely be appropriate in each subsequent month some partici pants preferred a somewhat faster pace of reductions that would result in an earlier conclusion to net pur chases participants noted that beginning to scale back the pace of net asset purchases was not intended to con vey any direct signal regarding adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate they highlighted the more stringent criteria for raising the target range com pared with the criteria that applied to beginning to re duce the pace of asset purchases participants stressed that maintaining flexibility to imple ment appropriate policy adjustments on the basis of risk management considerations should be a guiding princi ple in conducting policy in the current highly uncertain environment some participants suggested that reducing the pace of net asset purchases by more than billion each month could be warranted so that the committee would be in a better position to make adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate particularly in light of inflation pressures various participants noted that the committee should be prepared to adjust the pace of asset purchases and raise the target range for the federal funds rate sooner than participants currently anticipated if inflation continued to run higher than levels consistent with the committees objectives at the same time be cause of the continuing considerable uncertainty about developments in supply chains production logistics and the course of the virus a number of participants stressed that a patient attitude toward incoming data remained appropriate to allow for careful evaluation of evolving supply chain developments and their implications for the labor market and inflation that said participants noted that the committee would not hesitate to take appropri ate actions to address inflation pressures that posed risks to its longerrun price stability and employment objec tives committee policy action in their discussion of monetary policy for this meeting members agreed that with progress on vaccinations and strong policy support indicators of economic activity and employment had continued to strengthen they noted that the sectors most adversely affected by the pandemic had improved in recent months but that the summers rise in covid cases had slowed their re covery inflation was elevated largely reflecting factors that were expected to be transitory they remarked that supply and demand imbalances related to the pandemic and the reopening of the economy had contributed to sizable price increases in some sectors overall financial conditions remained accommodative in part reflecting policy measures to support the economy and the flow of credit to us households and businesses members also acknowledged that the path of the economy continued to depend on the course of the virus progress on vac cinations and an easing of supply constraints were ex pected to support continued gains in economic activity and employment as well as a reduction in inflation but risks to the economic outlook remained members agreed that the postmeeting statement should acknowledge that the sectors of the economy most ad versely affected by the pandemic had improved in recent months but that the summers rise in covid cases had slowed their recovery they also concurred that it minutes of the meeting of november page would be appropriate to convey less certainty about the path of inflation by noting that the factors driving ele vated inflation are expected to be transitory in order to provide additional information about these factors members further decided that the postmeeting state ment would say that supply and demand imbalances re lated to the pandemic and the reopening of the economy have contributed to sizable price increases in some sec tors members also agreed to include a sentence stating that progress on vaccinations and an easing of supply constraints are expected to support continued gains in economic activity and employment as well as a reduction in inflation members agreed that the federal reserve was commit ted to using its full range of tools to support the us economy in this challenging time thereby promoting its maximum employment and price stability goals all members reaffirmed that in accordance with the com mittees goals to achieve maximum employment and in flation at the rate of percent over the longer run and with inflation having run persistently below this longer run goal they would aim to achieve inflation moderately above percent for some time so that inflation averages percent over time and longerterm inflation expecta tions remain well anchored at percent members ex pected to maintain an accommodative stance of mone tary policy until those outcomes were achieved in their discussion of monetary policy in the period ahead members agreed that in light of the substantial further progress the economy had made toward the committees goals since last december the committee should begin to slow the pace of its asset purchases at this meeting consistent with this approach the com mittee decided to start reducing the monthly pace of its net asset purchases by billion for treasury securities and billion for agency mbs consequently the com mittee agreed that beginning with the purchase schedule published in midnovember it would increase its hold ings of treasury securities by at least billion per month rather than billion per month and would in crease its holdings of agency mbs by at least billion per month rather than billion per month because the open market desk would be releasing two monthly purchase schedules between the november and december fomc meetings the committee further de cided to add to the postmeeting statement an indication that beginning in december the committee would in crease its holdings of treasury securities by at least billion per month and of agency mbs by at least billion per month members decided the postmeeting statement should state that the committee judged that similar reductions in the pace of net asset purchases would likely be appro priate in subsequent months implying that increases in securities holdings would cease by the middle of next year under the committees outlook members also noted that the committee was prepared to adjust the pace of purchases if warranted by changes in the eco nomic outlook and agreed that the postmeeting state ment should say so members agreed that the addition of this language would acknowledge the importance of maintaining flexibility to adjust the stance of policy as appropriate in response to changes in the committees outlook for the labor market and inflation members agreed that the statement should continue to note that the committees ongoing asset purchases helped foster smooth market functioning and accommodative finan cial conditions additionally members decided to intro duce into the postmeeting statement a reference to the federal reserves holdings of securities in the sen tence describing the economic effects of asset purchases this addition would make clear that even after net in creases in the soma portfolio ceased the federal re serves elevated securities holdings would continue to support accommodative financial conditions members agreed that in assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy they would continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook and that they would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate in the event that risks emerged that could impede the attainment of the committees goals they also concurred that in as sessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy they would take into account a wide range of information in cluding readings on public health labor market condi tions inflation pressures and inflation expectations and financial and international developments at the conclusion of the discussion the committee voted to authorize and direct the federal reserve bank of new york until instructed otherwise to execute transactions in the soma in accordance with the fol lowing domestic policy directive for release at pm effective november the federal open market

committee will aim to achieve inflation moder ately above percent for some time so that in flation averages percent over time and longer term inflation expectations remain well an chored at percent the committee expects to maintain an accommodative stance of monetary policy until these outcomes are achieved the committee decided to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at to percent and ex pects it will be appropriate to maintain this tar get range until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the committees assessments of maximum employment and in flation has risen to percent and is on track to moderately exceed percent for some time in light of the substantial further progress the economy has made toward the committees goals since last december the committee de cided to begin reducing the monthly pace of its net asset purchases by billion for treasury securities and billion for agency mortgage backed securities beginning later this month the

beginning in december the committee will increase its holdings of treasury securities by at least billion per month and of agency mortgage backed securities by at least billion per month the committee judges that similar re ductions in the pace of net asset purchases will likely be appropriate each month but it is pre pared to adjust the pace of purchases if war ranted by changes in the economic

york new york and new york respectively robert lerman and jamie pfeifer assistant vice presidents federal reserve bank of new york linsey molloy quantitative policy and analysis manager federal reserve bank of new york developments in financial markets and open market operations the manager turned first to a discussion of financial market developments over the period financial mar kets responded to significant new information about the economy and monetary policy as well as the emergence of the omicron variant overall domestic financial con ditions tightened modestly but remained near historically accommodative levels expectations for an earlier re duction in federal reserve policy accommodation lifted shortterm interest rates and supported the dollar while prices of equities that are sensitive to covid risks declined significantly the sp index was little changed over the period market participants considered poten tial drivers of the notable decline in farforward sover eign yields in the united states and other advanced econ omies news of the omicron variant reportedly drove safehaven flows into sovereign bonds pushing term premiums lower the significant comovement between farforward yields and the share prices of firms most af fected by social distancing was consistent with this inter pretation in addition to the effects of the pandemic on risk sentiment some discussed the potential for covid to become endemic possibly resulting in modestly lower potential growth over time and a lower longrun neutral level of the federal funds rate regarding the outlook for us monetary policy expec tations for a reduction in policy accommodation shifted forward notably respondents to the open market page federal open market committee desks surveys of primary dealers and market partici pants broadly projected that the committee would quicken the pace of reduction in the federal reserves net purchases of treasury securities and agency mortgagebacked securities mbs and the median re spondent projected net asset purchases to end in march the median respondents projected timing for the first increase in the target range for the federal funds rate also moved earlier from the first quarter of to june although the desk surveys and interest rate futures in dicated expectations for earlier increases in the target range than at the time of the november meeting expec tations for the federal funds rate at longer horizons did not appear to have risen in addition the average of probability distributions for the federal funds rate re ported in the desk surveys suggested considerable un certainty about the path of the federal funds rate as sur vey respondents placed significant odds on a range of outcomes with the likely timing of the beginning of the removal of policy accommodation considered closer market participants began to discuss how balance sheet policy might feature in the committees plan for reduc ing accommodation when warranted although expecta tions for the timing of the first decline in the balance sheet were diffuse the manager turned next to a discussion of foreign de velopments foreign policysensitive rates were rela tively steady over the intermeeting period as several cen tral banks in advanced foreign economies afes sig naled somewhat cautious approaches to the removal of policy accommodation market participants continued to focus on risks related to economic and financial de velopments in china though nearterm concerns had moderated some following steps by chinese authorities to ease policy turning to desk operations and money markets the manager noted that the desk had reduced net purchases of treasury securities and agency mbs in accordance with the directive issued at the november meeting overall the transition to a slower pace of purchases had gone smoothly in money markets news that a path had emerged to a resolution of the debt ceiling impasse led yields on treasury bills maturing in december and jan uary to decline following the resolution the treasury was expected to increase bill issuance to restore the treasury general account to more normal levels mar ket participants generally were not anticipating signifi cant strains in money market conditions over year end in discussing recently established backstop facilities the manager noted continued progress towards expanding access to the standing repurchase agreement repo fa cility srf to depository institutions a number of insti tutions were currently in the process of becoming srf counterparties the federal reserve also continued to onboard new counterparties for the foreign and inter national monetary authorities repo facility and cus tomers to the facility now represented the majority of foreign and international monetary authorities custody holdings of treasury securities at the federal reserve bank of new york the temporary dollar liquidity swap lines established in march were set to expire on december the committees foreign currency di rective would be updated at the january meeting to re flect the expiration of those lines finally the manager provided an update on the transi tion away from libor london interbank offered rate overall considerable progress had been made in the transition away from libor to the secured overnight financing rate sofr in cash and derivatives markets however a few key areas of work remained by unanimous vote the committee ratified the desks domestic transactions over the intermeeting period there were no intervention operations in foreign curren cies for the systems account during the intermeeting pe riod discussion of policy normalization considerations participants began a discussion of a range of topics as sociated with the eventual normalization of the stance of monetary policy the topics included the lessons learned from the committees previous experience with policy normalization alternative approaches for remov ing policy accommodation the timing and sequencing of policy normalization actions and the appropriate size and composition of the federal reserves balance sheet in the longer run they agreed that their discussion at this meeting would be helpful background for the com mittees future decisions regarding policy normalization no decisions regarding the committees approach were made at the meeting the participants discussion was preceded by staff presentations the staff reviewed the previous normali zation episode including how the committee com menced normalization by raising the target range for the federal funds rate and then reducing the federal re serves asset holdings in a gradual and predictable man ner as well as the timing of these steps the staff then discussed some of the channels through which policy rate and balance sheet actions affect financial conditions minutes of the meeting of december page and alternative ways these tools could be deployed to re duce policy accommodation in support of the commit tees macroeconomic goals the staff presentation in cluded assessments of the implications for the yield curve of alternative settings of the two tools the relative uncertainty of the effects of each tool and the challenges associated with conducting and communicating policy with multiple tools finally the staff reviewed the expe rience of foreign central banks with policy normaliza tion participants judged that several aspects of the previous approach remained applicable in the current environ ment in particular they noted that the principles and plans underlying policy normalization were communi cated in advance of any decisions or actions which en hanced the publics understanding and thus the effec tiveness of monetary policy during that period at the same time participants remarked that the previous ex perience highlighted the benefits of maintaining the flex ibility to adjust the details of the approach to normaliza tion in response to economic and financial develop ments participants generally emphasized that as in the previous normalization episode and as expressed in the committees statement on longerrun goals and mon etary policy strategy changes in the target range for the federal funds rate should be the committees primary means for adjusting the stance of monetary policy in support of its maximumemployment and pricestability objectives this preference reflected the view that there is less uncertainty about the effects of changes in the fed eral funds rate on the economy than about the effects of changes in the federal reserves balance sheet moreo ver participants stated that the federal funds rate is a more familiar tool to the general public and therefore is advantageous for communication purposes a few par ticipants also noted that when the federal funds rate is away from the effective lower bound elb the com mittee could more nimbly change interest rate policy than balance sheet policy in response to economic con ditions participants also discussed some key differences be tween current economic conditions and those that pre vailed during the previous episode and remarked that the committee would have to take these differences into ac count in removing policy accommodation most nota bly participants remarked that the current economic outlook was much stronger with higher inflation and a tighter labor market than at the beginning of the previ ous normalization episode they also observed that the federal reserves balance sheet was much larger both in dollar terms and relative to nominal gross domestic product gdp than it was at the end of the third large scale asset purchase program in late participants noted that the current weighted average maturity of the federal reserves treasury holdings was shorter than at the beginning of the previous normalization episode some observed that as a result depending on the size of any caps put on the pace of runoff the balance sheet could potentially shrink faster than last time if the com mittee followed its previous approach in phasing out the reinvestment of maturing treasury securities and princi pal payments on agency mbs however several partic ipants raised concerns about vulnerabilities in the treas ury market and how those vulnerabilities could affect the appropriate pace of balance sheet normalization a cou ple of participants noted that the srf could help to mit igate such concerns participants also judged the federal reserve to be better positioned for normalization than in the past as the amplereserves framework and the federal reserves current interest rate control tools in cluding interest on reserve balances and the overnight reverse repurchase agreement on rrp facility are in place and working well some participants judged that a significant amount of balance sheet shrinkage could be appropriate over the normalization process especially in light of abundant liquidity in money markets and ele vated usage of the on rrp facility participants had an initial discussion about the appropri ate conditions and timing for starting balance sheet run off relative to raising the federal funds rate from the elb they also discussed how this relative timing might differ from the previous experience in which balance sheet runoff commenced almost two years after policy rate liftoff when the normalization of the federal funds rate was judged to be well under way almost all partic ipants agreed that it would likely be appropriate to initi ate balance sheet runoff at some point after the first in crease in the target range for the federal funds rate however participants judged that the appropriate tim ing of balance sheet runoff would likely be closer to that of policy rate liftoff than in the committees previous experience they noted that current conditions included a stronger economic outlook higher inflation and a larger balance sheet and thus could warrant a potentially faster pace of policy rate normalization they empha sized that the decision to initiate runoff would be data dependent some participants commented that removing policy ac commodation by relying more on balance sheet reduc tion and less on increases in the policy rate could help limit yield curve flattening during policy normalization page federal open market committee a few of these participants raised concerns that a rela tively flat yield curve could adversely affect interest mar gins for some financial intermediaries which may raise financial stability risks however a couple of other par ticipants referenced staff analysis and previous experi ence in noting that many factors can affect longerdated yields making it difficult to judge how a different policy mix would affect the shape of the yield curve many participants judged that the appropriate pace of balance sheet runoff would likely be faster than it was during the previous normalization episode many par ticipants also judged that monthly caps on the runoff of securities could help ensure that the pace of runoff would be measured and predictable particularly given the shorter weighted average maturity of the federal re serves treasury security holdings participants discussed considerations regarding the longerrun size of the balance sheet consistent with the efficient and effective implementation of monetary pol icy in an amplereserves regime participants noted that the current size of the balance sheet is elevated and would likely remain so for some time after the process of normalizing the balance sheet was under way several participants noted that the level of reserves that would ultimately be needed to implement monetary policy ef fectively is uncertain because the underlying demand for reserves by banks is time varying in light of this uncer tainty and the committees previous experience a cou ple of participants expressed a preference to allow for a substantial buffer level of reserves to support interest rate control participants noted that it would be im portant to carefully monitor developments in money markets as the level of reserves fell to help inform the committees eventual assessment of the appropriate level for the balance sheet in the longer run some par ticipants expressed the view that the srf would help en sure interest rate control as the size of the balance sheet approached its longerrun level several participants noted that the srf could facilitate a faster runoff of the balance sheet than might otherwise be the case several participants raised the possibility that the establishment of the srf could reduce the demand for reserves in the longer run suggesting that the longerrun balance sheet could be smaller than otherwise participants also discussed the composition of the fed eral reserves asset holdings consistent with the previ ous normalization principles some participants ex pressed a preference for the federal reserves asset holdings to consist primarily of treasury securities in the longer run to achieve such a composition some par ticipants favored reinvesting principal from agency mbs into treasury securities relatively soon or letting agency mbs run off the balance sheet faster than treasury se curities participants welcomed additional analysis from the staff on issues related to normalization and agreed that con tinuing their deliberations at upcoming meetings would be useful staff review of the economic situation the information available at the time of the decem ber meeting suggested that us real gdp growth was picking up in the fourth

retail goods rose solidly again in october and outlays for ser vices strengthened in november however the com ponents of the nominal retail sales data used to estimate pce stepped down possibly reflecting some holiday sales having been pulled forward to october light mo tor vehicle sales in october and november were below their thirdquarter average though they were up on net relative to september as extremely low dealer invento ries continued to constrain sales housing demand re mained strong but indicators of housingsector activity including housing starts and home sales were generally little changed in october shortages of construction ma terials appeared to have hampered building completions and there was limited availability of lots ready for con struction growth in business fixed investment appeared to be ris ing at a slow pace again in the fourth quarter as supply bottlenecks continued to weigh on business equipment spending and the limited availability of

gain in november motor vehicle output moved up in october from its low level in september as most assembly plants previously shuttered by semiconductor chip shortages had reopened outside of motor

was broad based with sizable increases in real exports of in dustrial supplies capital goods agricultural products and consumer goods exports of automotive products also picked up after having been low in recent months real imports were little changed in october with in creases in imports of automotive products and con sumer goods offset by a decline in industrial supplies shipping congestion and other bottlenecks continued to restrain overall trade in goods exports and imports of services edged up in october but remained low relative to prepandemic levels largely because international travel was still depressed incoming data were consistent with a pickup in foreign economic growth in the current quarter driven mainly by the reopening of asian economies following lock downs earlier in the year to contain a resurgence of covid cases strong gains in intraasian trade and solid readings of purchasing managers indexes also pro vided some early signs that production bottlenecks in the region were easing in contrast the introduction of new public health restrictions in europe in response to a new wave of covid infections appeared to have re strained economic activity in some european econo mies more recently the detection and rapid spread of the omicron variant prompted new international travel restrictions in many foreign economies inflation abroad continued to rise

re mained at low levels in september and october staff economic outlook the projection for us consumer price inflation pre pared by the staff for the december fomc meeting was higher than in the november projection the nearterm outlook was revised up reflecting fasterthanexpected increases both for a broad array of consumer prices and for wages supply chain bottlenecks were seen as con tinuing to put upward pressure on prices as a result the month change in pce prices was projected to move up further relative to octobers pace and to end the year around percent over the following two years the boost to consumer prices caused by supply issues was expected to partly reverse and energy prices were projected to decline pce price inflation was therefore expected to step down to percent in and to re main there in and projected inflation over this period was a little higher than in the previous pro jection as supply bottlenecks were assumed to resolve more gradually and as the salience of this years higher inflation readings was assumed to raise the underlying trend in inflation relative to the previous forecast longerrun inflation was still assumed to remain an chored at percent the staffs forecast for economic activity remained strong but was weaker on net than in the november projection although aggregate demand appeared to be rising sharply in the fourth quarter the emerging surge in covid caseloads and hospitalizations was ex pected to weigh on economic activity in the winter months in addition supply bottlenecks were expected to resolve more gradually than previously assumed all told real gdp was expected to post a sizable gain over as a whole and to rise a bit less rapidly in with the pace of growth supported by the continued reopen ing of the economy and the resolution of supply con straints in most sectors with the boost from these fac tors fading real gdp growth was projected to step down noticeably in given the higher forecast for inflation the staff assumed monetary policy would be less accommodative in coming years and therefore re vised down the mediumterm forecast for gdp some what even so the level of real gdp was expected to remain well above potential throughout the projection period and labor market conditions were projected to remain very tight the staff continued to judge that the risks to the baseline projection for economic activity were skewed to the downside and that the risks around the inflation projec tion were skewed to the upside in particular the possi bility that covid cases could continue to rise steeply especially if the omicron variant proves to be vaccine resistant was seen as an important source of downside risk to activity while the possibility of more severe and persistent supply issues was viewed as an ad ditional downside risk to activity and as an upside risk to inflation participants views on current economic conditions and the economic outlook in conjunction with this fomc meeting participants submitted their projections of the most likely outcomes for real gdp growth the unemployment rate and infla tion for each year from through and over the longer run based on their individual assessments of ap page federal open market committee propriate monetary policy including the path of the fed eral funds rate the longerrun projections represented each participants assessment of the rate to which each variable would be expected to converge over time un der appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy a summary of eco nomic projections was released to the public following the conclusion of the meeting in their discussion of current economic conditions par ticipants noted that with progress on vaccinations and strong policy support indicators of economic activity and employment had continued to strengthen the sec tors most adversely affected by the pandemic had im proved in recent months but continued to be affected by covid job gains had been solid in recent months and the unemployment rate had declined substantially supply and demand imbalances related to the pandemic and the reopening of the economy had continued to contribute to elevated levels of inflation overall finan cial conditions remained accommodative in part reflect ing policy measures to support the economy and the flow of credit to us households and businesses par ticipants commented that the path of the economy con tinued to depend on the course of the virus an easing of supply constraints was expected to support continued gains in economic activity and employment as well as a reduction in inflation risks to the economic outlook remained including from new variants of the virus participants observed that growth of economic activity appeared to have been strong in the fourth quarter after having slowed in the third quarter and they generally ex pected robust growth to continue in a few partic ipants cited healthy household balance sheets the need for businesses to rebuild inventory and accommodative financial conditions as factors supporting continued ro bust growth a couple of participants commented that business conditions appeared to be improving broadly including in sectors providing inperson services such as the retail restaurant and hotel sectors many partici pants noted that the emergence of the omicron variant made the economic outlook more uncertain several re marked that they did not yet see the new variant as fun damentally altering the path of economic recovery in the united states in their discussion of the household sector participants generally noted that demand for consumer goods had remained strong likely supported by accommodative fis cal and monetary policies increased household income as more people found jobs increasing net worth of the household sector and the high level of savings accumu lated through the course of the pandemic participants noted that supply chain bottlenecks and la bor shortages continued to limit businesses ability to meet strong demand they judged that these challenges would likely last longer and be more widespread than previously thought participants generally expected global supply chain bottlenecks to persist well into next year at least while several participants pointed to signs of incremental improvement in supply chains a few oth ers remarked that business contacts were experiencing deteriorating supply conditions that could be exacer bated by the emergence of new variants of the virus a couple of participants reported that some contacts were implementing permanent changes in their business mod els to help weather current and future disruptions in cluding holding larger inventories or building domestic manufacturing capacity many business contacts contin ued to experience difficulty hiring workers across all skill levels noting the lack of qualified candidates as well some participants noted that businesses were offering higher wages larger bonuses or more flexible work ar rangements to compete for workers participants judged that labor markets continued to strengthen with the unemployment rate falling rapidly and payrolls growing at a solid pace a few participants noted the recent decline in the unemployment rates of african americans and hispanics and the narrowing of the racial and ethnic gap in the primeage employment topopulation ratio as suggesting a more inclusive labor market recovery some participants discussed the mod est increase in the labor force participation rate in no vember a number of participants judged that a sub stantial improvement in labor force participation would take longer than previously expected a few others as sessed that any further improvement in labor force par ticipation would be quite modest participants cited a number of pandemic and economic factors likely de pressing labor force participation such as increased caregiving needs amid a shortage of workers in the care giving industry remaining concerns about the virus and healthy balance sheets for households including for those who retired early a couple of participants cited factors that could support higher labor force participa tion over the next few years including waning fiscal stimulus depleted savings particularly for lowerincome households and the historical tendency for labor force participation to lag improvement in the labor market participants pointed to a number of signs that the us labor market was very tight including nearrecord rates minutes of the meeting of december page of quits and job vacancies as well as a notable pickup in wage growth in line with the recent data showing a rise in the employment cost index many participants re ported district business contacts either planning or hav ing implemented larger wage increases to retain current employees or attract new workers participants generally noted that they were monitoring the incoming data for signs of inflationary pressures associated with the in creasingly tight labor market acknowledging that the maximum level of employment consistent with price sta bility may evolve over time many participants saw the us economy making rapid progress toward the com mittees maximumemployment goal several partici pants viewed labor market conditions as already largely consistent with maximum employment participants remarked that inflation readings had been higher and were more persistent and widespread than previously anticipated some participants noted that trimmed mean measures of inflation had reached dec adehigh levels and that the percentage of product cate gories with substantial price increases continued to climb while participants generally continued to antici pate that inflation would decline significantly over the course of as supply constraints eased almost all stated that they had revised up their forecasts of inflation for notably and many did so for as well in discussing their revisions to the inflation outlook partic ipants pointed to rising housing costs and rents more widespread wage growth driven by labor shortages and more prolonged global supplyside frictions which could be exacerbated by the emergence of the omicron variant moreover participants widely cited business contacts feeling confident that they would be able to pass on higher costs of labor and material to customers participants noted their continuing attention to the pub lics concern about the sizable increase in the cost of liv ing that had taken place this year and the associated bur den on us households particularly those who had lim ited scope to pay higher prices for essential goods and services in their comments on inflation expectations some par ticipants discussed the risk that recent elevated levels of inflation could increase the publics longerterm expec tations for inflation to a level above that consistent with the committees longerrun inflation objective they noted that the realization of such a development could make it harder for the committee to achieve percent inflation over the longer run a couple of participants pointed to reports of higher inflation expectations of businesses and of increased use of costofliving adjust ments in wage negotiations as early developments that could potentially affect the anchoring of inflation expec tations a few participants however noted that long term inflation expectations remained well anchored cit ing stable readings of marketbased inflation compensa tion measures or the generally low level of longerterm bond yields participants observed that uncertainty about the eco nomic outlook remained high most agreed that risks to inflation were weighted to the upside several partici pants pointed to the possibility that structural factors that kept inflation low in the previous decade such as technological changes demographics and the proximity of the elb in an environment of low equilibrium inter est rates may reemerge when the effects of the pan demic abate a couple of others noted the risk that per sistent real wage growth in excess of productivity growth could trigger inflationary wageprice dynamics partici pants generally continued to stress uncertainties associ ated with the labor marketin particular the evolution of labor force participationand with the length of time required to resolve the supply chain situation many par ticipants noted that the pandemic particularly new vari ants of the virus continued to pose downside risks to economic activity and upside risks to inflation in their consideration of the stance of monetary policy participants reaffirmed the federal reserves commit ment to using its full range of tools to support the us economy during this challenging time thereby promot ing the committees statutory goals of maximum em ployment and price stability participants discussed the progress the economy had made toward the criteria the committee had specified in its forward guidance for the federal funds rate participants agreed that the commit tees criteria of inflation rising to percent and moder ately exceeding percent for some time had been more than met all participants remarked that inflation had continued to run notably above percent reflecting sup ply and demand imbalances related to the pandemic and the reopening of the economy with respect to the max imumemployment criterion participants noted that the labor market had been making rapid progress as meas ured by a variety of indicators including solid job gains reported in recent months a substantial further decline in a range of unemployment rates to levels well below those prevailing a year ago and a labor force participa tion rate that had recently edged up many participants judged that if the current pace of improvement contin ued labor markets would fast approach maximum em ployment several participants remarked that they viewed labor market conditions as already largely con sistent with maximum employment page federal open market committee in support of the committees goals of maximum em ployment and inflation at the rate of percent over the longer run participants judged that it would be appro priate for the committee to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at to percent until labor market conditions had reached levels consistent with the com mittees assessments of maximum employment a condi tion most participants judged could be met relatively soon if the recent pace of labor market improvements continued a few participants remarked that maximum employment consistent with price stability evolves over time and that further improvements in labor markets were likely over subsequent years as the economy con tinued to expand some participants also remarked that there could be circumstances in which it would be ap propriate for the committee to raise the target range for the federal funds rate before maximum employment had been fully achievedfor example if the committee judged that its employment and pricestability goals were not complementary in light of economic developments and that inflation pressures and inflation expectations were moving materially and persistently higher in a way that could impede the attainment of the committees longerrun goals in light of elevated inflation pressures and the strength ening labor market participants judged that the increase in policy accommodation provided by the ongoing pace of net asset purchases was no longer necessary they remarked that a quicker conclusion of net asset pur chases would better position the committee to set policy to address the full range of plausible economic out comes participants judged that it would be appropriate to double the pace of the ongoing reduction in net asset purchases such a change would result in reducing the monthly pace of net purchases of treasury securities by billion and of agency mbs by billion starting in january participants also expected that economic con ditions would evolve in a manner such that similar re ductions in the pace of net asset purchases would be ap propriate each subsequent month resulting in an end to net asset purchases in midmarch a few months sooner than participants had anticipated at the november fomc meeting in addition participants remarked that the committee should continue to be prepared to adjust the pace of purchases if warranted by changes in the eco nomic outlook participants continued to stress that maintaining flexibil ity to implement appropriate policy adjustments on the basis of riskmanagement considerations should be a guiding principle in conducting policy in the current highly uncertain environment participants generally noted that given their individual outlooks for the econ omy the labor market and inflation it may become war ranted to increase the federal funds rate sooner or at a faster pace than participants had earlier anticipated some participants also noted that it could be appropriate to begin to reduce the size of the federal reserves bal ance sheet relatively soon after beginning to raise the federal funds rate some participants judged that a less accommodative future stance of policy would likely be warranted and that the committee should convey a strong commitment to address elevated inflation pres sures these participants noted however that a meas ured approach to tightening policy would help enable the committee to assess incoming data and be in posi tion to react to the full range of plausible economic out comes committee policy action in their discussion of monetary policy for this meeting members agreed that with progress on vaccinations and strong policy support indicators of economic activity and employment had continued to strengthen they noted that the sectors most adversely affected by the pandemic had improved in recent months but continued to be affected by covid job gains had been solid in recent months and the unemployment rate had de clined substantially they remarked that supply and de mand imbalances related to the pandemic and the reo pening of the economy had continued to contribute to elevated levels of inflation overall financial conditions remained accommodative in part reflecting policy measures to support the economy and the flow of credit to us households and businesses members also acknowledged that the path of the economy continued to depend on the course of the virus progress on vac cinations and an easing of supply constraints were ex pected to support continued gains in economic activity and employment as well as a reduction in inflation but risks to the economic outlook remained including from new variants of the virus as elevated inflation had persisted for longer than they had previously anticipated members agreed that it was appropriate to remove the reference to transitory fac tors affecting inflation in the postmeeting statement and instead note that supply and demand imbalances have continued to contribute to elevated inflation members also agreed that with the emergence of the omicron variant it was appropriate to note the risk of new vari ants of the virus in their assessment of risks to the eco nomic outlook minutes of the meeting of december page members agreed that the federal reserve was commit ted to using its full range of tools to support the us economy in this challenging time thereby promoting its maximum employment and price stability goals all members reaffirmed their commitment to seek to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of percent over the longer run members agreed that the postmeeting statement should be updated to reflect the committees assessment of the progress the economy had made toward the criteria specified in its forward guidance for the target range for the federal funds rate they agreed that the inflation cri teria in the guidance had been met and that the postmeeting statement should note that with inflation having exceeded percent for some time the commit tee expected that it would be appropriate to maintain the current target range of to percent until labor market conditions had reached levels consistent with the com mittees assessments of maximum employment in light of inflation developments and the further im provement in the labor market members decided to re duce the monthly pace of the federal reserves net asset purchases by billion for treasury securities and billion for agency mbs specifically beginning in january the committee would increase its holdings of treasury securities by at least billion per month and of agency mbs by at least billion per month mem bers also agreed that similar reductions in the pace of net asset purchases would likely be appropriate in subse quent months implying that increases in the federal re serves securities holdings would cease by midmarch under the committees outlook a few months sooner than had been anticipated at the previous meeting members noted that the committee was prepared to ad just the pace of purchases if warranted by changes in the economic outlook and that it was important to maintain the flexibility to adjust the stance of policy as appropriate in response to changes in the committees outlook for the labor market and inflation members also noted that the federal reserves ongoing asset purchases and hold ings of securities would continue to foster smooth mar ket functioning and accommodative financial condi tions thereby supporting the flow of credit members agreed that in assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy they would continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook and that they would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate in the event that risks emerged that could impede the attainment of the committees goals they also concurred that in as sessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy they would take into account a wide range of information in cluding readings on public health labor market condi tions inflation pressures and inflation expectations and financial and international developments at the conclusion of the discussion the committee voted to authorize and direct the federal reserve bank of new york until instructed otherwise to execute transactions in the system open market account in ac cordance with the following domestic policy directive for release at pm effective december the federal open market committee

it will be ap propriate to maintain this target range until la bor market conditions have reached levels con sistent with the committees assessments of maximum employment in light of inflation de

working through com ments received from policymakers and were aiming to page federal open market committee circulate a new draft soon noting the urgency in bring ing the new policy to completion the chair proposed that the committee vote on a final draft as soon in the intermeeting period as possible in the committees annual reconsideration of the state ment on longerrun goals and monetary policy strat egy all participants supported the statement as written and the committee voted unanimously to reaffirm with out revision in discussing the statement the chair noted that con sistent with previous communications a formal frame work review would commence in and conclude in that timing would allow perspectives on recent events to inform considerations of potential revisions to the framework statement on longerrun goals and monetary policy strategy as reaffirmed effective january the federal open market committee fomc is firmly committed to fulfilling its statutory mandate from the congress of promoting maximum employment sta ble prices and moderate longterm interest rates the committee seeks to explain its monetary policy deci sions to the public as clearly as possible such clarity facilitates wellinformed decisionmaking by households and businesses reduces economic and financial uncer tainty increases the effectiveness of monetary policy and enhances transparency and accountability which are essential in a democratic society employment inflation and longterm interest rates fluctuate over time in response to economic and finan cial disturbances monetary policy plays an important role in stabilizing the economy in response to these dis turbances the committees primary means of adjusting the stance of monetary policy is through changes in the target range for the federal funds rate the committee judges that the level of the federal funds rate consistent with maximum employment and price stability over the longer run has declined relative to its historical average therefore the federal funds rate is likely to be con strained by its effective lower bound more frequently than in the past owing in part to the proximity of in terest rates to the effective lower bound the committee judges that downward risks to employment and inflation have increased the committee is prepared to use its full range of tools to achieve its maximum employment and price stability goals the maximum level of employment is a broadbased and inclusive goal that is not directly measurable and changes over time owing largely to nonmonetary factors that affect the structure and dynamics of the labor mar ket consequently it would not be appropriate to spec ify a fixed goal for employment rather the committees policy decisions must be informed by assessments of the shortfalls of employment from its maximum level rec ognizing that such assessments are necessarily uncertain and subject to revision the committee considers a wide range of indicators in making these assessments the inflation rate over the longer run is primarily de termined by monetary policy and hence the committee has the ability to specify a longerrun goal for inflation the committee reaffirms its judgment that inflation at the rate of percent as measured by the annual change in the price index for personal consumption expendi tures is most consistent over the longer run with the federal reserves statutory mandate the committee judges that longerterm inflation expectations that are well anchored at percent foster price stability and mod erate longterm interest rates and enhance the commit tees ability to promote maximum employment in the face of significant economic disturbances in order to anchor longerterm inflation expectations at this level the committee seeks to achieve inflation that averages percent over time and therefore judges that following periods when inflation has been running persistently be low percent appropriate monetary policy will likely aim to achieve inflation moderately above percent for some time monetary policy actions tend to influence economic activity employment and prices with a lag in setting monetary policy the committee seeks over time to mit igate shortfalls of employment from the committees as sessment of its maximum level and deviations of infla tion from its longerrun goal moreover sustainably achieving maximum employment and price stability de pends on a stable financial system therefore the com mittees policy decisions reflect its longerrun goals its mediumterm outlook and its assessments of the bal ance of risks including risks to the financial system that could impede the attainment of the committees goals the committees employment and inflation objectives are generally complementary however under circum stances in which the committee judges that the objec tives are not complementary it takes into account the employment shortfalls and inflation deviations and the potentially different time horizons over which employ ment and inflation are projected to return to levels judged consistent with its mandate the committee intends to review these principles and to make adjustments as appropriate at its annual organi zational meeting each january and to undertake roughly minutes of the meeting of january page every five years a thorough public review of its monetary policy strategy tools and communication practices financial developments and open market operations the manager turned first to a review of domestic finan cial market developments over the intermeeting period treasury yields rose across the curve led by higher real yields expectations for tighter monetary policy ahead as well as an easing of covidrelated concerns were cited as contributing to the increase in yields the sp index declined around percent with sharp moves toward the end of the period reportedly prompted by concerns about the implications of a tighter path of monetary policy and rising geopolitical risks regarding the monetary policy outlook with data show ing continuing tightening of labor market conditions and elevated inflationary pressures policymaker communi cations were perceived as pointing to an earlier and faster removal of accommodation than market partici pants had previously expected against this backdrop respondents to the open market desks surveys of pri mary dealers and market participants almost uniformly projected that the federal reserves net asset purchases would end by midmarch the median survey projec tion for the commencement of balance sheet runoff shifted into the third quarter of this year roughly a year and a half sooner than in the december surveys most survey respondents also expected the portfolio to de cline at a significantly faster pace than they did in de cember expectations for the path of the federal funds rate shifted toward earlier rate increases and interest rate fu tures priced in an increase in the target range for the fed eral funds rate at the march fomc meeting on aver age respondents to the desk surveys assigned a roughly percent probability to an increase in the target range in march the expected path of the federal funds rate in the desk surveys and derived from interest rate futures also steepened over the period the median survey pro jection for the most likely level of the target range at the end of was about percent similar to december nonetheless survey respondents attached significant probability to outcomes in which the target range moved up more than indicated by the projected modal path changing views about the likely path of the federal re serves balance sheet following the release of the decem ber fomc minutes seemed to affect longerterm yields far forward real yields moved higher over the period with much of the increase following the release of the minutes for the december fomc meeting in addition agency mortgagebacked securities mbs spreads wid ened notably after having been stable at low levels for the past year reportedly driven by expectations for an earlier and faster runoff of agency mbs than had been expected the manager turned next to a discussion of international financial market developments sovereign yields in creased across advanced foreign economies afes re portedly driven by receding concerns about the omi cron variant elevated inflation readings and relatedly expectations that central banks would remove policy ac commodation sooner than had been expected several central banks concluded their net asset purchases late last year and more were expected to do so this year on the outlook for policy rates several central banks had either already increased their policy rates or were ex pected to do so later this year the manager provided an update on issues related to monetary policy implementation reductions in the pace of the committees net asset purchases had pro ceeded smoothly to date and functioning in treasury and agency mbs markets remained stable regarding the potential for the committee to reduce system open market account soma holdings in the future market participants generally anticipated that soma redemp tions could proceed smoothly at a somewhat faster pace than during the previous period of balance sheet reduc tion from to however some also noted that soma redemptions would require significant adjust ments to privatesector balance sheets as investors ab sorb the net increase in treasury and agency mbs issu ance to the private sector and money markets transition to lower levels of liquidity and that these adjustments could take some time the manager discussed expectations for the evolution of the federal reserves administered rates in connection with a potential future change in the target range for the federal funds rate the desk survey responses suggested expectations for administered rates to be raised by the same increment as the target range for the federal funds rate the manager noted that the current setting of ad ministered rates relative to the target range had been working well and anticipated that it could continue to support effective policy implementation following any increase in the target range in coming months although adjustments could be warranted over time by unanimous vote the committee ratified the desks domestic transactions over the intermeeting period no page federal open market committee intervention operations occurred in foreign currencies for the systems account during the intermeeting period principles for reducing the size of the balance sheet participants continued their discussion of topics associ ated with potential adjustments in the committees pol icy tools that may be appropriate to support the achieve ment of sustained strong labor market conditions and a return of inflation to levels consistent with the commit tees longerrun percent objective under a wide range of circumstances at this meeting participants dis cussed highlevel principles that could be released to the public to describe the committees approach for reduc ing the size of the federal reserves balance sheet they agreed that the principles would address at a high level the sequence of adjustments in the interest rate and bal ance sheet tools to reduce policy accommodation the committees approach to balance sheet runoff and its intentions for the longerrun size and composition of the balance sheet the participants discussion was pre ceded by a staff presentation that reviewed key consid erations raised by participants at the december fomc meeting and examined how the proposed set of princi ples which reflected those considerations compared with the policy normalization principles and plans is sued in in their discussion participants reaffirmed that changes in the target range for the federal funds rate are the com mittees primary means for adjusting the stance of mon etary policy as noted in the committees statement on longerrun goals and monetary policy strategy par ticipants judged that the timing and pace of balance sheet reduction would be determined so as to promote the committees maximumemployment and pricesta bility goals and that it would be appropriate to begin the process of reducing the size of the balance sheet after the process of increasing the target range for the federal funds rate has begun while participants agreed that de tails on the timing and pace of balance sheet runoff would be determined at upcoming meetings participants generally noted that current economic and financial con ditions would likely warrant a faster pace of balance sheet runoff than during the period of balance sheet re duction from to participants observed that in light of the current high level of the federal reserves securities holdings a significant reduction in the size of the balance sheet would likely be appropriate partici pants noted that the level of securities holdings con sistent with implementing monetary policy efficiently and effectively in an ample reserves regime was uncer tain and probably would remain so consequently mar ket conditions would have to be monitored closely to determine the appropriate longerrun level of reserves and the size of the balance sheet participants agreed that the committee should reduce the federal reserves securities holdings over time in a predictable manner primarily by adjusting the amounts reinvested of principal payments received from securi ties held in the soma they also agreed that the soma should hold primarily treasury securities in the longer run regarding these two principles many participants commented that sales of agency mbs or reinvesting some portion of principal payments received from agency mbs into treasury securities may be appropriate at some point in the future to enable suitable progress toward a longerrun soma portfolio composition con sisting primarily of treasury securities participants agreed that it was appropriate at this time for the committee to publish its highlevel principles for reducing the size of the federal reserves balance sheet they also agreed that it was important for the commit tee to retain the flexibility to adjust any of the details of its approach in light of changing economic and financial conditions participants noted that the principles would serve as an important guide in future deliberations on balance sheet reduction while no decisions regarding specific details for reducing the size of the balance sheet were made at this meeting participants agreed to con tinue their discussions at upcoming meetings following the conclusion of the discussion all partici pants supported the proposed principles for reducing the size of the balance sheet the committee voted unanimously to adopt the principles for reducing the size of the federal reserves balance sheet as shown below principles for reducing the size of the federal reserves balance sheet as adopted effective january the federal open market committee agreed that it is appropriate at this time to provide information regard ing its planned approach for significantly reducing the size of the federal reserves balance sheet all partici pants agreed on the following elements the committee views changes in the target range for the federal funds rate as its pri mary means of adjusting the stance of mon etary policy minutes of the meeting of january page the committee will determine the timing and pace of reducing the size of the federal reserves balance sheet so as to promote its maximum employment and price stability goals the committee expects that reduc ing the size of the federal reserves balance sheet will commence after the process of in creasing the target range for the federal funds rate has begun the committee intends to reduce the fed eral reserves securities holdings over time in a predictable manner primarily by adjust ing the amounts reinvested of principal pay ments received from securities held in the system open market account soma over time the committee intends to main tain securities holdings in amounts needed to implement monetary policy efficiently and effectively in its ample reserves regime in the longer run the committee intends to hold primarily treasury securities in the soma thereby minimizing the effect of federal reserve holdings on the allocation of credit across sectors of the economy the committee is prepared to adjust any of the details of its approach to reducing the size of the balance sheet in light of eco nomic and financial developments staff review of the economic situation the information available at the time of the january meeting suggested that us real gross domestic prod uct gdp growth had picked up in the fourth

increased in the fourth quarter however shortages of construction materials buildable lots and other inputs continued to weigh on activity in this sector business fixed investment appeared to post

budget positions and the widespread return to inperson schooling last fall the us international trade deficit widened at the end of last year imports of goods rose sharply in november and december led by increases in consumer goods while exports of goods were little changed over the two months on net after surging in october shipping con gestion and other bottlenecks continued to restrain the level of trade in goods meanwhile services exports jumped in november reflecting a sizable increase in ex ports of travel services after the reopening of us bor ders to vaccinated foreign travelers early in the month even so services trade was very low relative to prepan demic norms largely because the level of international travel remained depressed incoming data suggested that foreign economic growth picked up in the fourth quarter of as economies in emerging asia bounced back from lockdowns in the third quarter induced by the delta variant of the covid virus purchasing managers indexes pmis

the staff provided an update on its assessments of the stability of the financial system and on balance charac terized the financial vulnerabilities of the us financial system as notable the staff judged that asset valuation pressures remained elevated in particular the forward pricetoearnings ratio for the sp index stood at the upper end of its historical distribution highyield corporate bond spreads and the excess loan premium for leveraged loans remained at low levels and house prices grew strongly with pricetorent ratios that were at ele vated levels the staff noted that the market capitaliza tion of cryptoassets had grown significantly over the past decade and had experienced considerable volatility including sizable declines since late last year the staff changed its assessment of vulnerabilities associated with nonfinancial leverage from notable to moderate noting that measures of business leverage had declined to pre pandemic levels household delinquency rates remained relatively low while household borrowing rose but was concentrated among prime borrowers vulnerabilities arising from financial leverage remained moderate riskbased capital ratios for banks remained above their prepandemic levels even after the resumption of share holder payouts in contrast some available measures of hedge fund leverage continued to increase and im portant data gaps continued to limit a full assessment of vulnerabilities posed by many nonbank financial institu tions vulnerabilities associated with funding risks were characterized as moderate prime and taxexempt money funds continued to have structural vulnerabilities that may lead investors to withdraw funds quickly in a page federal open market committee stress situation and were a potential source of spillovers to other shortterm funding markets in response the securities and exchange commission proposed reforms in december to make these funds more resilient another vulnerability in funding markets was the signif icant growth in stablecoin arrangements over the past few years which may increase challenges related to run risk and pose additional risks from their potential role as a means of payment staff economic outlook the nearterm projection for us economic activity pre pared by the staff for the january fomc meeting was weaker than in december reflecting the sharp rise in covid infections caused by the rapid spread of the omicron variant and an assessment that supply con straints would resolve more slowly than previously ex pected although real gdp still appeared to have posted a sizable gain in the fourth quarter of out put growth was expected to slow noticeably in the first quarter of before picking up again later in the year as covid cases declined and supply issues contin ued to be resolved with most of the boost to growth from the reopening of the economy and easing of supply constraints expected to occur in real gdp growth was projected to step down in and to be roughly in line with potential growth in and however the level of real gdp was expected to remain well above potential throughout the projection period and labor market conditions were expected to remain very tight the staffs nearterm projection for pce price inflation was revised up relative to december in response to the anticipated slower resolution of supply issues in partic ular the staff continued to expect that monthly inflation rates would move lower as supply constraints eased but the projected stepdown was less pronounced than in the december forecast even so an improvement in supply conditions and a decline in consumer energy prices were expected to slow pce price inflation to percent in with supply conditions expected to normalize further but with the labor market expected to remain very tight pce price inflation was projected to decline to percent in before edging up to per cent in the staff continued to judge that the risks to the baseline projection for economic activity were skewed to the downside and that the risks to the inflation projection were skewed to the upside in particular the possibility that the economic effects of the virus would turn out to be larger than assumed in the baseline projection was viewed as an important source of downside risk to activ ity while the possibility of more severe and more persis tent supply issues was viewed as an additional downside risk to activity and as an upside risk to inflation participants views on current conditions and the economic outlook in their discussion of current economic conditions par ticipants noted that indicators of economic activity and employment had continued to strengthen the sectors most adversely affected by the pandemic had improved in recent months but continued to be affected by the re cent sharp rise in covid cases job gains had been solid in recent months and the unemployment rate had declined substantially supply and demand imbalances related to the pandemic and the reopening of the econ omy had continued to contribute to elevated levels of inflation overall financial conditions had remained ac commodative in part reflecting policy measures to sup port the economy and the flow of credit to us house holds and businesses participants judged that the path of the economy continued to depend on the course of the virus progress on vaccinations and an easing of sup ply constraints were expected to support continued gains in economic activity and employment as well as a reduction in inflation risks to the economic outlook remained including from new variants of the virus with regard to the economic outlook participants agreed that the omicron wave of the pandemic would weigh on economic activity in the first quarter of indeed sectors of the economy that are particularly sen sitive to pandemicrelated disruptions including travel leisure and restaurants were experiencing sharp reduc tions in activity as a result of the omicron wave partic ipants commented that for many afflicted individuals and families the virus continued to cause great hardship participants concurred that if the omicron wave dissi pated quickly then economic activity would likely strengthen rapidly and economic growth for as a whole would be robust participants cited strong house hold balance sheets rising wages and effective adapta tion to the pandemic by the business sector as factors supporting the outlook for strong growth this year however a number of participants noted that there was a risk that additional variants could weigh on economic activity this year participants noted that supply chain bottlenecks and la bor shortages had continued to limit businesses ability to meet strong demand with these challenges exacer bated by the emergence and spread of the omicron var iant in particular the omicron wave had led to much minutes of the meeting of january page more widespread worker absences due to illness virus exposure or caregiving needs which had curtailed activ ity in many sectors including airlines trucking and ware housing some participants reported that their business contacts were hopeful that the effects of the omicron wave would be relatively short lived nevertheless sev eral participants reported that their contacts expected the ongoing labor shortages and other supply constraints to persist well after the acute effects of the omicron wave had waned participants contacts also reported continued widespread input cost pressures which amid generally robust demand they reported having largely been able to pass on to their customers a few partici pants commented that agricultural businesses were ex periencing higher input costs and those higher costs were putting strain on the finances of those firms even as they experienced generally strong demand for their products in their discussion of the household sector many partic ipants noted that the onset of the omicron wave had damped consumer demand particularly for services with much of the recent weakness concentrated in high contact sectors such as travel dining and leisure and hospitality almost all of those participants anticipated that household demand would recover briskly if the omicron wave subsided quickly with spending sup ported by strong household balance sheets that were bolstered by high rates of saving earlier in the pandemic and ongoing robust gains in labor income participants noted that the labor market had made re markable progress in recovering from the recession as sociated with the pandemic and by most measures was now very strong increases in employment had been solid in recent months the unemployment rate had de clined sharply reaching percent in december job openings and quits were near record high levels and nominal wages were rising at the fastest pace in decades several participants commented that the gains on bal ance over recent months had been broad based with notable improvements for lowerwage workers as well as african americans and hispanics against this back drop of a generally strong and improving labor market many participants observed that the effects of the omi cron variant likely would only temporarily suppress the rate of labor market gains the labor force participation rate had edged up further over the past few months and some participants indicated that they expected it to con tinue to increase as the pandemic eased a couple of participants noted that the participation rate remained lower than trend levels that account for changing de mographics participants noted that their district contacts were re porting that labor demand remained historically strong and that labor supply remained constrained resulting in a broad shortage of workers across many parts of the economy as a result there was widespread evidence that the labor market was very tight including nearrec ord rates of quits and job vacancies as well as nominal wage growth that was the highest recorded in decades several participants reported that district business con tacts were either planning to implement or had imple mented larger wage increases than those of recent years to retain current employees or attract new workers a few participants also reported contacts having been forced to reduce operating hours or close businesses temporarily because of labor shortages acknowledging that the maximum level of employment consistent with price stability evolves over time partici pants expressed a range of views regarding their assess ments of current labor market conditions relative to the committees goal of maximum employment many par ticipants commented that they viewed labor market con ditions as already at or very close to those consistent with maximum employment citing indications of strong labor markets including the low levels of unemployment rates elevated wage pressures nearrecord levels of job openings and quits and a broad shortage of workers across many parts of the economy a couple of partici pants commented that in their view the economy likely had not yet reached maximum employment noting that even for primeage workers labor force participation rates were still lower than those that prevailed before the pandemic or that a reallocation of labor across sectors could lead to higher levels of employment over time participants remarked that recent inflation readings had continued to significantly exceed the committees longerrun goal and elevated inflation was persisting longer than they had anticipated reflecting supply and demand imbalances related to the pandemic and the re opening of the economy however some participants commented that elevated inflation had broadened be yond sectors most directly affected by those factors bol stered in part by strong consumer demand in addition various participants cited other developments that had the potential to place additional upward pressure on in flation including real wage growth in excess of produc tivity growth and increases in prices for housing services participants acknowledged that elevated inflation was a burden on us households particularly those who were least able to pay higher prices for essential goods and services some participants reported that their business page federal open market committee contacts remained concerned about persistently high in flation and that they were adjusting their business prac tices to cope with higher input costsfor instance by raising output prices or utilizing contracts that were con tingent on their costs participants generally expected inflation to moderate over the course of the year as sup ply and demand imbalances ease and monetary policy accommodation is removed some participants re marked that longerterm measures of inflation expecta tions appeared to remain well anchored which would support a return of inflation over time to levels con sistent with the committees goals in their discussion of risks to the outlook participants agreed that uncertainty regarding the path of inflation was elevated and that risks to inflation were weighted to the upside participants cited several such risks includ ing the zerotolerance covid policy in china that had the potential to further disrupt supply chains the possibility of geopolitical turmoil that could cause in creases in global energy prices or exacerbate global sup ply shortages a worsening of the pandemic persistent real wage growth in excess of productivity growth that could trigger inflationary wageprice dynamics or the possibility that longerterm inflation expectations could become unanchored a few participants pointed to the possibility that structural factors that had contributed to low inflation in the previous decade such as technolog ical changes demographics and a low real interest rate environment may reemerge when the effects of the pan demic abate uncertainty about real activity was also seen as elevated various participants noted downside risks to the outlook including a possible worsening of the pandemic the potential for escalating geopolitical tensions or a substantial tightening in financial condi tions participants who commented on issues related to finan cial stability cited a number of factors that could repre sent potential vulnerabilities to the financial system a few participants noted that asset valuations were ele vated across a range of markets and raised the concern that a major realignment of asset prices could contribute to a future downturn a couple of these participants judged that prolonged accommodative financial condi tions could be contributing to financial imbalances a couple of other participants cited reasons why elevated asset valuations might prove to be less of a threat to fi nancial stability than in past reversals of asset prices in particular they noted the relatively healthy balance sheet positions of households and nonfinancial firms the well capitalized and liquid banking sector and the fact that the rise in housing prices was not being fueled by a large increase in mortgage debt as suggesting that the financial system might prove resilient to shocks some partici pants saw emerging risks to financial stability associated with the rapid growth in cryptoassets and decentralized finance platforms a few participants pointed to risks associated with highly leveraged nonbank financial in stitutions or the potential vulnerability of prime money market funds to a sudden withdrawal of liquidity in their consideration of the stance of monetary policy participants agreed that it would be appropriate for the committee to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at to percent in support of the committees ob jectives of maximum employment and inflation at the rate of percent over the longer run they also antici pated that it would soon be appropriate to raise the tar get range in discussing why beginning to remove policy accommodation could soon be warranted participants noted that inflation continued to run well above per cent and generally judged the risks to the outlook for in flation as tilted to the upside participants also assessed that the labor market was strong having made substan tial broadbased progress over the past year in light of elevated inflation pressures and the strong la bor market participants continued to judge that the committees net asset purchases should be concluded soon most participants preferred to continue to reduce the committees net asset purchases according to the schedule announced in december bringing them to an end in early march a couple of participants stated that they favored ending the committees net asset purchases sooner to send an even stronger signal that the commit tee was committed to bringing down inflation participants discussed the implications of the economic outlook for the likely timing and pace for removing pol icy accommodation compared with conditions in when the committee last began a process of removing monetary policy accommodation participants viewed that there was a much stronger outlook for growth in economic activity substantially higher inflation and a notably tighter labor market consequently most par ticipants suggested that a faster pace of increases in the target range for the federal funds rate than in the post period would likely be warranted should the econ omy evolve generally in line with the committees ex pectation even so participants emphasized that the ap propriate path of policy would depend on economic and financial developments and their implications for the outlook and the risks around the outlook and they will be updating their assessments of the appropriate setting for the policy stance at each meeting participants noted minutes of the meeting of january page that the removal of policy accommodation in current cir cumstances depended on the timing and pace of both increases in the target range of the federal funds rate and the reduction in the size of the federal reserves balance sheet in this context a number of participants com mented that conditions would likely warrant beginning to reduce the size of the balance sheet sometime later this year in their discussion of the outlook for monetary policy many participants noted the influence on financial con ditions of the committees recent communications and viewed these communications as helpful in shifting pri vatesector expectations regarding the policy outlook into better alignment with the committees assessment of appropriate policy participants continued to stress that maintaining flexibility to implement appropriate policy adjustments on the basis of riskmanagement considerations should be a guiding principle in conduct ing policy in the current highly uncertain environment most participants noted that if inflation does not move down as they expect it would be appropriate for the committee to remove policy accommodation at a faster pace than they currently anticipate some participants commented on the risk that financial conditions might tighten unduly in response to a rapid removal of policy accommodation a few participants remarked that this risk could be mitigated through clear and effective com munication of the committees assessments of the eco nomic outlook the risks around the outlook and the ap propriate path for monetary policy committee policy action in their discussion of monetary policy for this meeting members agreed that indicators of economic activity and employment had continued to strengthen they noted that the sectors most adversely affected by the pandemic had improved in recent months but were being affected by the recent sharp rise in covid cases job gains had been solid in recent months and the unemployment rate had declined substantially members remarked that supply and demand imbalances related to the pandemic and the reopening of the economy had

a strong labor market members expected that it would soon be appropriate to raise the target range for the fed eral funds rate members agreed to continue to reduce the monthly pace of the committees net asset pur chases bringing them to an end in early march specif ically beginning in february the committee would in crease its holdings of treasury securities by at least billion per month and of agency mbs by at least billion per month members noted that the federal reserves ongoing asset purchases and holdings of secu rities would continue to foster smooth market function ing and accommodative financial conditions thereby supporting the flow of credit to households and busi nesses members agreed that in assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy they would continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook and that they would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate in the event that risks emerged that could impede the attainment of the committees goals they also concurred that in as sessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy they would take into account a wide range of information in cluding readings on public health labor market condi tions inflation pressures and inflation expectations and financial and international developments members agreed to remove the opening sentence from previous postmeeting statements regarding using the federal reserves full range of tools to support the us economy this language was adopted during the height of the financial market turmoil in march when the committee began its asset purchase program and mem bers acknowledged that it was no longer warranted in light of the strong economy as well as the committees announcement that net asset purchases would end in early march members agreed that the postmeeting statement should be updated to reflect the committees expectation that it would soon be appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate in light of ele vated inflation pressures and the strong labor market at the conclusion of the discussion the committee voted to authorize and direct the federal reserve bank of

economic policy advisor federal reserve bank of dallas justin meyer markets officer federal reserve bank of new york developments in financial markets and open market operations the manager turned first to a review of global financial market developments following the russian invasion of ukraine and the subsequent imposition of an array of sanctions the ruble depreciated roughly percent against the dollar prices of dollardenominated russian bonds plunged to percent and local trading of russian equities was suspended after a precipitous de cline in russian stock price indexes global financial conditions tightened reflecting declines in equity prices increases in sovereign yields and credit spreads and for the united statesan appreciation of the dollar prices of commodities that russia exports particularly oil and natural gas soared over the period while oil prices partially retraced late in the period options prices suggested considerable probability that oil prices could remain elevated or rise further in the months ahead alongside the rise in commodities prices measures of nearterm inflation compensation increased sharply across advanced economies in eastern european countries currencies depreciated notably and equity prices declined but most emerging market currencies outside of eastern europe depreciated only modestly or rose sovereign spreads for emerging market economies emes widened but the moves outside of eastern eu rope were relatively modest the developments in ukraine sparked some liquidity strains across markets overnight interest rates were steady throughout the period but there were some signs of pressures in term funding markets high levels of re serves in the banking system and the backstop facilities page federal open market committee in placethe new repurchase agreement facility for for eign and international monetary authorities fima repo facility and the standing repo facility srf as well as the standing central bank liquidity swap lines and the dis count windowlikely supported market confidence re garding the availability of liquidity and helped contain funding pressures amid a rise in market volatility trad ing liquidity declined across a number of sectors in the treasury market market depth fell and the price impact of trades increased modestly in some sectors overall however volumes were typical and markets continued to function in an orderly fashion notwithstanding uncertainties associated with geopolit ical developments many central banks continued to sig nal intentions to move ahead with reducing policy ac commodation to address elevated inflation market implied policy rates one year forward rose notably across many advanced foreign economies afes extending increases seen over recent months in the united states incoming economic data and fed eral reserve communications led investors to expect a more rapid removal of policy accommodation than they had previously expected market participants almost universally expected a basis point increase in the tar get range for the federal funds rate at the current meet ing moreover futures prices implied that the federal funds rate would increase around basis points through yearend about basis points more than had been priced in at the time of the january meeting simi larly the median projection of the target range for the federal funds rate in the open market desks most re cent surveys of primary dealers and market participants showed an increase of basis points this year the median projected path for the target range beyond rose another basis points by the first half of to a level modestly above the median projected longerrun level before returning closer to the longerrun level in consistent with shifting expectations for the path of policy shorterdated treasury yields rose notably over the intermeeting period and the spread between the year treasury yield and year treasury yield nar rowed market participants expected an earlier and somewhat faster reduction in system open market account soma holdings of securities than they did in january in the desk surveys almost percent of respondents projected balance sheet runoff to begin by july overall survey respondents expected a significant reduction in the balance sheet over coming years although there was a high degree of uncertainty around the magnitude of the total decline the manager turned next to a discussion of money mar kets and policy implementation market participants ex pected the interest on reserve balances rate and over night reverse repurchase agreement on rrp offering rate to be increased by basis points at the current meeting in line with their expected increase in the target range and anticipated that the changes would fully pass through to market overnight interest rates there was uncertainty around how on rrp usage might evolve in the near term as money market rates increased if banks lifted their deposit rates by less than the increase in re turns available on alternative investments depositors could shift funds into these alternatives leading to downward pressure on rates and increased on rrp takeup if instead deposit rates moved up in line with net yields on alternative investments on rrp takeup could remain relatively steady over the longer term however on rrp balances were expected to decline as the federal reserves balance sheet runoff proceeded and gradually lifted money market rates relative to the on rrp rate turning to desk operations the manager noted that the desk would be maintaining the size of the soma port folio through reinvestments until the committee di rected otherwise for treasury securities the desk would follow the usual practice of rolling over all princi pal payments at auctions in the absence of regular sec ondarymarket purchases of treasury securities the desk planned to maintain operational readiness by con ducting smallvalue purchases and sales of treasury se curities for agency mortgagebacked securities mbs the desk planned to continue to reinvest principal pay ments on a monthly basis through secondarymarket purchases the manager discussed a plan to simplify ad ministrative aspects of the soma holdings of agency mbs in coming months through a process of cusip committee on uniform securities identification proce dures aggregation the desk undertook similar pro grams of cusip aggregation following the conclusion of previous largescale asset purchase programs these past cusip aggregation programs were successful at reduc ing the cost and complexity of maintaining agency mbs holdings finally the manager provided an update on the srf the desk had onboarded four depository institutions as counterparties and noted that a number of additional banks were currently under review the desk planned to adjust the counterparty eligibility requirements in minutes of the meeting of march page early april to make the srf accessible to a broader range of banks in line with the committees intention to ex pand eligibility over time and with efforts to ensure that desk counterparty policies promote a fair and competi tive marketplace by unanimous vote the committee ratified the desks domestic transactions over the intermeeting period no intervention operations occurred in foreign currencies for the systems account during the intermeeting period plans for reducing the size of the balance sheet participants continued their discussion of topics related to plans for reducing the size of the federal reserves balance sheet in a manner consistent with the approach described in the principles for reducing the size of the federal reserves balance sheet that the committee re leased following its january meeting the participants discussion was preceded by a staff presentation that reviewed the committees ex perience with balance sheet reduction and presented a range of possible options for reducing the federal re serves securities holdings over time in a predictable manner all of the options featured a more rapid pace of balance sheet runoff than in the episode the options differed primarily with respect to the size of the monthly caps for securities redemptions in the soma portfolio the presentation addressed the po tential implications of each option for the path of the balance sheet during and after runoff the staff presen tation also featured alternative approaches the commit tee could consider with respect to soma holdings of treasury bills as well as alternative ways the committee could eventually slow and then stop balance sheet runoff as the size of the soma portfolio approached levels consistent with the committees amplereserves frame work for policy implementation in their discussion all participants agreed that elevated inflation and tight labor market conditions warranted commencement of balance sheet runoff at a coming meeting with a faster pace of decline in securities hold ings than over the period participants reaf firmed that the federal reserves securities holdings should be reduced over time in a predictable manner pri marily by adjusting the amounts reinvested of principal payments received from securities held in the soma principal payments received from securities held in the soma would be reinvested to the extent they exceeded monthly caps several participants remarked that they would be comfortable with relatively high monthly caps or no caps some other participants noted that monthly caps for treasury securities should take into considera tion potential risks to market functioning participants generally agreed that monthly caps of about billion for treasury securities and about billion for agency mbs would likely be appropriate participants also gen erally agreed that the caps could be phased in over a pe riod of three months or modestly longer if market con ditions warrant participants discussed the approach toward implement ing caps for treasury securities and the role that the fed eral reserves holdings of treasury bills might play in the committees plan to reduce the size of the balance sheet most participants judged that it would be appropriate to redeem coupon securities up to the cap amount each month and to redeem treasury bills in months when treasury coupon principal payments were below the cap under this approach redemption of treasury bills would typically bring the total amount of treasury re demptions up to the monthly cap several participants remarked that reducing the federal reserves treasury bill holdings over time would be appropriate because treasury bills are highly valued as safe and liquid assets by the private sector and the treasury could increase bill issuance to the public as soma bill holdings decline in addition participants generally noted that maintaining large holdings of treasury bills is not necessary under the federal reserves amplereserves operating frame work in the previous scarcereserves regime treasury bill holdings were useful as a tool that could be used to drain reserves from the banking system when necessary to control shortterm interest rates a couple of partic ipants commented that holding some treasury bills could be appropriate if the federal reserve wished to keep its treasury portfolio neutral with respect to the universe of outstanding treasury securities with respect to the federal reserves agency mbs re demptions participants generally noted that mbs prin cipal prepayments would likely run under the proposed monthly cap in a range of plausible interest rate scenar ios but that the cap could guard against outsized reduc tions in the federal reserves agency mbs holdings in scenarios with especially high prepayments some par ticipants noted that under the proposed approach to running off treasury and agency securities primarily through adjustments to reinvestments agency mbs holdings would still make up a sizable share of the fed eral reserves asset holdings for many years partici pants generally agreed that after balance sheet runoff was well under way it will be appropriate to consider sales of agency mbs to enable suitable progress toward a longerrun soma portfolio composed primarily of page federal open market committee treasury securities a committee decision to implement a program of agency mbs sales would be announced well in advance several participants noted the significant uncertainty around the future level of reserves that would be con sistent with the committees amplereserves operating framework against this backdrop participants gener ally agreed that it would be appropriate to first slow and then stop the decline in the size of the balance sheet when reserve balances were above the level the commit tee judged to be consistent with ample reserves thereby allowing reserves to decline more gradually as nonre serve liabilities increased over time participants agreed that lessons learned from the previous balance sheet re duction episode should inform the committees current approach to reaching ample reserve levels and that close monitoring of money market conditions and indicators of nearample reserves should help inform adjustments to the pace of runoff a couple of participants noted that the establishment of the srf which did not exist in the previous runoff episode could address unexpected money market pressures that might emerge if the com mittee adopted an approach to balance sheet reduction in which reserves declined relatively rapidly but several others noted that the facility was not intended as a sub stitute for ample reserves participants generally agreed that it was important for the committee to be prepared to adjust any of the details of its approach to reducing the size of the balance sheet in light of economic and financial developments no decision regarding the committees plan to reduce the federal reserves balance sheet was made at this meeting but participants agreed they had made substan tial progress on the plan and that the committee was well placed to begin the process of reducing the size of the balance sheet as early as after the conclusion of its upcoming meeting in may staff review of the economic situation the information available at the time of the march meeting suggested that us real gross domestic prod uct gdp was increasing in the first quarter at a pace that was slower than the rapid gain posted in the fourth quarter of labor market conditions improved fur ther in january and february and indicators of labor compensation continued to show robust increases consumer price inflation through januaryas measured by the month percentage change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures pcere mained elevated total nonfarm payroll employment grew strongly in jan uary and february the unemployment rate edged down on net from percent in december to per cent in february the unemployment rate for african americans and for hispanics declined over this period however both rates remained noticeably higher than the national average the labor force participation rate in creased in february as did the employmenttopopula tion ratio the privatesector job openings rate in janu ary as measured by the job openings and labor turn over survey was little changed on net from its novem ber level and remained well above its prepandemic level the quits rate also remained elevated average hourly earnings rose percent over the months ending in february about the same as its yearearlier pace with widespread increases across industries consumer prices continued to rise rapidly total pce price inflation was percent over the months end ing in january and core pce price inflation which ex cludes changes in consumer energy prices and many consumer food prices was percent over the same pe riod the trimmed mean measure of month pce in flation constructed by the federal reserve bank of dal las was percent in january percentage points higher than its yearearlier rate of increase in february the month change in the consumer price index cpi was percent while core cpi inflation was percent over the same period the staffs common inflation ex pectations index which combines information from many indicators of inflation expectations and inflation compensation had largely leveled off over the fall and was close to its average real pce appeared to be rising at a faster pace in the first quarter of than in the fourth quarter of as social distancing unwound further housing demand remained strong though activity in the residential hous ing sector continued to be restrained by shortages of construction materials buildable lots and other inputs available indicators suggested that growth in business fixed investment was picking up in the first quarter as growth in nonresidential structures investment turned positive available data suggested that motor vehicle production declined sharply in february as ongoing shortages of semiconductors and other supply chain problems con tinued to restrain output outside of the motor vehicle sector manufacturing production appeared to have moved up over january and february however this in crease did not appear to reflect a substantial reduction in supply bottlenecks as many indicators of the state of minutes of the meeting of march page bottlenecks showed little sign of improvement over this period in particular materials inputs such as electronic components and aluminum remained in short supply while broad measures of industrial input prices remained elevated separately transportation and distribution ac tivity continued to be held back by port congestion and a shortage of truck drivers available indicators suggested that real government pur chases were little changed in the first quarter after de clining in the fourth quarter of although real state and local purchases appeared to be rising federal de fense purchases appeared to be contracting further in the first quarter the us international trade deficit widened at the end of last year to a record high and surpassed that high at the beginning of this year imports of goods grew rap idly again in january led by increases in consumer goods while exports of goods fell back slightly from elevated fourthquarter levels shipping congestion and other bottlenecks continued to restrain the level of trade in goods services exports and imports fell back in january relative to december reflecting a reduction in travel to and from the united states because international travel remained depressed services trade was still very low rel ative to prepandemic norms incoming data suggested that the rapid spread of the omicron variant had tempered the foreign recovery around the turn of the year purchasing managers in dexes were consistent with the omicron wave having a notable effect on services activity but a rather muted ef fect on manufacturing activity and supplier delivery times moreover with covid cases having fallen in many regions authorities had already eased restrictions and social mobility had recovered except in china where lockdowns were recently reimposed the russian invasion of ukraine however constituted another neg ative shock to the global economy by pushing up com modity prices further hurting global risk sentiment and exacerbating supply bottlenecks inflation abroad con tinued to rise driven by recovering global demand rising retail energy and food prices and ongoing strains on global supply chains the effects of the russian invasion contributed to some of these inflationary pressures staff review of the financial situation financial markets were highly volatile over the inter meeting period with strained liquidity in some markets the russian invasion of ukraine led to periods of par ticularly elevated volatility and deteriorating investor risk sentiment nominal treasury yields and the expected path of policy rose during the intermeeting period driven by economic data releases and fomc communi cations that were viewed as implying a more rapid re moval of monetary policy accommodation than previ ously expected domestic equity indexes declined mod estly while those in europe fell noticeably financing conditions remained accommodative although borrow ing costs increased further investors interpreted incoming economic data and fed eral reserve communications as implying a more rapid removal of monetary policy accommodation than they had previously expected on net the expected path of the federal funds rate implied by financial market quotesunadjusted for term premiumsrose signifi cantly along with the yields on nominal treasury secu rities since the previous fomc meeting nearterm in flation compensation implied by treasury inflation protected securities rose sharply reflecting the higher thananticipated cpi releases and surging energy prices following the russian invasion of ukraine spreads of investment and speculativegrade corporate bonds widened noticeably since the previous fomc meeting and ended the period close to the medians of their historical distributions spreads of municipal bonds also widened significantly across credit categories broad equity indexes declined modestly on net amid significant fluctuations equity prices increased early in the period because of strongerthananticipated corpo rate earnings and economic data releases but they re traced these gains as investor risk sentiment deteriorated following the ukraine invasion the onemonth option implied volatility on the sp the vixsurged briefly immediately following the invasion but ended the intermeeting period slightly lower on net foreign asset prices were highly volatile over the inter meeting period in response to geopolitical develop ments central bank communications and rising infla tion concerns news related to russias invasion of ukraine in particular contributed to decreases in major foreign equity indexes especially in europe and a mod erate increase in the broad dollar index despite down ward pressure from the geopolitical events afe sover eign yields increased notably on net on higherthanex pected inflation readings and central bank communica tions that were perceived as less accommodative than expected eme sovereign spreads widened and eme

market makersdeteriorated in us treasury us equity and crude oil markets trading volumes generally remained within normal ranges in most markets and increased above normal levels in treasury markets later in the period bidask spreads did not increase notably in most markets however in vestors reported that strained liquidity at times amplified the volatility of price moves and may have contributed to the particularly large swings in treasury yields and eq uity prices late in the intermeeting period shortterm funding markets were mostly stable over the intermeeting period although spreads in some segments widened the effective federal funds rate and the se cured overnight financing rate generally held steady at basis points and basis points respectively overnight rates on commercial paper cp across most sectors also held steady although rates and spreads on longertenor cp and negotiable certificates of deposit increased amid the escalation of the ukraine invasion

shorterduration investments on rrp takeup was little changed averaging about trillion in domestic credit markets credit remained broadly available for most types of borrowers during the inter meeting period nonfinancial gross corporate bond is suance slowed noticeably in january and february re flecting lower demand for credit due to rising borrowing costs and elevated issuance over the past two years however issuance rebounded to healthy levels in march for investmentgrade firms with a few highyield firms also raising funds leveraged loan issuance was strong in january and february small business loan origina tions in december roughly matched prepandemic lev els the share of small firms that actively sought financ ing in the past few months and reported that it was more difficult to acquire credit compared with three months earlier remained very low for households both nonmortgage and mortgage credit remained accommodative credit card balances in creased significantly in the fourth quarter and auto credit outstanding grew at a moderate pace in decem ber the number of mortgage rate locks for home pur chases through february was elevated relative to pre pandemic levels mortgage credit for households with low credit scores continued to ease through february but remained tighter than before the pandemic the credit quality of large nonfinancial corporations and municipalities remained strong over the intermeeting pe riod the volumes of credit rating upgrades for corpo rate and municipal bonds outpaced those of downgrades moderately in january and february default rates on corporate bonds municipal bonds and leveraged loans remained very low most market indicators of future ex pected default rates for corporate bonds and leveraged loans also remained low credit quality in the commercial real estate sector con tinued to show some signs of stress delinquency rates for commercial mortgagebacked securities cmbs col lateralized by hotel and retail properties continued to de cline in january but remained well above prepandemic levels while those for cmbs in the office sector in creased somewhat in january but remained fairly low by historical standards for households credit quality remained fairly healthy delinquency rates for mortgages which include loans in forbearance and other loans behind on payments con tinued to trend down through december while those for prime auto loan and prime credit card borrowers re mained flat in december for nonprime borrowers de linquency rates rose in december although they re mained subdued by historical standards information on borrowing costs through february and early march suggested that the events surrounding rus sias invasion of ukraine did not have a significant effect on financing conditions during the intermeeting period borrowing costs continued to increase in many sectors but remained low relative to their historical distributions spreads in the corporate bond municipal bond and cmbs markets generally rose to somewhat above their prepandemic levels reflecting heightened geopolitical risks uncertainty about the outlook for monetary policy and elevated financial market volatility residential mortgage rates increased mostly as a result of widening mbs spreads which market participants attributed mainly to the tapering of the federal reserves agency mbs purchases and uncertainty surrounding the market supply of agency mbs that would accompany balance sheet runoff by the federal reserve interest rates on minutes of the meeting of march page new credit cards rose to roughly their prepandemic lev els while rates on auto loans also rose slightly but re mained significantly below prepandemic levels staff economic outlook the nearterm projection for us economic activity pre pared by the staff for the march fomc meeting was weaker than in january reflecting the anticipated eco nomic effects of the conflict in ukraine and financial conditions that were expected to be less supportive than previously assumed for as a whole real gdp growth was projected to step down markedly from its rapid pace before picking up slightly in as the continued resolution of supply constraints provided a small boost to growth real gdp growth was expected to slow further in to a pace that was in line with potential growth however the level of real gdp was expected to remain well above potential over the projec tion period and labor market conditions were expected to remain very tight the staffs nearterm projection for pce price inflation was revised up considerably relative to january the up ward revision reflected the staffs reaction to the persis tently high and broadbased levels of domestic inflation import price inflation and wage growth that had been observed as well as the staffs expectation that the up ward pressure on inflation from supply and demand im balances would last longer than previously assumed in addition total pce price inflation was further revised up to reflect higher expected paths for consumer energy and food prices all told total pce price inflation was projected to be percent in pce price inflation was then expected to slow to percent in and to percent in as food energy and import price in flation moved lower and as supply and demand imbal ances were resolved the staff continued to judge that the risks to the baseline projection for real activity were skewed to the downside and that the risks to the inflation projection were skewed to the upside the covid pandemic remained a source of downside risk to activity while the possibility of more severe and more persistent supply issues was viewed as posing an additional downside risk to activity and an upside risk to inflation the russian invasion of ukraine was perceived as adding to the uncertainty around the outlook for economic activity and inflation as the conflict carried the risk of further exacerbating supply chain disruptions and of putting additional up ward pressure on inflation by boosting the prices for en ergy food and other key commodities finally the pos sibility that continued high inflation would cause longer term inflation expectations to become unanchored was seen as another upside risk to the inflation projection participants views on current conditions and the economic outlook in conjunction with this fomc meeting participants submitted their projections of the most likely outcomes for real gdp growth the unemployment rate and infla tion for each year from through and over the longer run based on their individual assessments of ap propriate monetary policy including the path of the fed eral funds rate the longerrun projections represented each participants assessment of the rate to which each variable would be expected to converge over time un der appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy a summary of eco nomic projections was released to the public following the conclusion of the meeting in their discussion of current economic conditions par ticipants noted that indicators of economic activity and employment had continued to strengthen job gains had been strong in recent months and the unemployment rate had declined substantially inflation remained ele vated reflecting continued supply and demand imbal ances higher energy prices and broader price pressures with appropriate firming in the stance of monetary pol icy participants expected inflation to return to the com mittees percent objective over time and the labor mar ket to remain strong participants recognized that the invasion of ukraine by russia was causing tremendous human and economic hardship for the ukrainian people they judged that the implications of the war for the us economy were highly uncertain but in the near term the invasion and related events were likely to create signifi cant additional upward pressure on inflation and could weigh on economic activity with regard to the economic outlook participants noted that real gdp growth had slowed from its rapid pace in the fourth quarter of largely reflecting weaker in ventory investment but consumption and business in vestment continued to rise solidly the omicron variant left only a mild and brief imprint on economic data as households and firms appeared resilient to this wave of the virus relative to their december forecasts partici pants had revised down their projections for real gdp growth this year reflecting factors such as a slowdown in inventory investment from its strong pace late last year reduced fiscal and monetary policy accommoda tion and the russian invasion of ukraine which had led to higher prices of energy and other commodities in creased uncertainty and weighed on broader financial page federal open market committee conditions and consumer sentiment even so partici pants judged that economic fundamentals remained solid and that they expected abovetrend growth to con tinue sustaining a strong labor market participants commented that demand for labor contin ued to substantially exceed available supply across many parts of the economy and that their business contacts continued to report difficulties in hiring and retaining workers participants observed that various indicators pointed to a very tight labor market employment growth remained strong through the omicron wave a couple of participants highlighted that the annual bench mark revision to the establishment survey employment data revealed stronger employment growth in the second half of than was initially reported the unemploy ment rate had fallen to a postpandemic low and quits and job openings were at alltime highs although pay roll employment remained below its prepandemic level the shortfall was concentrated in a few sectors and re flected a shortage of workers rather than insufficient de mand for labor consistent with a tight labor market nominal wages were rising at the fastest pace in many years while wage gains thus far had been the strongest among the lowest quartile of earners and among produc tion and supervisory workers wage pressures had begun to spread across the income and skill distributions many participants commented that they expected the la bor market to remain strong and wage pressures to re main elevated a few participants noted that there were signs that the pandemicrelated factors that had held back labor supply might be abating and pointed to the notable increase in the labor force participation rate among primeage men in february participants remarked that recent inflation readings con tinued to significantly exceed the committees longer run goal and noted that developments associated with russias invasion of ukraine including the related surge in energy prices will add to nearterm inflation pres sures some participants noted that elevated inflation had continued to broaden from goods into services es pecially rents and into sectors that had not yet experi enced large price increases such as education apparel and health care a few participants also noted that the number of spending categories experiencing inflation rates above percent had continued to rise or that the trimmed mean inflation measure from the federal re serve bank of dallas had risen to its highest level since the early s many participants indicated that their business contacts continued to report substantial in creases in wages and input prices that were being passed through into higher prices to their customers without any significant decrease in demand participants com mented on a few factors that might lead the high infla tion readings to persist including strong aggregate de mand significant increases in energy and commodity prices and supply chain disruptions that were likely to require a lengthy period to resolve in addition some participants noted that recent higher inflation could af fect future inflation dynamics for example a few par ticipants commented that persistently high inflation readings might lead businesses when setting prices to be more attentive to aggregate inflation or more willing to raise prices in addition a couple of other participants noted that some household survey data suggested that nearterm consumer inflation expectations have become more sensitive to actual inflation readings since the be ginning of the pandemic a few participants commented that both survey and marketbased measures of short term inflation expectations were at historically high lev els several other participants noted that longerterm measures of inflation expectations from households professional forecasters and market participants still ap peared to remain well anchored whichtogether with appropriate monetary policy and an eventual easing of supply constraintswould support a return of inflation over time to levels consistent with the committees longerrun goal participants agreed that developments surrounding the russian invasion of ukraine including the resulting sanctions were adding to inflation pressures and posing upside risks to the inflation outlook participants noted that russia and ukraine were major suppliers of various commodities used in the production of energy food and some industrial inputs a continued cutoff of that supply from the world market would further push up prices for those commodities and over time lead to price increases in downstream industries the invasion had also exacerbated the disruptions of supply chains participants commented that by leading to higher en ergy and food prices weighing on consumer sentiment and contributing to tighter financial conditions the in vasion also negatively affected the growth outlook a few participants highlighted additional downside risks to growth associated with the war such as the risk that a more protracted conflict than the public currently ex pects could lead to much tighter global financial condi tions or other disruptions a couple of participants commented that the increased uncertainty might lead businesses and consumers to reduce spending though their business contacts currently were not seeing signs of such shifts or expecting a significant pullback in demand minutes of the meeting of march page several participants judged that the upside risk to infla tion associated with the war appeared more significant than the downside risk to growth as inflation was al ready high the united states had a relatively low level of financial and trade exposure to russia and the us economy was well positioned to absorb additional ad verse demand shocks in their discussion of risks to the outlook participants agreed that uncertainty regarding the path of inflation was elevated and that risks to inflation were weighted to the upside participants cited several such risks includ ing ongoing supply bottlenecks and rising energy and commodity prices both of which were exacerbated by the russian invasion recent covidrelated lockdowns in china that had the potential to further disrupt supply chains and the possibility that longerrun inflation ex pectations might become unanchored uncertainty about real activity was also seen as elevated various participants noted downside risks to the outlook includ ing risks associated with the russian invasion a broad tightening in global financial conditions and a pro longed rise in energy prices in their consideration of the appropriate stance of mon etary policy all participants concurred that the us economy was very strong with an extremely tight labor market and that inflation was high and well above the committees percent inflation objective against this backdrop all participants agreed that it was appropriate to begin a process of removing policy accommodation by raising the target range for the federal funds rate at this meeting they further judged that ongoing increases in the target range for the federal funds rate would be warranted to achieve the committees objectives par ticipants also agreed that reducing the size of the federal reserves balance sheet would play an important role in firming the stance of monetary policy and that they ex pected it would be appropriate to begin this process at a coming meeting possibly as soon as in may partici pants judged that the firming of monetary policy along side an eventual waning of supplydemand imbalances would help to keep longerterm inflation expectations anchored and bring inflation down over time to levels consistent with the committees percent longerrun goal while sustaining a strong labor market many participants noted thatwith inflation well above the committees objective inflationary risks to the up side and the federal funds rate well below participants estimates of its longerrun levelthey would have pre ferred a basis point increase in the target range for the federal funds rate at this meeting a number of these participants indicated however that in light of greater nearterm uncertainty associated with russias invasion of ukraine they judged that a basis point increase would be appropriate at this meeting many participants noted that one or more basis point increases in the target range could be appropriate at future meetings particularly if inflation pressures remained elevated or intensified a number of participants noted that the committees previous communications had already con tributed to a tightening of financial conditions as evi dent in the notable increase in longerterm interest rates over recent months all participants indicated their strong commitment and determination to take the measures necessary to restore price stability in that context participants judged that the committees approach of commencing increases in the target range for the federal funds rate and indicating that ongoing increases were likely was fully warranted participants judged that it would be appropriate to move the stance of monetary policy toward a neutral posture expeditiously they also noted that depending on eco nomic and financial developments a move to a tighter policy stance could be warranted a few participants judged that at the current juncture a significant risk fac ing the committee was that elevated inflation and infla tion expectations could become entrenched if the public began to question the committees resolve to adjust the stance of policy as appropriate to achieve the commit tees percent longerrun objective for inflation these participants suggested that expediting the removal of policy accommodation would reduce this risk while also leaving the committee well positioned to adjust the stance of policy if geopolitical and other developments led to a more rapid dissipation of demand pressures than expected participants agreed that the economic outlook was highly uncertain and that policy decisions must take ac count of the state of financial markets and the economy as always the committee would need to be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy in response to the evolving economic outlook and the risks to the outlook in this regard participants noted that developments as sociated with russias invasion of ukraine posed height ened risks for both the united states and the global economy against this backdrop all participants judged that risk management would be important in deciding upon the appropriate stance of monetary policy and that policy also would need to be nimble in responding to incoming data and the evolving outlook in particular all participants underscored the need to remain attentive page federal open market committee to the risks of further upward pressure on inflation and longerrun inflation expectations committee policy action in their discussion of monetary policy for this meeting members agreed that indicators of economic activity and employment had continued to strengthen job gains had been strong in recent months and the unemployment rate had declined substantially members also agreed that inflation remained elevated reflecting continued supply and demand imbalances higher energy prices and broader price pressures members agreed that geopolitical developments war ranted several changes to the postmeeting statement they concurred that the invasion of ukraine by russia was causing tremendous human and economic hardship and they agreed to update the statement to recognize this tragic situation members agreed that the implications of the war for the us economy were highly

san francisco and new york respectively attended tuesdays session only developments in financial markets and open market operations the manager turned first to a discussion of monetary policy expectations in the united states federal re serve communications since the march fomc meeting were perceived as signaling a more rapid removal of pol icy accommodation than had been expected resulting in significant shifts in expectations regarding the path of the federal funds rate for the current meeting federal funds futures implied around basis points of policy rate tightening and open market desk survey respond ents assigned an average probability of percent to that outcome the median desk survey respondents also projected basispoint increases in the target range at the two following meetings and another basis points of increases by the middle of next year bringing the pro jected midpoint of the target range to a peak of per centsubstantially higher than in previous surveys market participants continued to note significant uncer tainty regarding the economic outlook and the degree of policy tightening ahead this uncertainty was reflected in the dispersion in survey respondents average proba bility distribution for the target range at the end of regarding the outlook for runoff of the federal re serves securities holdings market participants widely expected the committee to announce the commence ment of balance sheet runoff at the current meeting median survey responses suggested that most market participants anticipated maximum redemption caps of billion per month for treasury securities and billion per month for agency mortgagebacked secu rities mbs with the caps phased in over roughly three months survey responses continued to reflect substan tial dispersion in views on the level of system open mar ket account soma holdings at which balance sheet runoff would end the manager turned next to a discussion of us finan cial market

borrowing rates also moved higher with year fixedrate mortgage rates rising above percent to the highest levels in over a decade equity indexes ended the period substantially lower on net these indexes moved up earlier in the period in connection with a perceived reduction in tail risks stemming from the war in ukraine but then moved lower reportedly because of increased caution regarding

the broad tradeweighted dollar up around percent over the period viewed over a longer time horizon fi nancial conditions as measured by many financial con ditions indexes had tightened by historically large amounts since the beginning of the year market and surveybased measures of us inflation ex pectations continued to project a significant deceleration in inflation in the coming years nonetheless farfor ward inflation compensation rose over the period and market participants remained attentive to the risk that in bringing inflation back to percent the committee would need to tighten by more than currently expected in global financial developments many advancedecon omy central banks raised policy rates over the period and investors increasingly came to anticipate tighter monetary policy ahead in most advanced foreign econo mies the bank of japan was an exception and was widely anticipated to maintain its accommodative poli cies the yen depreciated percent against the dollar over the intermeeting period to its weakest level in over two decades emerging market em currencies re mained relatively resilient market participants focused on the spread of covid in china and the effect of zerocovid policies which had resulted in increasingly widespread lockdowns the renminbi depreciated against the dollar around percent over the intermeeting period the manager turned next to a discussion of develop ments in money markets the effective federal funds rate rose basis points following the increase in the target range at the march fomc meeting and remained stable throughout the period secured overnight rates also rose by basis points following the march meet ing though modest softness emerged in subsequent days market participants noted that ongoing uncer tainty about the nearterm path of federal reserve pol icy had increased demand for very shortdated invest ments this demand combined with declining treasury bill supply contributed to the downward pressure on se cured rates and to rising overnight reverse repurchase agreement on rrp usage the manager expected that on rrp usage could remain elevated in coming months but anticipated that over the longer term usage would decline as balance sheet reduction proceeded the manager indicated that the desk was prepared to implement the committees plan for balance sheet re duction and that in the event that the committee an nounced the plan at the end of the current meeting the desk would issue a statement and faqs providing the public with details regarding the implementation of the plan the desk would closely monitor market condi tions and update the committee during the runoff pro cess the deputy soma manager reviewed developments concerning desk operations the desk planned to in crease the publication frequency of data on on rrp us age this additional information would provide the pub lic with greater transparency about usage of the on rrp facility the desk planned to publish the soma

aggregation and anticipated that this process would begin in coming months finally the deputy manager requested that the committee vote to maintain the standing us dollar and foreign currency liquidity swap arrangements and to renew the reciprocal currency arrangements with canada and mexico under the north american framework agreement in their discussion participants widely agreed that the standing swap lines are a critical tool allowing the federal reserve to address global dollar funding pressures that could otherwise adversely affect the us economy the committee voted unanimously to renew the recip rocal currency arrangements with the bank of canada and the bank of mexico these arrangements are associ ated with the federal reserves participation in the north american framework agreement of in ad dition the committee voted unanimously to renew the dollar and foreign currency liquidity swap arrangements with the bank of canada the bank of england the bank of japan the european central bank and the swiss na tional bank the votes to renew the federal reserves participation in these standing arrangements occur an nually at the april or may fomc meeting by unanimous

equipment and intellectual property products posting a large increase inventory investment moved lower after surging in the fourth quarter of and total real government purchases declined further led by a drop in defense purchases the us international trade deficit widened further in the first quarter of this year and net exports made a large negative contribution to real us gdp growth goods imports continued the fourth quarters strong growth driven by large increases in real imports of consumer goods capital goods and automotive products by con trast real exports of goods fell back after rising briskly late last year with broadbased declines in most major categories both real exports and imports of services grew at a moderate pace in the first quarter though both were held back by a tepid recovery in international travel amid ongoing waves of covid data suggested that foreign economic growth remained solid in the first quarter as most economies continued to show adaptability to new covid waves chinese data for march and april however showed declines in manufacturing and services activity and worsening sup ply bottlenecks after chinese authorities locked down shanghai and other cities to combat the spread of the omicron variant the ongoing russian invasion of ukraine also left its imprint on foreign economies with consumer and business sentiment declining in europe and global prices of a range of commodities continuing to rise foreign inflation increased significantly further driven by surging energy and food prices as well as some broadening of price pressures to core goods and ser vices in response many central banks around the world tightened their monetary policy stances staff review of the financial situation us treasury yields and the marketimplied federal funds rate path moved substantially higher over the in termeeting period as federal reserve communications and domestic economic data releases were perceived as suggesting that a more

in treasury yields borrowing costs increased in many sectors and were at or somewhat above prepan demic levels since the march fomc meeting and year treasury yields increased significantly on net the in creases in nominal treasury yields were primarily ac counted for by rising real yields while inflation compen sation implied by treasury inflationprotected securities was little changed alongside moves in shorterterm treasury yields the expected federal funds rate path implied by a straight read of overnight index swap quotesrose notably since the march fomc meeting page federal open market committee broad equity indexes decreased over the intermeeting period early in the period equity prices increased sup ported by the robust pace of economic activity and re duced market concerns about the implications for the global economy of russias invasion of ukraine the initial sharp gains in stock prices were followed by larger declines later in the period as longerterm interest rates rose substantially and as some disappointing earnings re ports toward the end of the intermeeting period weighed on equity prices the vix declined substantially early in the period but ended the period little changed on net remaining at elevated levels similarly spreads on invest ment and speculativegrade corporate bonds narrowed moderately earlier in the intermeeting period and then widened ending the period only slightly narrower on net and below the median of their historical distribution spreads on municipal bonds were up modestly and stood at about the th percentile of their historical dis

consistent with the downward pressure on repo rates daily takeup in the on rrp facility remained elevated spreads on most types of longertenor commercial pa per and negotiable certificates of deposit narrowed re portedly reflecting reduced market concerns about the effects of russias invasion of ukraine although some of the spreads remained slightly wider than those seen earlier this year over the intermeeting period sovereign yields in afes increased notably because of concerns about further in flationary pressures some central bank communications that were perceived as less accommodative than ex pected and spillovers from rises in us treasury yields prospects of tighter monetary policy and covidre lated lockdowns in china weighed on prices of risky as sets but investor concerns surrounding the economic effects of the war in ukraine seemed to abate partially on balance major foreign equity indexes registered mixed and relatively modest changes the us dollar generally strengthened with a more pronounced dollar appreciation against afe currencies as us treasury yields generally rose more than their afe counterparts among em currencies the dollar appreciated signifi cantly against the chinese renminbi over the intermeeting period along with the increase in treasury yields borrowing costs increased in many sec tors and were at or somewhat above prepandemic lev els credit remained widely available and borrower credit quality continued to be strong overall borrowing costs for residential mortgage loans increased substantially with the year mortgage offer rates reaching levels not seen since this increase largely reflected the rise in the year treasury yield corpo rate bond yields also increased although the effect of the increase in treasury yields was partly offset by narrower spreads municipal bond yields also increased notably bank loan rates for commercial borrowers increased and rates on large syndicated loans were roughly in line with prepandemic levels in consumer credit markets rates on auto loans and new credit card offers continued to trend upward credit which remained widely available for most types of borrowers was broadly in line with prepandemic lev els gross nonfinancial corporate bond issuance re bounded sharply in march mostly reflecting an increase in investmentgrade issuance while gross institutional leveraged loan issuance slowed amid elevated geopoliti cal uncertainty commercial and industrial ci loans and commercial real estate cre loans on bank balance sheets also grew robustly in march respondents in the april senior loan officer opinion survey on bank lending prac tices sloos reported a continued easing of lending terms and strengthening demand for ci loans as well as easing standards for multifamily cre loans for most small businesses credit appeared to be availa ble although these businesses demand for credit report edly remained weak in the april sloos large banks reported unchanged standards on ci loans to small firms while small banks tightened standards modestly to such firms in consumer credit markets credit card balances grew strongly in the first quarter amid easing standards and greater utilization and auto credit outstanding continued to grow steadily through february despite vehicle pro duction shortfalls and low vehicle inventories residen tial mortgage credit conditions remained accommoda minutes of the meeting of may page tive through march despite the increase in mortgage in terest rates particularly for stronger borrowers who met standard loan criteria the credit quality of firms municipalities and house holds remained strong overall the volume of credit rat ing upgrades for corporate bonds outpaced downgrades moderately in march continuing a nearly yearlong pat tern the credit quality of ci loans on banks books continued to be strong as delinquency and default rates both remained low delinquency rates on bank and nonbank loans to small businesses edged down in feb ruary while in the cre sector borrower financial health continued to recover household credit quality re mained strong and delinquency rates across both prime and nonprime borrowers continued to be subdued by historical standards the staff provided an update on its assessment of the stability of the financial system the staff judged that amid a substantial upward shift in interest rates russias invasion of ukraine and ongoing disruptions to supply chains the financial systemoutside of commodities marketshad been resilient however larger or pro longed disruptions in commodities markets could inter fere with other markets and real activity more broadly to date however such potential spillovers appeared to be limited the staff noted that increased uncertainty and ongoing volatility had reduced risk appetite in financial markets and eased price pressures although valuations of many assets remained elevated cre valuations appeared somewhat elevated except for sectors that were affected most by the pandemic residential house prices had risen rapidly although the staff continued to see key dif ferences from the previous debtfueled housing boom the mortgage finance reforms enacted after lim ited the potential for significant deterioration in under writing standards most new mortgage debt had been added by borrowers with prime credit scores and home owners equity positions were healthy the staff assessed that aggregate household and business leverage was moderate households debttogdp ratio remained relatively low and there were few signs of in creased stress among lowerincome households busi ness debt remained elevated relative to its prepandemic history but interest coverage ratios were high the staff assessed that vulnerabilities arising from finan cial leverage remained moderate on balance despite market volatility the banking sector continued to be well capitalized with strong liquidity the staff noted that leverage at key nonbank financial institutions nbfis was elevated and that bank lending to nbfis continued to increase notably relatedly nbfis reliance on bank credit lines to meet unexpected liquidity needs could generate moderate liquidity pressures at large banks dur ing times of financial stress with regard to funding risk the staff highlighted structural vulnerabilities in some types of mutual funds as a continuing focus staff economic outlook the projection for us economic activity prepared by the staff for the may fomc meeting implied a trajectory for real gdp that was broadly similar to the march pro jection the staff noted that the firstquarter decline in real gdp was driven by categories of spending that had often been volatile in the past and they viewed the con tinued strength in private domestic final demand the la bor market and industrial production as providing a more accurate picture of the economys direction in the first quarter the staff therefore anticipated that gdp growth would rebound in the second quarter and ad vance at a solid pace over the remainder of the year gdp growth was then expected to slow in and as monetary policy became less accommodative and financial conditions tightened further by real gdp growth was expected to be in line with potential output growth however the level of real gdp was ex pected to remain well above potential over the projec tion period and labor market conditions were expected to remain very tight the staffs projection for pce price inflation was re vised up slightly in the second half of and in in response to the slow resolution of supply constraints seen over the first part of a higher projected path for import prices and a judgment that wage increases would put more upward pressure on services prices than previously assumed all told total pce price inflation was expected to be percent in pce price in flation was then expected to step down to percent in and to percent in as supplydemand im balances in the economy were reduced by slowing aggre gate demand and an anticipated easing of supply con straints the staff continued to judge that the risks to the baseline projection for real activity were skewed to the downside and that the risks to the inflation projection were skewed to the upside the war in ukraine was seen as a possible source of even greater upward pressure on energy and commodity prices while the war and adverse develop ments associated with rising covid infections in china were both perceived as increasing the risk that supply page federal open market committee chain disruptions and production constraints would be further exacerbated in the united states and abroad participants views on current conditions and the economic outlook in their discussion of current economic conditions par ticipants noted that although overall economic activity had edged down in the first quarter household spending and business fixed investment had remained strong job gains had been robust in recent months and the unem ployment rate had declined substantially inflation re mained elevated reflecting continued supply and de mand imbalances higher energy prices and broader price pressures participants recognized that the inva sion of ukraine by russia was causing tremendous hu man and economic hardship for the ukrainian people participants judged that the implications for the us economy were highly uncertain the invasion and re lated events were creating additional upward pressure on inflation and were likely to weigh on economic activity in addition participants judged that covidrelated lockdowns in china were likely to exacerbate supply chain disruptions against this background participants stated that they were highly attentive to inflation risks participants commented that after its rapid growth in the last quarter of real gdp had declined in the first quarter of this year with net exports and inventory in vestment making large negative contributions to growth they noted however that these volatile components tended to contain little signal about subsequent growth and that household spending and business fixed invest ment had remained strong in the first quarter these advances and the further tightening of labor market con ditions were judged consistent with significant underly ing momentum in the domestic economy in line with this judgment participants expected that real gdp would grow solidly in the current quarter in their dis cussion of the economic outlook beyond the near term participants indicated that they expected that output would expand more moderately this year than in with growth this year likely near or above its longerrun rate and that the imbalance between aggregate demand and aggregate supply would diminish over time partic ipants saw an appropriate firming of monetary policy as playing a central role in addressing this imbalance and in supporting the federal reserves goals of maximum em ployment and price stability an easing of supply bottle necks a further rise in labor force participation and the waning effects of pandemicrelated fiscal policy support were cited as additional factors that could help reduce the supplydemand imbalances in the economy and lower inflation over the medium term that said the timing and magnitude of these effects were uncertain participants recognized the need to adjust the stance of policy depending on how these and other factors played out over time in their discussion of the household sector participants indicated that they expected robust growth in consump tion spending they pointed to several elements sup porting this outlook including strong household balance sheets wide availability of jobs and the us economys resilience in the face of new waves of the virus the considerable increases in treasury yields across maturi ties over the intermeeting period were associated with rising interest rates faced by households particularly rates on home mortgages a couple of participants re ported that their business contacts continued to see ro bust housing demand and elevated home prices despite higher mortgage interest rates with respect to the business sector participants cited ro bust consumer demand healthy household balance sheets and inventory rebuilding as factors supportive of business activity and investment the ability of firms to meet demand continued to be limited by labor shortages and supply chain bottlenecks although some partici pants noted that their business contacts had reported an easing of supply constraints participants assessed that supply constraints overall were still significant and would likely take some time to be resolved in addition the invasion of ukraine by russia and covidrelated lockdowns in china were seen as likely to exacerbate supply chain disruptions a few participants indicated that some of their business contacts were reportedly hes itant to expand capacity or had postponed construction projects participants commented that demand for labor contin ued to outstrip available supply across many parts of the economy and that their business contacts continued to report difficulties in hiring and retaining workers they observed that various indicators pointed to a very tight labor market employment growth had continued at a strong pace the unemployment rate had fallen to a near year low quits and job openings had remained ex tremely elevated and nominal wages had continued to rise rapidly a few participants noted that there were signs that the pandemicrelated factors that had held back labor supply might be abating further especially in the case of primeage workers in addition a few other participants suggested that the unwelcome erosion of real incomes due to high inflation may have contributed to the increase in labor supply many participants indi cated that they expected the labor market to remain tight minutes of the meeting of may page and wage pressures to stay elevated for some time sev eral participants raised the possibility that in light of the exceptionally high ratio of vacancies to job searchers a moderation in labor demand might serve to reduce va cancies and wage pressures without having significant ef fects on the unemployment rate participants observed that inflation continued to run well above the committees longerrun goal and that in flation pressures were evident in a broad array of goods and services various participants remarked on the hardship caused by elevated inflation and heightened in flation uncertaintyincluding by eroding american families real incomes and wealth and by making it more difficult for businesses to make production and invest ment plans they also pointed out that high inflation could impede the achievement of maximum employ ment on a sustained basis participants noted that devel opments associated with russias invasion of ukraine including surges in energy and commodity prices were adding to nearterm inflation pressures in addition covidrelated lockdowns in china were likely to dis rupt global supply chains potentially adding further up ward pressure on the prices paid by us businesses and consumers most participants indicated that their busi ness contacts had continued to report that substantial in creases in wages and input prices were being passed through into higher prices to their customers a few participants added that some of their contacts were start ing to report that higher prices were hurting sales a number of participants observed that recent monthly data might suggest that overall price pressures may no longer be worsening these participants also empha sized that price pressures remained elevated and that it was too early to be confident that inflation had peaked many participants commented that measures of short term inflation expectations were elevated or that farfor ward measures of inflation compensation were near the upper edge of their historical range several participants judged that measures of longerterm inflation expecta tions derived from surveys of households professional forecasters and market participants still appeared to be broadly consistent with the committees longerrun in flation objective likely reflecting respondents confi dence that the federal reserve would take the actions necessary to return inflation to percent they noted that together with appropriate firming of monetary pol icy and an eventual easing of supply constraints well anchored longerterm inflation expectations would sup port a return of inflation to levels consistent with the committees longerrun goal in their discussion of risks to the outlook participants emphasized that they were highly attentive to inflation risks and would continue to monitor closely inflation de velopments and inflation expectations they agreed that risks to inflation were skewed to the upside and cited several such risks including those associated with ongo ing supply bottlenecks and rising energy and commodity pricesboth of which were exacerbated by the russian invasion of ukraine and covidrelated lockdowns in china also mentioned were the risks associated with nominal wage growth continuing to run above levels consistent with percent inflation over time and the ex tent to which households high savings since the onset of the pandemic and healthy balance sheets would sup port greaterthanexpected underlying momentum in consumer spending and contribute to upside inflation pressures in addition some participants emphasized that persistently high inflation heightened the risk that longerterm inflation expectations could become unan chored in that case the task of returning inflation to percent would be more difficult uncertainty about real activity was also seen as elevated various partici pants noted downside risks to the outlook including risks associated with the russian invasion and covid related lockdowns in china and the likelihood of a pro longed rise in energy and commodity prices several participants who commented on issues related to financial stability noted that the tightening of monetary policy could interact with vulnerabilities related to the liquidity of markets for treasury securities and to the private sectors intermediation capacity a couple of participants pointed to increased risks in financial mar kets linked to commodities following russias invasion of ukraine which had led to higher prices and volatility across a wide range of energy agricultural and metal products these participants observed that the trading and riskmanagement practices of some key participants in commodities markets were not fully visible to regula tory authorities and noted that central counterparties ccps needed to remain capable of managing risks as sociated with heightened volatility or that margin re quirements at ccps could give rise to significant liquid ity demands for large banks brokerdealers and their cli ents in their consideration of the appropriate stance of mon etary policy all participants concurred that the us economy was very strong the labor market was ex tremely tight and inflation was very high and well above the committees percent inflation objective against this backdrop all participants agreed that it was appro priate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate page federal open market committee basis points at this meeting they further anticipated that ongoing increases in the target range for the federal funds rate would be warranted to achieve the commit tees objectives participants also agreed that it was ap propriate to start reducing the size of the federal re serves balance sheet on june as described in the plans for reducing the size of the federal reserves balance sheet that would be issued in conjunction with the postmeeting statement participants judged that an ap propriate firming of the stance of monetary policy along with an eventual waning of supplydemand imbalances would help to keep longerterm inflation expectations anchored and bring inflation down over time to levels consistent with the committees percent longerrun goal all participants reaffirmed their strong commitment and determination to take the measures necessary to restore price stability to this end participants agreed that the committee should expeditiously move the stance of monetary policy toward a neutral posture through both increases in the target range for the federal funds rate and reductions in the size of the federal reserves bal ance sheet most participants judged that basis point increases in the target range would likely be appropriate at the next couple of meetings many participants as sessed that the committees previous communications had been helpful in shifting market expectations regard ing the policy outlook into better alignment with the committees assessment and had contributed to the tightening of financial conditions all participants supported the plans for reducing the size of the balance sheet this reduction starting on june would work in parallel with increases in the target range for the policy rate in firming the stance of monetary pol icy a number of participants remarked that after bal ance sheet runoff was well under way it would be ap propriate for the committee to consider sales of agency mbs to enable suitable progress toward a longerrun soma portfolio composed primarily of treasury secu rities any program of sales of agency mbs would be announced well in advance regarding risks related to the balance sheet reduction several participants noted the potential for unanticipated effects on financial mar ket conditions participants agreed that the economic outlook was highly uncertain and that policy decisions should be data dependent and focused on returning inflation to the committees percent goal while sustaining strong labor market conditions at present participants judged that it was important to move expeditiously to a more neutral monetary policy stance they also noted that a restric tive stance of policy may well become appropriate de pending on the evolving economic outlook and the risks to the outlook participants observed that developments associated with russias invasion of ukraine and the covidrelated lockdowns in china posed heightened risks for both the united states and economies around the world several participants commented on the chal lenges that monetary policy faced in restoring price sta bility while also maintaining strong labor market condi tions in light of the high degree of uncertainty sur rounding the economic outlook participants judged that riskmanagement considerations would be important in deliberations over time regarding the appropriate policy stance many participants judged that expediting the re moval of policy accommodation would leave the com mittee well positioned later this year to assess the effects of policy firming and the extent to which economic de velopments warranted policy adjustments committee policy action in their discussion of monetary policy for this meeting members agreed that although overall economic activity had edged down in the first quarter household spending and business fixed investment had remained strong job gains had been robust in recent months and the unem ployment rate had declined substantially members also agreed that inflation remained elevated reflecting con tinued supply and demand imbalances higher energy prices and broader price pressures members concurred that the invasion of ukraine by russia was causing tremendous human and economic hardship members judged that the implications of the war for the us economy were highly uncertain mem bers agreed that the invasion and related events were cre ating additional upward pressure on inflation and were likely to weigh on economic activity members also agreed that covidrelated lockdowns in china were likely to exacerbate supply chain disruptions in light of continuing inflation risks members judged that it would be appropriate for the postmeeting statement to note that the committee is highly attentive to the upside risks to inflation in their assessment of the monetary policy stance neces sary for achieving the committees maximumemploy ment and pricestability goals members agreed that with appropriate firming in the stance of monetary pol icy they expected inflation to return to the committees percent objective and the labor market to remain strong in support of these goals the committee de cided to raise the target range for the federal funds rate minutes of the meeting of may page to to percent and anticipated that ongoing increases in the target range would be appropriate in addition the committee decided to begin reducing its holdings of treasury securities and agency debt and agency mort gagebacked securities on june as described in the plans for reducing the size of the federal reserves bal ance sheet that were issued in conjunction with the postmeeting statement members agreed that in assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy they would continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook and that they would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate in the event that risks emerged that could impede the attainment of the committees goals they also concurred that their assessments would take into account a wide range of in formation including readings on public health labor market conditions inflation pressures and inflation ex pectations and financial and international develop ments following the monetary policy discussion which in cluded a consideration of plans for reducing the size of the balance sheet all participants indicated support for the proposed plans for reducing the size of the balance sheet the committee voted unanimously to adopt the plans for reducing the size of the federal reserves bal ance sheet as shown below plans for reducing the size of the fed eral reserves balance sheet as adopted effective may consistent with the principles for reducing the size of the federal reserves balance sheet that were issued in january all committee participants agreed to the following plans for significantly reducing the federal re serves securities holdings the committee intends to reduce the fed eral reserves securities holdings over time in a predictable manner primarily by adjust ing the amounts reinvested of principal pay ments received from securities held in the system open market account soma beginning on june principal payments from securities held in the soma will be reinvested to the extent that they exceed monthly caps o for treasury securities the cap will in itially be set at billion per month and after three months will increase to billion per month the decline in holdings of treasury securities under this monthly cap will include treasury coupon securities and to the extent that coupon maturities are less than the monthly cap treasury bills o for agency debt and agency mortgage backed securities the cap will initially be set at billion per month and after three months will increase to billion per month over time the committee intends to main tain securities holdings in amounts needed to implement monetary policy efficiently and effectively in its ample reserves regime o to ensure a smooth transition the committee intends to slow and then stop the decline in the size of the bal ance sheet when reserve balances are somewhat above the level it judges to be consistent with ample reserves o once balance sheet runoff has ceased reserve balances will likely continue to decline for a time reflecting growth in other federal reserve liabilities until the committee judges that reserve bal ances are at an ample level o thereafter the committee will manage securities holdings as needed to main tain ample reserves over time the committee is prepared to adjust any of the details of its approach to reducing the size of the balance sheet in light of eco nomic and financial developments after adopting the plans for reducing the size of the federal reserves balance sheet the committee voted to authorize and direct the federal reserve bank of new york until instructed otherwise to execute transactions in the soma in accordance with the following domestic policy directive for release at pm effective may the federal open mar ket committee directs the desk to undertake open market operations as nec essary to maintain the federal funds rate in a target range of to percent conduct overnight repurchase agreement operations with a minimum bid rate of page federal open market committee percent and with an aggregate opera tion limit of billion the aggregate op eration limit can be temporarily increased at the discretion of the chair conduct overnight reverse repurchase agreement operations at an offering rate of percent and with a percounterparty limit of billion per day the percoun terparty limit can be temporarily increased at the discretion of the chair roll over at auction the amount of princi pal payments from the federal reserves holdings of treasury securities maturing in the calendar month of june that exceeds a monthly cap of billion redeem treasury coupon securities up to this monthly cap and treasury bills to the ex tent that coupon principal payments are less than the monthly cap reinvest into agency mortgagebacked se curities mbs the amount of principal payments from the federal reserves hold ings of agency debt and agency mbs re ceived in the calendar month of june that exceeds a monthly cap of billion allow modest deviations from stated amounts for reinvestments if needed for operational reasons engage in dollar roll and coupon swap transactions as necessary to facilitate settle ment of the federal reserves agency mbs transactions the vote also encompassed approval of the statement below for release at pm although overall economic activity edged down in the first quarter household spending and business fixed investment remained strong job gains have been robust in recent months and the unemployment rate has declined sub stantially inflation remains elevated reflecting supply and demand imbalances related to the pandemic higher energy prices and broader price pressures the invasion of ukraine by russia is causing tremendous human and economic hardship the implications for the us economy are highly uncertain the invasion and related events are creating additional upward pressure on inflation and are likely to weigh on economic activity in addition covidrelated lock downs in china are likely to exacerbate supply chain disruptions the committee is highly at tentive to inflation risks the committee seeks to achieve maximum em ployment and inflation at the rate of percent over the longer run with appropriate firming in the stance of monetary policy the committee expects inflation to return to its percent ob jective and the labor market to remain strong in support of these goals the committee de cided to raise the target range for the federal funds rate to to percent and anticipates that ongoing increases in the target range will be ap propriate in addition the committee decided to begin reducing its holdings of treasury secu rities and agency debt and agency mortgage backed securities on june as described in the plans for reducing the size of the federal re serves balance sheet that were issued in con junction with this statement in assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy the committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook the committee would be

mckay senior research economist federal reserve bank of minneapolis developments in financial markets and open market operations the manager of the system open market account soma turned first to a discussion of financial devel opments over the intermeeting period there were sig nificant swings in asset prices and financial conditions tightened on net as market participants assessed incom ing information about the economy in the united states nearterm policy rate expectations shifted mark edly toward the end of the period particularly after the release of the may consumer price index cpi report ahead of the release of the report market expectations reflected a broad consensus that there would be basis point rate increases at both the june and july fomc meetings after the release of the higherthanexpected inflation data policysensitive rates pointed instead to a considerable probability of basis point moves at both the june and july meetings the marketimplied path of the federal funds rate moved higher at longer horizons as well market participants noted elevated uncertainty about the economic and monetary policy outlook across the yield curve rates on nominal treasury secu rities ended the period significantly higher primarily re flecting the revision in the outlook for monetary policy and the associated rise in real yields marketbased measures of inflation compensation continued to indi cate expectations that inflation would decline notably in coming quarters and measures of mediumterm infla tion compensation fell over the intermeeting period market participants reported that while liquidity condi tions in the market for treasury securities had been af fected by the elevated volatility in rates and larger trades were having an increased effect on pricing overall mar ket functioning had held up responding to higher in page federal open market committee terest rates and some concerns about the growth out look equity prices moved substantially lower over the period the manager turned next to a discussion of develop ments related to foreign central banks most major for eign central banks were proceeding on a path of remov ing policy accommodation in order to address elevated levels of inflation severalincluding those of canada australia and new zealandhad raised their policy rates basis points over the intermeeting period and some signaled the potential need for more forceful tight ening in order to address inflation risks the european central bank ecb announced an end to its asset pur chase program and signaled an intention to lift policy rates in july meanwhile the stance of monetary policy in japan was generally expected to remain highly accom modative though recent upward pressure on japanese government bond yields had led the bank of japan boj to step up its efforts to defend its yield curve con trol target on balance market participants were fo cused on the largely synchronous shift toward monetary policy tightening across most advanced economies regarding money market developments the manager noted that the basis point increase in the target range at the may fomc meeting passed through to the effec tive federal funds rate and was also transmitted to other overnight rates the federal funds rate held steady at basis points throughout the period while the secured overnight financing rate softened on net falling to the bottom of the federal funds target range later in the pe riod contacts attributed the downward pressure on se cured rates to high liquidity levels and declining treasury bill supply as well as elevated uncertainty about the in terest rate path which had increased demand for short term investments in this environment participation in the overnight reverse repurchase agreement on rrp facility increased and a greater share of activity in over night private repurchase agreement repo markets was conducted by lenders who lacked access to the facility the manager noted that if on rrp usage continued to rise it may be appropriate at some point to consider fur ther lifting the percounterparty limit over the longer term on rrp usage was expected to fall with the re duction in the size of the federal reserves balance sheet resulting in a gradual rise in money market rates relative to the on rrp rate the deputy manager turned next to a discussion of fed eral reserve operations and related topics in accord ance with the directive to the open market desk the reduction in soma securities holdings began in june under the initial monthly caps on redemptions of billion for treasury securities and billion for agency debt and agency mortgagebacked securities mbs under current staff projections the soma portfolio was anticipated to decline roughly billion by the end of as noted in the recent soma an nual report and reported in the boards firstquarter fi nancial statements for the federal reserve system the soma portfolio had an unrealized loss reflecting the increase in longerterm interest rates unrealized losses had no implications for federal reserve income and would eventually fall to zero as securities reached ma turity the staff projected that soma net income would decline and potentially turn negative with increases in the target range lifting the interest expense on some lia bilities and that this eventuality could result in a deferred asset entry on the federal reserves balance sheet nei ther unrealized losses on the federal reserves existing securities portfolio nor negative net income would im pair the implementation of monetary policy or the fed eral reserves ability to achieve its dualmandate objec tives on other operational matters the deputy manager noted that over the intermeeting period the desk onboarded three depository institutions as new counterparties for the standing repo facility srf resulting in a total of nine depository institutions approved to date as srf counterparties by unanimous vote the committee ratified the desks domestic transactions over the intermeeting period there were no intervention operations in foreign curren cies for the systems account during the intermeeting pe riod staff review of the economic situation the information available at the time of the june meeting suggested that us real gross domestic product gdp was rebounding to a moderate rate of increase in the second quarter after having declined in the first quar ter the labor market remained very tight but there were some signs that momentum was slowing con sumer price inflationas measured by the month percentage change in the price index for personal con sumption expenditures pceremained elevated in april and available information suggested that inflation was still elevated in may total nonfarm payroll employment rose solidly in april and may though the pace of increase was slower than in the first quarter and the unemployment rate remained unchanged at percent the unemployment rates for african americans and for hispanics were little minutes of the meeting of june page changed on net though both rates remained noticeably higher than the national average on net the labor force participation rate edged down between march

inflation remained elevated total pce price inflation was percent over the months end ing in april and core pce price inflation which ex cludes changes in consumer energy prices and many consumer food prices was percent over the same pe riod the trimmed mean measure of month pce price inflation constructed by the federal reserve bank of dallas was percent in april nearly percentage points higher than its yearearlier rate of increase in may the month change in the cpi was percent while core cpi inflation was percent over the same period measures of inflation expectations derived from surveys of professional forecasters and of consumers generally suggested that inflation was expected to remain high in the short run but then fall back toward levels consistent with a longerrun rate of percent production and spending indicators were mixed but gen erally remained strong consumer spending and indus trial production posted sizable gains in april however retail sales declined in may data on home sales and sin glefamily housing starts moved down in april some in dicators of manufacturing activity weakened in may and the university of michigan surveys of consumers meas ure of consumer sentiment decreased noticeably in the preliminary june reading supply disruptions appeared to have improved in some sectors such as general mer chandise retailers but to have deteriorated in others such as materials for home construction on balance the available indicators suggested that private domestic final purchases were increasing at a slower pace in the second quarter than in the first quarter and with the available trade data for april pointing to a rebound in exports and a moderation in import growth in the sec ond quarter gdp growth appeared to be rebounding after having declined in the first quarter regarding trade real imports of goods stepped back in april from their exceptional strength in march driven by a decline in consumer goods imports by contrast real goods exports grew in both march and april after declining in the previous two months following some normalization in categories such as soybeans and phar maceuticals which can exhibit large and idiosyncratic changes exports and imports of services continued to be held back by an incomplete recovery of international travel the nominal us international trade deficit wid ened to a record size in march and then reversed that widening in april incoming data suggested that the global reverberations from lockdown measures to deal with the spread of the covid virus in china and the russian invasion of ukraine slowed foreign economic growth in china ac tivity indicators pointed to a sizable restraint on eco nomic activity the russian invasion of ukraine contin ued to have an imprint on foreign activity with persis tent stresses in global commodity markets and declining consumer and business confidence especially in europe inflation abroad moved higher driven by further in creases in consumer energy and food prices as well as some additional broadening of price pressures to core goods and services central banks around the world fur ther tightened their monetary policy stances to curb high inflation staff review of the financial situation over the intermeeting period us treasury yields and the marketimplied federal funds rate path moved sub stantially higher on net broad

on net early in the intermeeting period treasury yields moved lower amid rising concerns about a weakening us growth outlook and federal reserve communications perceived as lowering the chances of

levels and indicated that credit appeared to be available residential mortgage credit remained widely available through may for most borrowers while refinance vol umes continued trending lower in april and may amid higher mortgage rates outstanding balances of home eq uity lines of credit at commercial banks posted the first significant increase in more than a decade likely reflect ing a substitution by homeowners away from cashout refinances in consumer credit markets auto loans out standing grew at a robust pace in the first quarter con sistent with a rebound in auto sales but slowed in april and may credit card balances at commercial banks rose in april at the fastest pace seen in recent decades but growth slowed in may minutes of the meeting of june page borrowing costs had continued to increase in many sec tors since the previous fomc meeting yields on non financial corporate bonds remained well above pre pandemic levels and new issuance spreads for institu tional leveraged loans ticked up in may bank interest rates for both ci and cre loans also increased among small businesses that borrow on a regular basis the share facing higher borrowing costs rose in both april and may borrowing costs for residential mortgage loans increased significantly over the intermeeting pe riod in line with the increases in mbs and treasury yields reaching their highest levels since in con sumer credit markets rates on auto loans and new credit card offers continued to trend upward despite the historically low volumes of defaults on both corporate bonds and leveraged loans in april in the later weeks of the intermeeting period the volume of credit rating downgrades of leveraged loans exceeded the vol ume of upgrades in addition market indicators of fu ture default expectations of businesses deteriorated to some extent as investors appeared to mark down their assessment of the macroeconomic outlook credit quality of business loans on banks books re mained sound with ci and cre delinquency rates continuing to be low through march nonetheless banks allocated net positive loan loss provisions in the first quarter of this year this development reversed a pattern of loan loss reserves being released throughout last year and reflected concerns about the credit quality outlook delinquency rates on cmbs and small busi ness loans continued to decline and the credit quality of municipal securities remained strong household credit quality remained solid with the share of consumers with subprime credit scores still near his torical lows in addition mortgage delinquencies and the share of mortgages in forbearance both continued to trend down in recent months while nonprime auto loan delinquency rates edged down a touch in the first quarter credit card delinquency rates for account hold ers with belowprime credit scores inched up from low levels the sizable increases in credit card purchase vol umes through march were roughly offset by high levels of credit card payments thus increasing household bor rowing only slightly staff economic outlook the projection for us economic activity prepared by the staff for the june fomc meeting implied a trajectory for real gdp that was lower than in the may projection the staff continued to project that gdp growth would rebound in the second quarter and remain solid over the remainder of the year however monetary policy was assumed to be less accommodative than in the previous projection and the recent and prospective tightening of financial conditions led the staff to reduce its gdp growth forecast for the second half of and for the level of real gdp was still expected to remain well above potential over the projection period though the gap was projected to narrow significantly this year and to narrow a little further next year labor market conditions also were expected to remain very tight albeit somewhat less so than in the previous projection with regard to pce price inflation the staff revised up its projection for the second half of in response to strongerthanexpected wage growth and the staffs as sessment that the boost to inflation from supply demand imbalances in the economy including in food and energy markets would be more persistent than pre viously assumed all told total pce price inflation was expected to be percent in while core inflation was expected to be percent pce price inflation was then expected to step down to percent in and to percent in as energy prices were forecast to decline and as supplydemand imbalances were pro jected to diminish because of slowing aggregate demand and an easing of supply constraints similarly core in flation was projected to slow to percent in and to percent in the staff continued to judge that the risks to the baseline projection for real activity were skewed to the downside and that the risks to the inflation projection were skewed to the upside the staff judged that the ongoing war in ukraine remained a possible source of even greater up ward pressure on energy and commodity prices while the war and adverse developments associated with chinas zerocovid policy were both perceived as in creasing the risk that supply chain disruptions and pro duction constraints would be further exacerbated in the united states and abroad participants views on current conditions and the economic outlook in conjunction with this fomc meeting participants submitted their projections of the most likely outcomes for real gdp growth the unemployment rate and infla tion for each year from through and over the longer run based on their individual assessments of ap propriate monetary policy including the path of the fed eral funds rate the longerrun projections represented each participants assessment of the rate to which each variable would be expected to converge over time un der appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of page federal open market committee further shocks to the economy a summary of eco nomic projections sep was released to the public fol lowing the conclusion of the meeting in their discussion of current economic conditions par ticipants noted that overall economic activity appeared to have picked up after edging down in the first quarter job gains had been robust in recent months and the un employment rate had remained low inflation remained elevated reflecting supply and demand imbalances re lated to the pandemic higher energy prices and broader price pressures participants recognized that the inva sion of ukraine by russia was causing tremendous hu man and economic hardship for the ukrainian people participants judged that the invasion and related events were creating additional upward pressure on inflation and were weighing on global economic activity in ad dition participants indicated that covidrelated lock downs in china were likely to exacerbate supply chain disruptions against this background participants stated that they were highly attentive to inflation risks with regard to the economic outlook participants noted that recent indicators suggested that real gdp growth was expanding in the current quarter with consumption spending remaining strong participants generally judged that growth in business fixed investment ap peared to be slowing and activity in the housing sector appeared to be softening in part as a result of a sharp rise in mortgage rates correspondingly participants in dicated that they had revised down their projections of real gdp growth for this year consistent with ongoing supply chain disruptions and tighter financial conditions participants noted that the imbalance between supply and demand across a wide range of product markets was contributing to upward pressure on inflation they saw an appropriate firming of monetary policy and associ ated tighter financial conditions as playing a central role in helping address this imbalance and in supporting the federal reserves goals of maximum employment and price stability an easing of supply bottlenecks a further rise in labor force participation and the waning effects of pandemicrelated fiscal policy support were cited as additional factors that could help reduce the supply demand imbalances in the economy and therefore lower inflation over the next few years that said the timing and magnitude of these effects were uncertain partici pants saw little evidence to date of a substantial improve ment in supply constraints and some of them judged that the economic effects of these constraints were likely to persist longer than they had previously anticipated participants stressed the need to adjust the stance of pol icy in response to incoming information regarding the evolution of these and other factors in their discussion of the household sector participants indicated that consumption spending had remained ro bust in part reflecting strong balance sheets in the household sector and a tight labor market several par ticipants noted that household spending patterns ap peared to be shifting away from goods to services sev eral participants indicated that some of their contacts re ported that the pace of consumer spending though strong was beginning to moderate one reason cited for this moderation was that the purchasing power of households was being reduced by higher prices for food energy and other essentials participants generally ex pected higher mortgage interest rates to contribute to further declines in home sales and a couple of partici pants noted that housing activity in their districts had begun to slow noticeably against the backdrop of rising borrowing costs and higher gasoline and food prices a couple of participants commented that consumer senti ment had dropped notably in june according to the pre liminary reading in the michigan survey with respect to the business sector participants ob served that their contacts generally reported that sales remained strong although some contacts indicated that sales had begun to slow and that they had become less optimistic about the outlook in many industries the ability of firms to meet demand continued to be limited by labor shortages and supply chain bottlenecks firms relying on international sources for their inputs were seen as encountering particularly acute supply chain dis ruptions supply constraints labor shortages and rising input costs were also reportedly limiting energy and ag ricultural producers ability to take advantage of the higher prices of their products by investing and expand ing their production capacity similarly a few partici pants noted that in other sectors of the economy their contacts reported that they were postponing investment or construction projects because of rising input and fi nancing costs with supply challenges still widespread contacts continued to assess that supply constraints overall were significant and many of them judged that these constraints were likely to persist for some time participants noted that the demand for labor continued to outstrip available supply across many parts of the economy they observed that various indicators pointed to a very tight labor market these indicators included an unemployment rate near a year low job vacancies at historical highs and elevated nominal wage minutes of the meeting of june page growth additionally most business contacts had con tinued to report persistent wage pressures as well as dif ficulties in hiring and retaining workers however some contacts reported that because of previous wage hikes hiring and retention had improved and pressure for ad ditional wage increases appeared to be receding employment growth while moderating somewhat from its pace earlier in the year had remained robust several participants observed that labor force participation re mained below its prepandemic level because of the un usually large number of retirements during the pandemic and judged that the labor force participation rate was un likely to move up considerably in the near term a cou ple of participants raised the possibility that tight labor markets would spur investment in automation by firms boosting labor productivity while labor markets were anticipated to remain tight in the near term participants expected labor demand and supply to come into better balance over time helping to ease upward pressure on wages and prices as in the case of product markets they anticipated that an appro priate firming of monetary policy would play a central role in helping address imbalances in the labor market with the tightness in labor markets anticipated to dimin ish over time participants generally expected the unem ployment rate to increase as the median projection of the unemployment rate in the june sep showed a grad ual rise over the next few years reaching percent in in light of the very high level of job vacancies a number of participants judged that the expected moder ation in labor demand relative to supply might primarily affect vacancies and have a less significant effect on the unemployment rate participants noted that inflation remained much too high and observed that it continued to run well above the committees longerrun percent objective with to tal pce prices having risen percent over the months ending in april they also observed that the month change in the cpi in may came in above ex pectations participants were concerned that the may cpi release indicated that inflation pressures had yet to show signs of abating and a number of them saw it as solidifying the view that inflation would be more persis tent than they had previously anticipated they com mented on the hardship caused by elevated inflation with low and moderateincome households especially affected these households had to spend more of their budgets on essentials such as food energy and housing and were less able to bear the rapidly rising costs of these essentials in that context some participants noted that their contacts had reported that low and moderate income consumers were shifting purchases to lowercost goods participants also stressed that persistently high inflation would impede the achievement of maximum employment on a sustained basis participants judged that strong aggregate demand to gether with supply constraints that had been larger and longer lasting than expected continued to contribute to price pressures across a broad array of goods and ser vices they noted that the surge in prices of oil and other commodities associated with russias invasion of ukraine was boosting gasoline and food prices and put ting additional upward pressure on inflation partici pants commented on the global nature of inflation pres sures and a few of them added that many foreign central banks were also firming the stance of monetary policy several participants judged that a shift in spending from goods to services was likely to be associated with less upward pressure on prices in the goods sector but also an intensification of upward pressure on prices in the services sector participants had revised up their pce inflation projections for in their june sep submis sions largely in response to higherthanexpected infla tion readings and the slower anticipated resolution of supply constraints they expected that the appropriate firming of monetary policy and an eventual easing of supply and demand imbalances would bring inflation back down to levels roughly consistent with the com mittees longerrun objectives by and keep longer term inflation expectations well anchored participants observed that some measures of inflation expectations had moved up recently including the staff index of common inflation expectations and the expec tations of inflation over the next to years provided in the michigan survey with respect to marketbased measures however a few participants noted that me diumterm measures of inflation compensation fell over the intermeeting period and longerterm measures were unchanged while measures of longerterm inflation ex pectations derived from surveys of households profes sional forecasters and market participants were gener ally judged to be broadly consistent with the commit tees longerrun percent inflation objective many par ticipants raised the concern that longerrun inflation ex pectations could be beginning to drift up to levels incon sistent with the percent objective these participants noted that if inflation expectations were to become unanchored it would be more costly to bring inflation back down to the committees objective page federal open market committee in their discussion of risks participants emphasized that they were highly attentive to inflation risks and were closely monitoring developments regarding both infla tion and inflation expectations most agreed that risks to inflation were skewed to the upside and cited several such risks including those associated with ongoing sup ply bottlenecks and rising energy and commodity prices participants judged that uncertainty about economic growth over the next couple of years was elevated in that context a couple of them noted that gdp and gross domestic income had been giving conflicting signals re cently regarding the pace of economic growth making it challenging to determine the economys underlying mo mentum most participants assessed that the risks to the outlook for economic growth were skewed to the down side downside risks included the possibility that a fur ther tightening in financial conditions would have a larger negative effect on economic activity than antici pated as well as the possibilities that the russian invasion of ukraine and the covidrelated lockdowns in china would have largerthanexpected effects on economic growth in their consideration of the appropriate stance of mon etary policy participants concurred that the labor market was very tight inflation was well above the committees percent inflation objective and the nearterm inflation outlook had deteriorated since the time of the may meet ing against this backdrop almost all participants agreed that it was appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate basis points at this meeting one participant favored a basis point increase in the target range at this meeting instead of basis points all par ticipants judged that it was appropriate to continue the process of reducing the size of the federal reserves bal ance sheet as described in the plans for reducing the size of the federal reserves balance sheet that the committee issued in may in light of elevated inflation pressures and signs of deterioration in some measures of inflation expectations all participants reaffirmed their strong commitment to returning inflation to the com mittees percent objective participants observed that a return of inflation to the percent objective was nec essary for creating conditions conducive to a sustainably strong labor market over time in discussing potential policy actions at upcoming meet ings participants continued to anticipate that ongoing increases in the target range for the federal funds rate would be appropriate to achieve the committees objec tives in particular participants judged that an increase of or basis points would likely be appropriate at the next meeting participants concurred that the eco nomic outlook warranted moving to a restrictive stance of policy and they recognized the possibility that an even more restrictive stance could be appropriate if ele vated inflation pressures were to persist participants noted that with the federal funds rate ex pected to be near or above estimates of its longerrun level later this year the committee would then be well positioned to determine the appropriate pace of further policy firming and the extent to which economic devel opments warranted policy adjustments they also re marked that the pace of rate increases and the extent of future policy tightening would depend on the incoming data and the evolving outlook for the economy many participants noted that the committees credibility with regard to bringing inflation back to the percent objec tive together with previous communications had been helpful in shifting market expectations of future policy and had already contributed to a notable tightening of financial conditions that would likely help reduce infla tion pressures by restraining aggregate demand partici pants recognized that ongoing policy firming would be appropriate if economic conditions evolved as expected at the current juncture with inflation remaining well above the committees objective participants remarked that moving to a restrictive stance of policy was required to meet the committees legislative mandate to promote maximum employment and price stability in addition such a stance would be appropriate from a risk manage ment perspective because it would put the committee in a better position to implement more restrictive policy if inflation came in higher than expected many partici pants judged that a significant risk now facing the com mittee was that elevated inflation could become en trenched if the public began to question the resolve of the committee to adjust the stance of policy as war ranted on this matter participants stressed that appro priate firming of monetary policy together with clear and effective communications would be essential in re storing price stability participants remarked that developments associated with russias invasion of ukraine the covidrelated lockdowns in china and other factors restraining supply conditions would affect the inflation outlook and that it would likely take some time for inflation to move down to the committees percent objective participants also judged that maintaining a strong labor market during the process of bringing inflation down to percent would depend on many factors affecting demand and supply participants recognized that policy firming could slow minutes of the meeting of june page the pace of economic growth for a time but they saw the return of inflation to percent as critical to achieving maximum employment on a sustained basis committee policy action in their discussion of monetary policy for this meeting members agreed that overall economic activity appeared to have picked up after edging down in the first quarter job gains had been robust in recent months and the un employment rate had remained low members also agreed that inflation remained elevated reflecting supply and demand imbalances related to the pandemic higher energy prices and broader price pressures members concurred that the invasion of ukraine by russia was causing tremendous human and economic hardship members agreed that the invasion and related events were creating additional upward pressure on in flation and were weighing on global economic activity with the effects of the invasion of ukraine by russia already materializing members considered it appropriate to omit from the june statement the sentence conveying the high uncertainty associated with the implications of the invasion for the us economy members also agreed that covidrelated lockdowns in china were likely to exacerbate supply chain disruptions in light of these developments members remarked that they remain highly attentive to the upside risks to inflation and would be nimble in responding to incoming data and the evolv ing outlook in their assessment of the monetary policy stance neces sary for achieving the committees maximumemploy ment and pricestability goals the committee decided to raise the target range for the federal funds rate to to percent and anticipated that ongoing increases in the target range would be appropriate in addition mem bers agreed that the committee would continue reduc ing its holdings of treasury securities and agency debt and agency mbs as described in the plans for reducing the size of the federal reserves balance sheet that were issued in may one member preferred to raise the target range for the federal funds rate basis points to to percent at this meeting members judged that with high and widespread infla tion pressures and some measures of longerterm infla tion expectations moving up somewhat it would be ap propriate for the postmeeting statement to note that the committee was strongly committed to returning infla tion to its percent objective as the further firming in the policy stance would likely result in some slowing in economic growth and tempering in labor market condi tions members also agreed to remove the previous state ment language that had indicated an expectation that ap propriate policy would result in a return of inflation to percent and a strong labor market members agreed that in assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy they would continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook and that they would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate in the event that risks emerged that could impede the attainment of the committees goals they also concurred that their assessments would take into account a wide range of in formation including readings on public health labor market conditions inflation pressures and inflation ex pectations and financial and international develop ments at the conclusion of the discussion the committee voted to authorize and direct the federal reserve bank of new york until

advisor federal reserve bank of minneapolis federico mandelman research economist and advisor federal reserve bank of atlanta developments in financial markets and open market operations the deputy manager turned first to a discussion of fi nancial market developments financial markets over the intermeeting period reflected elevated uncertainty about the outlook most market participants appeared to view a moderation of inflation and slower but still positive economic growth ahead as the most likely sce nario however investors appeared to be increasingly attentive to downside risks to the economy in light of the potential for shocks from abroad and the continued upside surprises to inflation on net financial conditions eased modestly over the pe riod but remained substantially tighter than at the start of the year treasury yields fell reflecting expectations of slower growth as well as a decline in inflation com pensation respondents to the open market desks sur veys of primary dealers and market participants marked down their growth forecasts for and and at tached higher odds than in the june survey to the possi bility that the us economy could enter a recession in coming quarters market participants perceived falling commodity pricesparticularly for oiland the fomcs commit ment to bringing inflation down as pointing to lower in flation ahead marketbased measures of neardated in flation compensation declined and continued to suggest that inflation would ease in coming quarters in the desk surveys respondents also expected inflation to de cline substantially in but assigned meaningful prob abilities to a wide range of potential outcomes including scenarios involving continued elevated rates of inflation farforward marketbased measures of inflation com attended from the discussion of the economic and financial situation through the end of wednesdays session page federal open market committee pensation fell over the period these measures contin ued to suggest that inflation would return over time to the committees percent objective in their assessment of the policy outlook market partic ipants expected significant policy tightening in coming meetings as the committee continued to respond to the current elevated level of inflation nearly all respond ents to the desk survey anticipated a basis point in crease in the target range at the current meeting and most expected a basis point increase in september to follow the marketimplied path of the federal funds rate indicated a peak policy rate of around percent significantly lower than at the time of the june meeting the marketimplied path suggested expectations that the policy rate would fall thereafter most respondents to the desk survey expected the federal funds rate to re main above the surveys longerrun policy rate of percent through the end of but on average re spondents placed significant probabilities on lower rate outcomes regarding developments abroad central banks in ad vanced foreign economies afes had quickened the pace of policy tightening in order to address abovetar get inflation eight advancedeconomy central banks raised their policy rates over the period along lines sim ilar to us developments marketimplied policy rates in most afes fell at longer horizons and reflected expec tations that policy rates would reach peak levels by early in contrast to central banks in other advanced economies the bank of japan confirmed its commit ment to accommodative policy in this environment the exchange value of the dollar appreciated further surpas sing its march peak against advancedeconomy currencies the deputy manager next turned to a discussion of money markets and desk operations the basis point increase in the target range at the june meeting passed through fully to the federal funds rate and other over night rates although downward pressure on overnight secured rates had persisted the pronounced softness ob served in the past intermeeting period had abated to some degree the overnight reverse repurchase agree ment on rrp facility continued to support policy im plementation and balances remained elevated the dep uty manager anticipated that in the near term the evo lution of takeup at the on rrp facility would continue to depend on changes in the supply of safe shortterm investments and the demand for such investments by money market mutual funds mmmfs on rrp bal ances were expected to decline over time as balance sheet runoff proceeded the deputy manager noted that this process would involve adjustments across a number of markets and that the staff would continue to monitor developments in money markets closely regarding expectations for the evolution of the federal reserves balance sheet market participants expected the committee to increase the monthly caps on system open market account soma redemptions beginning in september as announced in the plans for reducing the size of the federal reserves balance sheet issued in may treasury coupon principal payments would first fall below the billion cap in september with the re mainder of redemptions met with maturities of treasury bills paydowns of agency mortgagebacked securities mbs were projected to fall below the higher septem ber cap of billion beginning in september the deputy manager ended with an update on soma net income staff projections suggested that net income would likely turn negative in coming months that de velopment would be reflected in a temporary deferred asset on reserve bank balance sheets any deferred as set would not affect the committees ability to imple ment monetary policy and the deferred asset would be extinguished over time as net income turned positive again in later years by unanimous vote the committee ratified the desks domestic transactions over the intermeeting period there were no intervention operations in foreign curren cies for the systems account during the intermeeting pe riod staff review

sharp contraction in china and russias war against ukraine took a toll on foreign activity especially in europe in dicators for june showed the chinese economy re bounding as the lockdowns were eased the global economy however continued to face headwinds from disruptions to the supply of energy elevated political un certainties in europe and tighter global monetary and financial conditions

reflecting the decline in global commodity prices in domestic credit markets longerterm borrowing costs for households and businesses with higher credit ratings declined over the intermeeting period but borrowing costs for lower rated firms were higher on net the credit quality of businesses municipalities and house holds remained stable credit remained generally avail able though credit availability appeared to tighten for most businesses and for some households borrowing costs linked to shorterterm interest rates generally increased largely as a result of expectations of tighter monetary policy bank interest rates for both commercial and industrial ci and commercial real es tate cre loans increased in may and were close to pre pandemic levels yields on institutional leveraged loans and newly issued commercial mortgagebacked securi ties cmbs increased amid financial market volatility and growing concerns about an economic slowdown small businesses that borrow on a regular basis faced notably higher borrowing costs in june interest rates on most existing credit card accounts and on auto loans continued to trend upward in contrast to many other borrowing rates residential mortgage rates fell since the june fomc meeting in line with the drop in longer term yields but remained near their highest levels since the credit quality of nonfinancial corporations remained strong with low volumes of defaults on corporate bonds in may and on leveraged loans in june the volume of rating downgrades on speculativegrade credit in the cor porate bond market was similar to that of upgrades in june while for leveraged loans the volume of down grades exceeded the volume of upgrades in may and june the credit quality for ci and cre loans on banks books remained sound however respondents in the july senior loan officer opinion survey on bank lending practices sloos indicated increased con cerns about credit quality in the near future as reasons for their expectation of a tightening in lending standards over the second half of delinquency rates on cre loans in cmbs declined in june delinquency rates on small business loans were little changed and the credit quality of municipal securities remained strong the credit quality of households stayed solid residential mortgage delinquencies and the share of mortgages in forbearance trended down credit card and auto credit delinquency rates rose somewhat over the first quarter but remained subdued by recent historical standards business loans at banks expanded at a rapid pace in may and june despite higher interest rates and a more uncer tain economic outlook ci loans on banks books con tinued to grow robustly with the july sloos citing rea sons of increased demand by customers to finance in ventory and accounts receivable however issuance of both agency and nonagency cmbs slowed significantly in june credit appeared to be available to most small businesses although the share of small firms reporting that it was difficult to obtain loans increased credit in the residential mortgage market remained widely availa ble for borrowers with higher credit ratings but tight for households with low credit scores volumes of home purchase mortgage originations declined in may and mortgage refinance volumes continued to fall con sumer credit remained broadly available to households in april and may but respondents in the federal reserve bank of new yorks survey of consumer expectations indicated that it was harder to get credit in recent months that said auto loans outstanding continued to grow at a robust pace in april and may but credit card balances moderated somewhat in may and june the staff provided an update on its assessment of the stability of the financial system and on balance charac terized the vulnerabilities of the us financial system as moderate down from notable in january equity and corporate debt prices declined significantly since the last assessment reflecting concerns over slower minutes of the meeting of july page growth and lower risk appetite in corporate markets declining risk appetite has also led to sharp declines in the price of some digital assets the staff noted that dig ital assets tended to be volatile the staff also high lighted the financial stability considerations associated with rapid growth in stablecoins including their vulner ability to runs and the opacity of many aspects of their operations residential real estate prices continued to rise and the staff noted that although valuations have been elevated mortgage underwriting standards have been stronger than in previous houseprice cycles cre prices continued to rise and valuation pressures ap peared to be increasing the staff assessed that households were in a better posi tion than in the mids to weather a downturn in house prices noting that mortgage debt growth has sig nificantly lagged growth in house prices leaving house holds with substantial equity cushions moreover for much of the past decade most new mortgage debt had been added by borrowers with prime credit scores in addition the staff assessed that business leverage was high but businesses maintained ample cash on hand and their credit quality remained strong further the ability of most firms to service their debt was at a historically high level as measured by the interest coverage ratio the staff assessed that leverage in the financial sector remained moderate recent declines in bank capital ra tios were due to higher volatility interest rate increases and loan growth but the recently concluded stress tests suggested that participating banks could absorb losses from a severe recession without breaching regulatory minimums and some banks were expected to increase their capital ratios later this year leverage at hedge funds and life insurance companies remained relatively high market liquidity had deteriorated in the oil and equities markets since january but market functioning continued to be orderly yields offered by mmmfs were well above those offered by banks and the staff noted that this yield differential would attract inflows to mmmfs noting the structural vulnerabilities associated with mmmfs the staff highlighted the need to monitor the size and fragility of this sector and the progress of the security and exchange commissions recently proposed reforms the staff noted that openend bond and loan mutual funds which are also vulnerable to largescale in vestor withdrawals had experienced outflows as interest rates rose these outflows had proceeded in an orderly manner staff economic outlook the projection for us economic activity prepared by the staff for the july fomc meeting was noticeably weaker than the june forecast reflecting the economys reduced momentum and current and prospective finan cial conditions that were expected to provide less sup port to aggregate demand growth as a result while the projected level of real gdp remained above potential this year the gap was expected to have closed by the sec ond half of similarly the unemployment rate was projected to start rising in the second half of and to reach the staffs estimate of its natural rate at the end of next year total pce price inflation was expected to be percent in and core inflation was expected to be per cent core pce price inflation was expected to step down to percent in and to percent in the projected deceleration in core prices was attributable to the anticipated resolution of supplydemand imbal ances a labor market that was expected to become less tight over the projection period and a projected decline in import price inflation total pce inflation was ex pected to decline to percent in and to per cent in reflecting the anticipated slowing in core inflation and a projected rapid deceleration in consumer food and energy prices in coming quarters the staff continued to judge that the risks to the baseline projection for real activity were skewed to the downside noting that supply chain bottlenecks russias war against ukraine weak incoming data on spending and the tightening in financial conditions since the start of the year supported this assessment the staff viewed the risks to the inflation projection as skewed to the upside given the persistent upward surprises seen in the infla tion data the possibility that inflation expectations would become unanchored as a result of the large in crease in actual inflation over the past year and the risk that supply conditions would not improve as much as the baseline projection assumed participants views on current conditions and the economic outlook in their discussion of current economic conditions par ticipants noted that recent indicators of spending and production had softened nonetheless job gains had been robust in recent months and the unemployment rate had remained low inflation remained elevated re flecting supply and demand imbalances related to the pandemic higher food and energy prices and broader price pressures participants recognized that russias war against ukraine was causing tremendous human and page federal open market committee economic hardship participants judged that the war and related events were creating additional upward pressure on inflation and were weighing on global economic ac tivity against this background participants stated that they were highly attentive to inflation risks with regard to current economic activity participants noted that consumer expenditures housing activity business investment and manufacturing production had all decelerated from the robust rates of growth seen in the labor market however remained strong participants observed that indicators of spending and production suggested that the second quarter of this year had seen a broadbased softening in economic activity many participants remarked that some of the slowing particularly in the housing sector reflected the emerging response of aggregate demand to the tightening of finan cial conditions associated with the ongoing firming of monetary policy the unwinding of the largescale sup port to consumer spending provided by pandemicre lated fiscal policy actions the inflationinduced reduc tion in real disposable income and the move down in the demand for some products from the elevated levels seen in earlier stages of the pandemic had also all led to slower growth in households expenditures in addition a deterioration in the foreign economic outlook and a strong dollar were contributing to a weakening of exter nal demand participants anticipated that us real gdp would expand in the second half of the year but many expected that growth in economic activity would be at a belowtrend pace as the period ahead would likely see the response of aggregate demand to tighter financial conditions become stronger and more broad based par ticipants noted that a period of belowtrend gdp growth would help reduce inflationary pressures and set the stage for the sustained achievement of the commit tees objectives of maximum employment and price sta bility in their discussion of the household sector participants commented that they were seeing many signs in the data and hearing reports from business contacts of slower growth in consumer spending although the aggregate balance sheet for the household sector was strong and the unemployment rate was low consumer sentiment had deteriorated and households were reportedly be coming more cautious in their expenditure decisions in light of uncertainty about the economic outlook and the reduction in purchasing power induced by price rises particularly increases in the prices of essentials such as food housing and transportation participants also ob served that housing activity had weakened notably re flecting the impact of higher mortgage interest rates and house prices on home affordability participants antici pated that this slowdown in housing activity would con tinue and also expected higher borrowing costs to lead to a slowing in other interestsensitive household ex penditures such as purchases of durable goods with respect to the business sector participants noted that investment spending had likely declined in the sec ond quarter in addition business survey data and infor mation received from contacts indicated that manufac turing orders and production had fallen in some dis tricts heightened uncertainty concerns about inflation tighter financial conditions and a cutback in consumer spending had led firms to downgrade economic pro spects some participants noted that their contacts were reporting that businesses were in the process of reevalu ating their capital expenditure plans though a few par ticipants stated that some contacts had reported a degree of shortterm momentum in business activity arising from existing orders and from the implementation of ex pansion plans made before the tightening of financial conditions a few participants indicated that some busi ness contacts had assessed that demand and supply were beginning to come into better balance even so con tacts in many areas continued to report major supply chain disruptions and anticipated that these were likely to continue while also indicating that there were signs of improvement in supply conditions in some areas participants observed that the labor market remained strong with the unemployment rate very low job vacan cies and quits close to historically high levels and an el evated rate of nominal wage growth many participants also noted however that there were some tentative signs of a softening outlook for the labor market these signs included increases in weekly initial unemployment insurance claims reductions in quit rates and vacancies slower growth in payrolls than earlier in the year and reports of cutbacks in hiring in some sectors in addi tion although nominal wage growth remained strong ac cording to a wide range of measures there were some signs of a leveling off or edging down in some districts contacts had suggested that labor demandsupply imbal ances might be diminishing with firms being more suc cessful in hiring and retaining workers and under less pressure to raise wages some participants noted that the contribution that increases in labor supply could make to reducing labor market imbalances was likely limited especially as the scope for labor force participa tion to pick up was constrained by the ongoing move ment of the large babyboom cohort into their retire ment years while others highlighted factors holding down participation that could wane in the future such minutes of the meeting of july page as continuing pandemicrelated concerns participants observed that in part because of tighter financial condi tions and an associated moderation in the growth of ag gregate demand growth in employment would likely slow further in the period ahead they noted that this development would help bring labor demand and supply into better balance reducing upward pressures on nom inal wage growth and aiding the return of inflation to percent several participants observed that the mod eration in labor market conditions might well lag the slowdown in economic activity participants remarked that a moderation in labor market conditions would likely involve a decline in the number of job openings as well as a moderate increase in unemployment from the current very low rate a couple of participants indicated that firms were keen to retain workersa factor that could limit the increase in layoffs associated with a slow ing labor market participants noted that indicators of spending and pro duction pointed to less underlying strength in economic activity than was suggested by indicators of labor market activity with employment growth still strong the weak ening in spending data implied unusually large negative readings on labor productivity growth for the year so far participants remarked that the strength of the labor mar ket suggested that economic activity may be stronger than implied by the current gdp data with several par ticipants raising the possibility that the discrepancy might ultimately be resolved by gdp being revised up ward several participants also observed however that the labor market might not be as tight as some indicators suggested and they noted that data provided by the pay roll processor adp and employment as reported in the household survey both seemed to imply a softer labor market than that suggested by the stillrobust growth in payroll employment as reported in the establishment survey participants observed that inflation remained unaccept ably high and was well above the committees longer run goal of percent in light of the high cpi reading for june participants noted that pce inflation was likely to have increased further in that month participants further observed that inflationary pressures were broad based a pattern reflected in large onemonth increases in the trimmed mean cpi and core cpi measures par ticipants remarked that although recent declines in gas oline prices would likely help produce lower headline in flation rates in the short term declines in the prices of oil and some other commodities could not be relied on as providing a basis for sustained lower inflation as these prices could quickly rebound participants also noted that the high cost of living was an especially great burden on low and middleincome households partic ipants agreed that there was little evidence to date that inflation pressures were subsiding they judged that in flation would respond to monetary policy tightening and the associated moderation in economic activity with a delay and would likely stay uncomfortably high for some time participants also observed that in some product categories the rate of price increase could well pick up further in the short run with sizable additional increases in residential rental expenses being especially likely participants noted that supply bottlenecks were contin uing to contribute to price pressures there were how ever some signs of gradual improvement in the supply situationincluding improved availability of certain key materials less upward pressure on input prices and a de cline in delivery times contacts reported that there were nevertheless substantial continuing challenges partici pants judged that it would take considerable time for supply constraints to be resolved and a few suggested that full resolution of supply difficulties would take longer than they previously assessed several partici pants stressed that improvements in supply would be helpful but by themselves could not be relied on to re solve the supply and demand imbalances in the economy sufficiently rapidly participants emphasized that a slow ing in aggregate demand would play an important role in reducing inflation pressures they expected that the ap propriate firming of monetary policy and an eventual easing of supply and demand imbalances would bring in flation back down to levels consistent with the commit tees longerrun objective and keep longerterm inflation expectations well anchored participants discussed a number of factors likely to be helpful in bringing infla tion back down to percent in addition to the com mittees ongoing policy firming and anchored longer term inflation expectations these included competitive pressures restraining price increases the apparent ab sence of a wageprice spiral the tightening of monetary policy abroad and the impact of the appreciation of the dollar on import prices however they continued to view commodity price developments as a potential source of upward pressure on inflation participants noted that expectations of inflation were an important influence on the behavior of actual inflation and stressed that moving to an appropriately restrictive stance of policy was essential for avoiding an unanchor ing of inflation expectations such an unanchoring would make achieving the committees statutory objec tives of maximum employment and price stability much more difficult in assessing the current state of inflation page federal open market committee expectations participants noted that recent readings on marketbased measures of inflation compensation were consistent with longerterm inflation expectations re maining anchored near percent they judged that this behavior of longerterm inflation expectations was likely partly due to the actual and expected firming of mone tary policy and also likely reflected downward revisions to the growth of aggregate demand expected in coming years in addition several participants assessed that the committees ongoing monetary policy tightening was helping alleviate concerns among market participants and wage and price setters that elevated inflation would become entrenched several participants observed that recent readings on survey measures of inflation expecta tions were broadly consistent with the committees percent longerrun inflation objective although a few participants noted that household surveys were indicat ing increasing divergences in views about the likely longerrun rate of inflation in their discussion of risks participants emphasized that they were highly attentive to inflation risks and were closely monitoring developments regarding both infla tion and inflation expectations uncertainty about the mediumterm course of inflation remained high and the balance of inflation risks remained skewed to the upside with several participants highlighting the possibility of further supply shocks arising from commodity markets participants saw the risks to the outlook for real gdp growth as primarily being to the downside these down side risks included the possibility that the tightening in financial conditions would have a larger negative effect on economic activity than anticipated that there would be further pandemicrelated economic disruptions or that geopolitical and global economic developments would lead to additional adverse economic or financial disturbances several of the participants who commented on issues re lated to financial stability noted that on balance asset valuations had eased from elevated levels in recent months high levels of capital and liquidity overall in the banking system healthy household balance sheets and the adoption of stronger mortgage underwriting standards following the global financial crisis were also cited among the factors that fostered financial stability in the current environment several participants noted that financial market liquidity had been low in some ar eas but that market functioning had nonetheless been orderly several participants emphasized the importance of avoiding complacency when assessing financial vul nerabilities amid everchanging economic and financial landscapes or the need to look at a broad range of pos sible outcomes including scenarios involving elevated inflation and rising interest rates when assessing finan cial vulnerabilities and stability some participants com mented on the financial stability challenges posed by dig ital assets they noted that these assets including sta blecoins were subject to vulnerabilitiessuch as runs fire sales and excessive leveragesimilar to those asso ciated with more traditional assets while the recent tur moil in digital asset markets had not spread to other asset classes these participants saw digital assets rising im portance and growing interconnectedness with other segments of the financial system as underscoring the need to establish a robust supervisory and regulatory framework for this industry that would appropriately limit potential systemic risks a few participants men tioned the need to strengthen the oversight and regula tion of certain types of nonbank financial institutions several participants noted that capital at some of the largest banks had declined in recent quarters these par ticipants emphasized that it was important that the larg est banks have strong capital positions and that appro priate settings of regulatory and supervisory tools can help deliver that outcome a couple of these partici pants highlighted the potential role that usage of the countercyclical capital buffer could play in this context in their consideration of the appropriate stance of mon etary policy participants concurred that the labor market was very tight and that inflation was far above the com mittees percent inflation objective participants noted that recent indicators of spending and production had softened while by contrast job gains had been robust and the unemployment rate had remained low against this backdrop all participants agreed that it was appro priate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate basis points at this meeting and to continue the pro cess of reducing the federal reserves securities hold ings as described in the plans for reducing the size of the federal reserves balance sheet that the committee issued in may participants observed that following this meetings policy rate hike the nominal federal funds rate would be within the range of their estimates of its longerrun neutral level even so with inflation elevated and expected to remain so over the near term some par ticipants emphasized that the real federal funds rate would likely still be below shorterrun neutral levels after this meetings policy rate hike in discussing potential policy actions at upcoming meet ings participants continued to anticipate that ongoing increases in the target range for the federal funds rate minutes of the meeting of july page would be appropriate to achieve the committees objec tives with inflation remaining well above the commit tees objective participants judged that moving to a re strictive stance of policy was required to meet the com mittees legislative mandate to promote maximum em ployment and price stability participants concurred that the pace of policy rate increases and the extent of future policy tightening would depend on the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook and risks to the outlook participants judged that as the stance of monetary policy tightened further it likely would become appropriate at some point to slow the pace of policy rate increases while assessing the effects of cumulative policy adjustments on economic activity and inflation some participants indicated that once the policy rate had reached a sufficiently restrictive level it likely would be appropriate to maintain that level for some time to ensure that inflation was firmly on a path back to percent participants concurred that in expeditiously raising the policy rate the committee was acting with resolve to lower inflation to percent and anchor inflation expec tations at levels consistent with that longerrun goal participants noted that the committees credibility with regard to bringing inflation back to the percent objec tive together with its forceful policy actions and com munications had already contributed to a notable tight ening of financial conditions that would likely help re duce inflation pressures by restraining aggregate de mand participants pointed to some evidence suggesting that policy actions and communications about the future path of the federal funds rate were starting to affect the economy most visibly in interestsensitive sectors par ticipants generally judged that the bulk of the effects on real activity had yet to be felt because of lags associated with the transmission of monetary policy and that while a moderation in economic growth should support a re turn of inflation to percent the effects of policy firm ing on consumer prices were not yet apparent in the data a number of participants posited that some of the effects of policy actions and communications were showing up more rapidly than had historically been the case because the expeditious removal of policy accom modation and supporting communications already had led to a significant tightening of financial conditions in light of elevated inflation and the upside risks to the outlook for inflation participants remarked that moving to a restrictive stance of the policy rate in the near term would also be appropriate from a riskmanagement per spective because it would better position the committee to raise the policy rate further to appropriately restric tive levels if inflation were to run higher than expected participants judged that a significant risk facing the committee was that elevated inflation could become en trenched if the public began to question the committees resolve to adjust the stance of policy sufficiently if this risk materialized it would complicate the task of return ing inflation to percent and could raise substantially the economic costs of doing so many participants re marked that in view of the constantly changing nature of the economic environment and the existence of long and variable lags in monetary policys effect on the econ omy there was also a risk that the committee could tighten the stance of policy by more than necessary to restore price stability these participants highlighted this risk as underscoring the importance of the commit tees datadependent approach to judging the pace and magnitude of policy firming over coming quarters participants reaffirmed their strong commitment to re turning inflation to the committees percent objective participants agreed that a return of inflation to the per cent objective was necessary for sustaining a strong labor market participants remarked that it would likely take some time for inflation to move down to the commit tees objective participants added that the course of in flation would be influenced by various nonmonetary fac tors including developments associated with russias war against ukraine and with supply chain disruptions participants recognized that policy firming could slow the pace of economic growth but they saw the return of inflation to percent as critical to achieving maximum employment on a sustained basis committee policy action in their discussion of monetary policy for this meeting members agreed that recent indicators of spending and production had softened members also concurred that nonetheless job gains had been robust in recent months and the unemployment rate had remained low mem bers agreed that inflation remained elevated reflecting supply and demand imbalances related to the pandemic higher food and energy prices and broader price pres sures in describing the sources of elevated inflation members judged it pertinent to add a reference to higher food prices to the statement because of the notable rise in these prices and the importance of food items in households budgets members concurred that russias war against ukraine was causing tremendous human and economic hardship they also agreed that the war and related events were creating additional upward pressure on inflation and page federal open market committee were weighing on global economic activity members remarked that they remained highly attentive to inflation risks amid evidence that covidrelated lockdowns in china had generally been lifted and had affected supply chains only modestly members generally considered it appropriate to omit from the july statement the sentence that appeared in the june statement indicating that these lockdowns were likely to exacerbate supply chain disrup tions in their assessment of the monetary policy stance neces sary for achieving the committees maximumemploy ment and pricestability goals the committee decided to raise the target range for the federal funds rate to to percent and anticipated that ongoing increases in the target range would be appropriate in addition mem bers agreed that the committee would continue reduc ing the federal reserves holdings of treasury securities and agency debt and agency mbs as described in the plans for reducing the size of the federal reserves bal ance sheet that were issued in may members agreed that in assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy they would continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook and that they would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate in the event that risks emerged that could impede the attainment of the committees goals they also concurred that their assessments would take into account a wide range of in formation including readings on public health labor market conditions inflation pressures and inflation ex pectations and financial and

federal open market committee rebecca zarutskie special adviser to the board division of board members board andrei zlate group manager division of monetary affairs board developments in financial markets and open market operations the manager pro tem turned first to a discussion of fi nancial market developments over the intermeeting pe riod us financial conditions tightened over the period largely reflecting an upward revision in investors out look for the path of the policy rate treasury yields climbed substantially with most of the upward move re flected in real yields equity prices initially rose amid secondquarter earnings reports that were better than feared but later retraced those gains in response to the shifting policy outlook regarding international devel opments yields in most advanced foreign economies afes also rose sharply as a number of other central banks lifted policy rates and indicated in their communi cations that they would likely continue to tighten mone tary policy in order to address inflation pressures the exchange value of the dollar appreciated notably reach ing multidecade highs in real terms as market partici pants perceived mounting economic challenges abroad the marketimplied path of the federal funds rate shifted sharply higher after market participants interpreted fed eral reserve communicationsparticularly those pro vided at the jackson hole symposiumalong with in coming data as indicating a more restrictive path of pol icy than previously expected policysensitive rates sug gested that a basis point increase in the target range for the federal funds rate was widely expected to be de cided on at the committees september meeting with some chance of a basis point move in addition the marketimplied path suggested reasonable odds of addi tional basis point and basis point rate increases at the november and december meetings respectively market participants generally anticipated a further slow ing in the pace of rate increases after december with the peak policy rate being reached in the first half of beyond that period the marketimplied path of the fed eral funds rate sloped downward likely reflecting down side risks to the policy rate path the median respond ent to the open market desk surveys expected the pol icy rate path to remain flat through after the peak rate was reached on average desk survey respondents assigned an almost percent probability to a decline in real gross domestic product gdp over nearly double the probability assigned in the july survey the manager pro tem turned next to a discussion of pol icy implementation balance sheet runoff had continued to proceed smoothly over the intermeeting period with caps on redemptions of treasury securities and agency mortgagebacked securities mbs doubling in septem ber the pace of balance sheet runoff was set to increase over coming months the markets for treasury securi ties and agency mbs continued to function in an orderly manner though liquidity conditions in both markets re mained low reflecting elevated interest rate uncertainty in money markets the basis point increase in the tar get range at the july meeting passed through fully to overnight rates amid strong demand for shortterm in vestments takeup at the overnight reverse repurchase agreement on rrp facility was relatively steady at el evated levels the staff continued to anticipate that on rrp takeup would decline in coming quarters from its currently ele vated levels as money market participants responded to shifting conditions issuance of shortterm securities was likely to increase in coming periods and as more clarity emerged in the economic and policy outlook de mand for shortterm assets could moderate both of these developments would ease downward pressure on yields on safe shortterm investments the gradual re duction in on rrp balances could also be facilitated by rising competition among banks in seeking deposits the manager pro tem indicated that the staff would con tinue to monitor money market developments closely in order to assess whether any frictions were emerging in this process the manager pro tem concluded with an update on op erational matters as expected federal reserve net in come turned negative in september the staff expected that the size of the associated deferred asset would in crease over time until net income turned positive likely in a few years the desk planned to begin aggregation of those agency mbs held in the system open market account soma that are not eligible to be commingled into uniform mbs and specifically the freddie mac mbs that were issued before june and have a day payment delay decisions about any additional ag gregations would be made at a later date by unanimous vote the committee ratified the desks domestic transactions over the intermeeting period there were no intervention operations in foreign curren cies for the systems account during the intermeeting pe riod minutes of the meeting of september page staff review of the economic situation the information available at the time of the septem ber meeting suggested that us real gdp was in creasing at a modest pace in the third quarter after hav ing declined over the first half of the year labor de mand remained strong and the labor market continued to be very tight recent monthly readings indicated that consumer price inflationas measured by the month percentage change in the price index for personal con sumption expenditures pceremained elevated total nonfarm payroll employment posted robust gains in july and august at an average pace that was only slightly below what was seen over the first half of the year the unemployment rate edged up on net from percent in june to percent in august the unem ployment rate for african americans increased over this period while the rate for hispanics moved up slightly on net both rates were noticeably higher than the national average the labor force participation rate and employmenttopopulation ratio both rose on net from june to august the privatesector job openings rate as measured by the job openings and labor turnover sur vey moved slightly lower from may to july but remained at a high level nominal wage growth continued to be rapid and broad based average hourly earnings rose percent over the months ending in august while the employment cost index of hourly compensation in the private sector which also includes benefit costs rose percent over the months ending in june per centage points faster than the yearearlier pace consumer price inflation remained elevated total pce price inflation was percent over the months end ing in july and core pce price inflation which excludes changes in consumer energy prices and many consumer food prices was percent over the same period the trimmed mean measure of month pce price infla tion constructed by the federal reserve bank of dallas was percent in july in august the month change in the consumer price index cpi was percent while core cpi inflation was percent over the same period surveybased measures of shortrun inflation expecta tions declined in recent weeks while measures of longer term inflation expectations remained roughly stable or moved lower available spending indicators including the august re tail sales report suggested that real pce was on track to post a modest gain in the third quarter however the latest housing market data pointed to another sharp con traction in residential investment in the third quarter and business fixed investment appeared to be rising at a tepid pace real goods exports stepped up in june and then rose fur ther in july led by increases in exports of industrial sup plies by contrast real goods imports stepped down in june and then fell sharply in july driven by a large de cline in consumer goods imports exports and imports of services continued to be held back by an incomplete recovery of international travel the nominal us inter national trade deficit continued to narrow in june and july altogether net exports contributed positively to gdp growth in the second quarter and appeared on track to make another positive contribution in the third quarter data pointed to weak foreign growth in recent months weighed down by the global reverberations from rus sias war against ukraine and a loss of momentum in the chinese economy in europe further disruptions to the supply of energy exacerbated declines in real disposable incomes and in consumer and business confidence re straining economic activity in china recent indicators suggest only a partial rebound from the effects of earlier severe covidrelated lockdowns as well as increas ing concerns about the property sector weaker growth in china and the broader global economy also weighed on exportoriented emerging market economies in asia consumer price inflation rose further in august in many foreign economies reflecting past increases in energy and food prices but also a continued broadening of in flationary pressure to core prices with inflation persis tently high many central banks continued to tighten monetary policy staff review of the financial

august municipal bond yields in creased across ratings categories borrowing costs for residential mortgage loans increased and reached their highest levels since interest rates on most credit card accounts continued to move higher in line with the rise in the federal funds rate and auto loan interest rates rose steadily through august credit remained generally available to businesses and households but high borrowing costs appeared to re duce the demand for credit resulting in lower financing volumes in some markets issuance of nonfinancial cor porate bonds slowed further in july from the weak levels seen in the second quarter but rebounded somewhat in august and so far in september gross institutional lev eraged loan issuance increased modestly in july from subdued levels but continued to be weak in august eq uity issuance remained depressed while issuance of mu nicipal bonds was sluggish over the summer and so far in september according to the july senior loan officer opinion sur vey on bank lending practices banks tightened credit standards on ci lending for the first time in two years but ci loans on banks balance sheets expanded at a strong pace in july and august reflecting strong demand from nonfinancial businesses cre loans on banks bal minutes of the meeting of september page ance sheets also continued to grow robustly but issu ance of commercial mortgagebacked securities cmbs slowed in july from its strong pace earlier in the year credit availability to small businesses appeared to be tightening somewhat the share of small firms reporting that it was more difficult to obtain loans continued its upward trend in august but remained lower than its his torical average credit in the residential mortgage market remained avail able for highcreditscore borrowers credit availability for lowcreditscore borrowers continued to ease through july but remained modestly tightclose to pre pandemic averages however the volumes of both homepurchase and refinance mortgage originations plunged in july amid rising mortgage rates consumer credit remained available to most households in june and july but about half of the respondents in the federal reserve bank of new yorks survey of consumer ex pectations indicated that it was harder to obtain credit than it was a year earlier and that they expected it to be come even harder over the next year the credit quality of nonfinancial corporations remained generally strong with low default rates for both corpo rate bonds and leveraged loans the volume of rating upgrades in the corporate bond market outpaced that of downgrades in july and august but so far in september these relative volumes reversed the volume of rating downgrades in the leveraged loan market continued to exceed that of upgrades credit quality for ci and cre loans on banks balance sheets also remained sound as delinquency rates remained at low levels through june however banks increased loan loss pro visions somewhat in the second quarter delinquency rates on cre loans securitized into cmbs remained un changed in july delinquency rates on small business loans stayed quite low after edging up and the credit quality of municipal securities remained strong household credit quality stayed broadly solid but con tinued to worsen for some types of credit owed by bor rowers with low credit scores mortgage delinquencies trended down in recent months and the share of mort gages in foreclosure remained low in july by contrast credit card and auto credit delinquency rates rose over the second quarter particularly among subprime bor rowers with subprime auto loan delinquency rates re bounding notably to slightly above their historical aver ages staff economic outlook the projection for us economic activity prepared by the staff for the september fomc meeting was slightly weaker than the july forecast however the staffs esti mate of potential output in recent history was revised down significantly in response to continued disappoint ing productivity growth and the sluggish gains in labor force participation seen so far this year moreover this lower trajectory for potential output was expected to persist throughout the forecast period as a result the staffs estimate of the output gap was revised up consid erably this year and while the staff projection still had the output gap closing in coming years the level of out put was expected to be slightly above potential at the end of likewise the unemployment rate was expected to rise more slowly than in the july projection and to be slightly below the staffs estimate of its natural rate at the end of on a month change basis total pce price inflation was expected to be percent in and core infla tion was expected to be percent although the staff continued to project that core inflation would step down over the next two yearsreflecting the anticipated reso lution of supplydemand imbalances and a labor market that was expected to become less tightcore inflation was revised up in each year of the projection in core inflation was expected to be percent total pce price inflation was expected to decline to per cent in as core inflation slowed and energy prices declined total pce inflation was expected to move down further in to percent and to remain at percent in the staff continued to judge that the risks to the baseline projection for real activity were skewed to the downside in addition to russias war in ukraine weakening activ ity abroad and ongoing supply chain bottlenecks the possibility that a persistent reduction in inflation could require a greaterthanassumed amount of tightening in financial conditions was viewed by the staff as a salient downside risk to their forecast for real activity the staff viewed the risks to the inflation projection as skewed to the upside on the grounds that supply conditions might not improve as much as expected and energy prices might rise sharply again the staff also pointed to the possibility that wage increases could put a greaterthan expected amount of upward pressure on price inflation and the possibility that inflation expectations could be come unanchored given the large rise in inflation seen over the past year as additional upside risks to the infla tion forecast page federal open market committee participants views on current conditions and the economic outlook in conjunction with this fomc meeting participants submitted their projections of the most likely outcomes for real gdp growth the unemployment rate and infla tion for each year from through and over the longer run based on their individual assessments of ap propriate monetary policy including the path of the fed eral funds rate the longerrun projections represented each participants assessment of the rate to which each variable would be expected to converge over time un der appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy a summary of eco nomic projections was released to the public following the conclusion of the meeting in their discussion of current economic conditions par ticipants noted that recent indicators had pointed to modest growth in spending and production job gains had been robust in recent months and the unemploy ment rate had remained low inflation remained ele vated reflecting supply and demand imbalances related to the pandemic higher food and energy prices and broader price pressures participants recognized that russias war against ukraine was causing tremendous human and economic hardship participants judged that the war and related events were creating additional up ward pressure on inflation and were weighing on global economic activity against this background participants remained highly attentive to inflation risks with regard to the economic outlook participants noted that recent data pointed to modest growth in economic activity over the second half of this year participants observed that recent indicators of consumer spending and business investment suggested modest increases in those spending categories but noted that activity in in terestsensitive sectors weakened appreciably partici pants revised down their projections of real gdp growth for this year from their projections in june sev eral participants noted that the continued strength in the labor market as well as the data on gross domestic in come raised the possibility that the current gdp data could understate the strength in economic activity this year participants generally anticipated that the us economy would grow at a belowtrend pace in this and the coming few years with the labor market becoming less tight as monetary policy assumed a restrictive stance and global headwinds persisted participants noted that a period of belowtrend real gdp growth would help reduce inflationary pressures and set the stage for the sustained achievement of the committees objectives of maximum employment and price stability in their discussion of the household sector participants noted that consumer spending grew moderately reflect ing strength in the labor market the elevated level of household savings accumulated during the pandemic and a strong aggregate householdsector balance sheet several participants noted that spending appeared to have held up relatively well especially among higherin come households these participants also noted that the composition of spending by lowtomoderateincome householdswho were affected to a greater degree by high food energy and shelter priceswas changing with discretionary expenditures being cut and purchases shifting to lowercost options participants observed that the notable slowdown in residential investment and other interestsensitive spending had continued reflect ing the effect of the committees monetary policy ac tions and tighter financial conditions with regard to the business sector participants observed that growth in investment spending appeared modest several participants mentioned that manufacturing activ ity had slowed a couple of participants noted that busi nesses were constrained in undertaking new capital pro jects as they faced higher financing costs persistent challenges associated with supply bottlenecks and hiring difficulties resulting from the continued tightness of the labor market participants discussed how they perceived challenging supply conditions to be evolving many participants re marked that their business contacts were reporting signs of relief in supply bottlenecks such as declines in ship ping costs and delivery times and rising inventories while several participants saw little improvement in the supply situation participants saw supply bottlenecks as likely continuing for a while longer and a couple com mented that constraints on production were increasingly taking the form of labor shortages rather than parts shortages participants observed that the labor market had re mained very tight as evidenced by a historically low un employment rate elevated job vacancies and quit rates a low pace of layoffs robust employment gains and high nominal wage growth a few participants remarked that employers facing particularly acute labor shortages were those associated with professional occupations service industries skilled trades and smaller firms some par ticipants noted a number of developments consistent with the labor market moving toward better balance in cluding a lower rate of job turnover a moderation in em ployment growth and an increase in the labor force par ticipation rate for primeage workers however several minutes of the meeting of september page participants assessed that the scope for further improve ment in labor force participation was likely limited es pecially in view of the sizable contribution that retire ments had made to the previous decline in the participa tion rate participants anticipated that the supply and demand im balances in the labor market would gradually diminish and the unemployment rate would likely rise somewhat importantly reflecting the effects of tighter monetary policy participants judged that a softening in the labor market would be needed to ease upward pressures on wages and prices participants expected that the transi tion toward a softer labor market would be accompanied by an increase in the unemployment rate several com mented that they considered it likely that the transition would occur primarily through reduced job vacancies and slower job creation a couple of participants re marked that in light of challenges in hiring businesses might be less willing to reduce their staffing levels in the event of a weakening in general economic activity a few participants particularly stressed the high uncer tainty associated with the expected future path of the un employment rate and commented that the unemploy ment rate could rise by considerably more than in the staff forecast participants observed that inflation remained unaccept ably high and well above the committees longerrun goal of percent participants commented that recent inflation data generally had come in above expectations and that correspondingly inflation was declining more slowly than they had previously been anticipating price pressures had remained elevated and had persisted across a broad array of product categories energy prices had declined in recent months but remained con siderably higher than in and upside risks to energy prices remained several participants noted the contin ued elevated rates of increase in core goods prices these participants considered this development as po tentially indicating that the shift of household spending from goods to services might be having a smaller effect on goods prices than they expected or that the supply bottlenecks and labor shortages were taking longer to be resolved participants commented that they expected in flation pressures to persist in the near term numerous contributing factors were cited as supporting this view including labor market tightness and the resulting up ward pressure on nominal wages continuing supply chain disruptions and the persistent nature of increases in services prices particularly shelter prices with respect to the medium term participants judged that inflation pressures would gradually recede in com ing years various factors were cited as likely to contrib ute to this outcome including the committees tighten ing of its policy stance a gradual easing of supply and demand imbalances in labor and product markets and the likelihood that weaker consumer demand would re sult in a reduction of business profit margins from their current elevated levels a few participants reported that business contacts in certain retail sectorssuch as used cars and apparelwere planning to cut prices in order to help reduce their inventories several participants commented that while households across the income distribution were burdened by elevated inflation those at the lower end of the income distribution were partic ularly harmed as a larger share of their income was spent on housing and other necessities in assessing inflation expectations participants noted that longerterm expectations appeared to remain well anchored as reflected in a broad range of surveys of households businesses and forecasters as well as measures obtained from financial markets participants remarked that the committees affirmation of its strong commitment to its pricestability objective together with its forceful policy actions had likely helped keep longer run inflation expectations anchored some stressed that a more prolonged period of elevated inflation would in crease the risk of inflation expectations becoming unan chored making it much more costly to bring inflation down a few participants discussed the increased dis persion of longerterm inflation expectations across re spondents in various surveys with an increase in the number of respondents reporting relatively low expecta tions of future inflation acknowledged as a key driver of the increased dispersion but with a couple of participants citing higher inflation expectations among some survey respondents as a cause for concern and a reason not to be complacent about longerterm inflation expectations remaining well anchored participants agreed that the uncertainty associated with their economic outlooks was high and that risks to their inflation outlook were weighted to the upside some participants noted rising labor tensions a new round of global energy price increases further disruptions in sup ply chains and a largerthanexpected passthrough of wage increases into price increases as potential shocks that if they materialized could compound an already challenging inflation problem a number of participants commented that a wageprice spiral had not yet devel oped but cited its possible emergence as a risk page federal open market committee participants broadly judged the risks to real gdp growth to be weighted to the downside with various global headwinds most prominently cited as contributing fac tors these global headwinds included heightened risk of recession in europe a slowdown in economic activity occurring in china and the ongoing global economic implications of russias war against ukraine several participants noted that the monetary policy tightening under way in many other economies would affect global financial markets and foreign real gdp growth with the potential for spillovers to the us economy in their consideration of the appropriate stance of mon etary policy participants concurred that the labor market was very tight and that inflation was far above the com mittees percent inflation objective participants ob served that recent indicators of production and spending had pointed to modest growth while job gains had been robust and the unemployment rate had remained low against this backdrop all participants agreed that it was appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate basis points at this meeting and to continue the process of reducing the federal reserves securities holdings as described in the plans for reducing the size of the federal reserves balance sheet that the commit tee issued in may policymakers observed that the rate hike at this meeting was another step toward making the committees monetary policy stance sufficiently restric tive to help ease supply and demand imbalances and to bring inflation back to percent participants reaffirmed their strong commitment to returning inflation to the committees percent objective with many stressing the importance of staying on this course even as the la bor market slowed in discussing potential policy actions at upcoming meet ings participants continued to anticipate that ongoing increases in the target range for the federal funds rate would be appropriate to achieve the committees objec tives participants judged that the committee needed to move to and then maintain a more restrictive policy stance in order to meet the committees legislative man date to promote maximum employment and price stabil ity many participants noted that with inflation well above the committees percent objective and showing little sign so far of abating and with supply and demand imbalances in the economy continuing they had raised their assessment of the path of the federal funds rate that would likely be needed to achieve the committees goals participants judged that the pace and extent of policy rate increases would continue to depend on the implica tions of incoming information for the outlook for eco nomic activity and inflation and on risks to the outlook several participants noted that particularly in the current highly uncertain global economic and financial environ ment it would be important to calibrate the pace of fur ther policy tightening with the aim of mitigating the risk of significant adverse effects on the economic outlook participants observed that as the stance of monetary policy tightened further it would become appropriate at some point to slow the pace of policy rate increases while assessing the effects of cumulative policy adjust ments on economic activity and inflation many partici pants indicated that once the policy rate had reached a sufficiently restrictive level it likely would be appropri ate to maintain that level for some time until there was compelling evidence that inflation was on course to re turn to the percent objective participants noted that in keeping with the committees plans for reducing the size of the federal reserves balance sheet balance sheet runoff had moved up to its maximum planned pace in september and would continue at that pace they further observed that a significant reduction in the committees holdings of securities was in progress and that this process was contributing to the move to a re strictive policy stance a couple of participants re marked that after the process of balance sheet reduction was well under way it would be appropriate for the committee to consider sales of agency mbs in order to enable suitable progress toward a longerrun soma portfolio composed primarily of treasury securities in their assessment of the effects of policy actions and communications to date participants concurred that the committees actions to raise expeditiously the target range for the federal funds rate demonstrated its resolve to lower inflation to percent and to keep inflation ex pectations anchored at levels consistent with that longer run goal participants noted that the committees com mitment to restoring price stability together with its pur poseful policy actions and communications had con tributed to a notable tightening of financial conditions over the past year that would likely help reduce inflation pressures by restraining aggregate demand participants observed that this tightening had led to substantial in creases in real interest rates across the maturity spec trum most participants remarked that although some interestsensitive categories of spendingsuch as hous ing and business fixed investmenthad already started to respond to the tightening of financial conditions a sizable portion of economic activity had yet to display much response they noted also that inflation had not yet responded appreciably to policy tightening and that a significant reduction in inflation would likely lag that minutes of the meeting of september page of aggregate demand participants observed that a pe riod of real gdp growth below its trend rate very likely accompanied by some softening in labor market condi tions was required they agreed that by moving its pol icy purposefully toward an appropriately restrictive stance the committee would help ensure that elevated inflation did not become entrenched and that inflation expectations did not become unanchored these policy moves would therefore prevent the far greater economic pain associated with entrenched high inflation including the even tighter policy and more severe restraint on eco nomic activity that would then be needed to restore price stability in light of the broadbased and unacceptably high level of inflation the intermeeting news of higherthan expected inflation and upside risks to the inflation out look participants remarked that purposefully moving to a restrictive policy stance in the near term was consistent with riskmanagement considerations many partici pants emphasized that the cost of taking too little action to bring down inflation likely outweighed the cost of tak ing too much action several participants underlined the need to maintain a restrictive stance for as long as nec essary with a couple of these participants stressing that historical experience demonstrated the danger of prem aturely ending periods of tight monetary policy designed to bring down inflation several participants observed that as policy moved into restrictive territory risks would become more twosided reflecting the emergence of the downside risk that the cumulative restraint in ag gregate demand would exceed what was required to bring inflation back to percent a few of these partic ipants noted that this possibility was heightened by fac tors beyond the committees actions including the tightening of monetary policy stances abroad and the weakening global economic outlook that were also likely to restrain domestic economic activity in the period ahead committee policy action in their discussion of monetary policy for this meeting members agreed that recent indicators had pointed to modest growth in spending and production members also concurred that job gains had been robust in recent months and the unemployment rate had remained low members agreed that inflation remained elevated re

that in assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy they would continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook and that they would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerged that could impede the attainment of the committees goals they also noted that their assessments would take into account a wide range of information including readings on public health labor market conditions in flation pressures and inflation expectations and financial and international developments members affirmed that the committee

policy decisions there was agreement that the federal re serve can be effective only when there is a foundation of public trust participants reaffirmed the importance of holding themselves and their staffs accountable for knowing and following the high ethical standards that are set in the committees policies including those on financial transactions and disclosure and on external communications developments in financial markets and open market operations the manager pro tem turned first to a discussion of fi nancial market developments in the united states over page federal open market committee the period financial conditions had tightened amid ele vated volatility across financial markets the marketim plied path of the policy rate rose with the median federal funds rate values in the september summary of eco nomic projections and other federal reserve communi cations being viewed by market participants as indicating a commitment to sustaining a restrictive monetary policy stance with data received over the period also indicat ing higherthanexpected core inflation market partici pants placed high odds on a basis point increase in the target range at the current meeting nonetheless contacts were increasingly focused on the question of when the committee might slow the pace of future in creases in light of the substantial tightening of financial conditions that had occurred over the year most re spondents to the open market desks surveys viewed a basis point increase in the target range for the federal funds rate at the december meeting as the most likely outcome on net nominal treasury yields ended the period higher reflecting both an upward revision in the expected path of the policy rate and higher estimated term premiums investmentgrade bond yields and mortgage interest rates moved up as well to the highest levels in many years the manager pro tem turned next to a discussion of vol atility in global financial markets in september an ex pansionary budget announced by the uk government resulted in an extraordinary rise in yields on gilts long dated uk government securities and reduced gilt mar ket liquidity reflecting its financial stability objective the bank of england initiated a temporary gilt purchase program designed to address disorderly market condi tions these purchases and a subsequent cancellation of some announced expansionary uk budgetary measures resulted in a retracement of much of the earlier increase in gilt yields elevated volatility in international financial markets con tributed to volatility in us core fixedincome markets in markets for us treasury securities some measures of marketimplied volatility approached pandemicera levels spreads of yields on agency mortgagebacked se curities mbs over yields on treasury securities wid ened sharply reflecting the sensitivity of these spreads to increased volatility the increased volatility appeared to contribute to a decline in measures of market liquidity in core fixedincome markets in particular around the period associated with uk volatility but market func tioning remained orderly the foreign exchange value of the dollar appreciated fur ther over the period market participants perceived sev eral asian economies as engaging in foreign exchange market interventions in response to rapid depreciations of local currencies in the case of advanced economies whose monetary policy tightening was well under way market participants focused on communications per ceived as signaling a potentially slower pace of policy rate increases in the period ahead the manager pro tem turned next to developments in money markets and federal reserve operations usage of the overnight reverse repurchase agreement on rrp facility remained fairly steady other than dur ing the period surrounding quarterend in the period ahead the relative pace of decline in on rrp facility balances and reserve balances would depend importantly on shifts in money market conditions recent develop ments including with regard to the relationship between on rrp facility balances and money market rates sug gested that over time conditions could evolve in a man ner that would lead to falling usage of the on rrp fa cility however the manager pro tem noted that money market conditions could change somewhat more quickly in the leadup to yearend because of normal factors

the second quarter indicated that credit card and auto credit delin quency rates continued to rise however delinquencies for auto loans were near their prepandemic levels and those for credit cards remained well below prepandemic levels the staff provided an update on its assessment of the stability of the financial system the staff noted that re spondents to the federal reserve bank of new yorks survey of nearterm risks judged that economic finan cial and geopolitical risks had risen across the globe amid this weaker outlook and higher interest rates prices of risky assets generally fell though real estate val uations remained elevated household borrowing was moderate and mortgage performance remained strong nonfinancial businesses leverage continued to decline and interest coverage ratios continued to increase how ever further increases in borrowing costs could pose risks to some borrowers ability to service their debts in the financial sector the results of this years stress test demonstrated that large banks remain resilient to a sub stantial economic downturn but there were indicators of elevated leverage at hedge funds and other nonbank financial institutions shortterm funding markets con tinued to have structural vulnerabilities funding risks at domestic banks remained low but prime money mar ket funds other cashinvestment vehicles openend mu tual funds and stablecoins all continued to be suscepti ble to disruptive redemptions staff economic outlook the projection for us economic activity prepared by the staff for the november fomc meeting was weaker than the september forecast broad financial conditions were expected to be considerably more restrictive over the projection period than in september reflecting both recent market moves and upward revisions to the staffs assumptions regarding the future course of monetary policy based on recent federal reserve communications as a result output was expected to move below the staffs estimate of potential early in and to remain below potential in likewise the unemployment rate was expected to be above the staffs estimate of its natural rate in and on a month change basis total pce price inflation was expected to be percent in and core inflation was expected to be percent the staff raised their projection for core pce price inflation in coming quar ters reflecting their assessment that the factors that had boosted inflation since the middle of last yearmost notably strong wage growth and the effect of supply constraints on priceswould persist for longer than previously thought with the effects of supplydemand imbalances in goods markets expected to unwind and la bor and product markets expected to become less tight the staff continued to project that inflation would de cline markedly over the next two years in both to tal and core pce price inflation were expected to be percent with inflation remaining stubbornly high the staff con tinued to view the risks to the inflation projection as skewed to the upside for real activity sluggish growth in real private domestic spending a deteriorating global outlook and tightening financial conditions were all seen as salient downside risks to the projection for real activ ity in addition the possibility that a persistent reduction in inflation could require a greaterthanassumed amount of tightening in financial conditions was seen as another downside risk the staff therefore continued to judge that the risks to the baseline projection for real activity were skewed to the downside and viewed the possibility that the economy would enter a recession sometime over the next year as almost as likely as the baseline participants views on current conditions and the economic outlook in their discussion of current economic conditions par ticipants noted that recent indicators pointed to modest growth of spending and production nonetheless job gains had been robust in recent months and the unem ployment rate had remained low inflation remained el evated reflecting supply and demand imbalances related to the pandemic higher food and energy prices and broader price pressures participants recognized that russias war against ukraine was causing tremendous human and economic hardship the war and related events were creating additional upward pressure on in flation and were weighing on global economic activity against this background participants continued to be highly attentive to inflation risks with regard to current economic activity and the near term outlook participants observed that although real gdp rebounded in the third quarter recent data sug gested that economic activity in the near term appeared likely to expand at a pace below its trend growth rate participants noted a softening in consumer and business spending growth and some participants remarked that page federal open market committee there had been a notable slowing in interest ratesensi tive sectors particularly housing in response to the tightening of financial conditions associated with the committees policy actions with inflation remaining far too high and showing few signs of moderating partici pants observed that a period of belowtrend real gdp growth would be helpful in bringing aggregate supply and aggregate demand into better balance reducing in flationary pressures and setting the stage for the sus tained achievement of the committees objectives of maximum employment and price stability in their discussion of the household sector participants noted that growth in consumer spending had softened recently several participants remarked that there had been a reduction in discretionary expenditures especially among lower and middleincome households whose purchases were shifting toward lowercost options par ticipants observed that in aggregate householdsector balance sheets were still strong and that this factor would continue to support consumer spending a few partici pants noted that some households had been running down the additional savings they had accumulated dur ing the pandemic and that there were reports of a rise in the number of households experiencing financial strains participants commented that higher mortgage interest rates had notably restrained housing activity with regard to the business sector participants noted that growth in investment spending was modest several participants observed that business investment was be ing weighed down by tighter financial conditions al though a few participants reported that some business contacts indicated that their investment spending had been resilient some participants mentioned reports re ceived from business contacts of easing supply bottle necks reflected in declines in shipping costs and delivery times although the reported extent of these improve ments varied across contacts a few participants re marked that in instances in which supply constraints had eased their business contacts found it easier to plan production or had diminished needs to maintain precau tionary inventories a couple of participants noted that drought conditions in the midwest were making some waterways notably the mississippi river system less navigable these conditions were creating new supply constraints and putting upward pressures on transporta tion costs and prices for farm products participants observed that with inflation elevated glob ally many central banks were tightening monetary policy simultaneously contributing to an overall tightening of global financial conditions participants further noted that the overall tightening of global financial conditions along with energy prices and other headwinds was con tributing to a slowdown in the growth rate of global real gdp participants remarked that the foreign economic slowdown in combination with a strong us dollar was likely to weigh on the us export sector and several par ticipants commented that there could be wider spillovers to the us economy participants observed that the labor market had re mained very tight with the unemployment rate near a historically low level the number of job vacancies very high a low pace of layoffs robust employment gains and elevated nominal wage growth some participants remarked that employers in certain sectors such as health care leisure and hospitality or construction faced particularly acute labor shortages and that these short ages were contributing to especially strong wage pres sures in those sectors participants commented on the labor market having remained strong to date even alongside the slowing in economic activity a number of participants remarked that some businesses were keen to retain workers after their recent experiences of labor shortages and hiring challenges these participants noted that this consideration had limited layoffs even as the broader economy had softened or that this behavior could limit layoffs if aggregate economic activity were to soften further nevertheless many participants noted tentative signs that the labor market might be moving slowly toward a better balance of supply and demand these signs included a lower rate of job turnover and a moderation in nominal wage growth participants antic ipated that imbalances in the labor market would gradu ally diminish and that the unemployment rate would likely rise somewhat from its current very low level while vacancies would likely fall participants agreed that inflation was unacceptably high and was well above the committees longerrun goal of percent some participants noted that the burden of high inflation was falling disproportionally on lowin come households for whom necessities like food en ergy and shelter make up a larger share of expenditures many participants observed that price pressures had in creased in the services sector and that historically price pressures in this sector had been more persistent than those in the goods sector some participants noted that the recent high pace of nominal wage growth taken to gether with the recent low pace of productivity growth would if sustained be inconsistent with achievement of the percent inflation objective several participants however commented on signs of a moderation in nom minutes of the meeting of november page inal wage growth participants agreed that nearterm in flation pressures were high but some noted that lower commodity prices or the expected reduced pressure on goods prices due to an easing of supply constraints should contribute to lower inflation in the medium term several participants remarked that rent increases on new leases had been slowing in recent months but partici pants also noted that it would take some time for this development to show up in pce inflation several par ticipants summarized reports provided by business con tacts about their firms ability to pass on higher input costs to their customers these reports suggested that some firms continued to have solid pricing power while in other cases cost passthrough had become more dif ficult participants remarked that overall measures of me dium and longerterm inflation expectations obtained from surveys of households and businesses as well as from financial markets quotes appeared to have re mained well anchored a couple of participants ob served that longerterm inflation expectations were sta ble even as measures of nearterm inflation expectations responded to realized inflation in line with historical pat terns participants noted that longerterm inflation ex pectations were an important influence on inflations be havior and stressed that the committees ongoing mon etary policy tightening would be essential for ensuring that these expectations remained well anchored several participants expressed the concern that the longer infla tion remained well above the percent goal the greater the risk that longerterm inflation expectations could be come unanchored such a development if it material ized would make it much more costly to bring inflation down and to achieve the committees statutory objec tives of maximum employment and price stability a couple of participants discussed the high dispersion of longerterm inflation expectations across respondents in various surveys these participants noted that the higher dispersion may signal increased uncertainty about the in flation outlook and was a reason not to be complacent about longerterm inflation expectations remaining well anchored participants discussed the length of the lags in the re sponse of the economy to monetary policy actions tak ing into account historical experience and the various es timates of timing relationships provided in economic re search as well as the high degree of uncertainty involved in applying the evidence on lags to the current situation they noted that monetary policy tightening typically produced rapid effects on financial conditions but that the full effects of changes in financial conditions on ag gregate spending and the labor market and then on in flation likely took longer to materialize with regard to current circumstances many participants remarked that even though the tightening of monetary policy had clearly influenced financial conditions and had had no table effects in some interest ratesensitive sectors the timing of the effects on overall economic activity the labor market and inflation was still quite uncertain with the full extent of the effects yet to be realized several participants observed that because of the difficulties in isolating the effects of monetary policy changes in eco nomic structure or increasing transparency over time re garding monetary policy decisions the historical record did not provide definitive evidence on the length of these lags in addition some participants noted that the postpandemic dynamics of the economy may differ from those prevailing prior to the pandemic participants generally noted that the uncertainty associ ated with their economic outlooks was high and that the risks to the inflation outlook remained tilted to the up side participants observed that recent inflation had been higher and more persistent than anticipated some participants noted the risk that energy prices could rise sharply again amid geopolitical tensions a few partici pants commented that the ongoing tightness in the labor market could lead to an emergence of a wageprice spi ral even though one had not yet developed a number of participants judged that the risks regarding the outlook for economic activity were weighted to the downside with various global headwinds being promi nently cited these global headwinds included a slow down in economic activity occurring in china and the ongoing international economic implications of russias war against ukraine participants observed that because of high inflation pressures prevailing globally monetary policy tightening was under way in many other econo miesa development likely to affect foreign economic activity and carrying the potential for spillovers to the us economy in their discussion of issues related to financial stability participants noted the importance of orderly functioning of the market for us treasury securities for the trans mission of monetary policy for meeting the financing needs of the federal government and for the operation of the global financial system participants observed that despite elevated interest rate volatility and indica tions of strained liquidity conditions the functioning of the treasury securities market had been orderly noting that the value of resilience of the market for treasury page federal open market committee securities was underlined by recent gilt market disrup tions in the united kingdom a number of participants discussed a range of issues that could be considered by the appropriate authorities regarding market resilience including potential interactions of capital and liquidity regulations with market activity oversight of key market participants clearing and settlement practices and the role and structure of the federal reserves standing fa cilities a few participants noted the importance of be ing prepared to address disruptions in us core market functioning in ways that would not affect the stance of monetary policy especially during episodes of monetary policy tightening several participants noted the risks posed by nonbank financial institutions amid the rapid global tightening of monetary policy and the potential for hidden leverage in these institutions to amplify shocks in their consideration of appropriate monetary policy ac tions at this meeting participants concurred that infla tion remained well above the committees longerrun goal of percent and the recent data on inflation pro vided very few signs that inflation pressures were abat ing the economic expansion had slowed significantly from last years rapid pace and recent indicators pointed to modest growth in spending and production in the cur rent quarter despite the slowdown in growth the labor market remained extremely tight and nominal wage growth remained elevated against this backdrop all participants agreed that it was appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate basis points at this meeting and to continue the process of reducing the federal reserves securities holdings as described in the plans for reducing the size of the federal reserves bal ance sheet that the committee issued in may partici pants observed that the policy rate hike at this meeting was another step toward making the committees mon etary policy stance sufficiently restrictive to help ease supply and demand imbalances and to return inflation to percent over time in their discussion of the effects of monetary policy ac tions and communications to date participants con curred that the committee had taken forceful steps to moderate aggregate demand in order to bring it into bet ter alignment with aggregate supply financial condi tions had tightened significantly in response to the com mittees policy actions and their effects were clearly ev ident in the most interest ratesensitive sectors of the economy including residential investment and some components of business investment several partici pants commented that monetary policy actions and communications had helped keep longerterm inflation expectations well anchoreda situation that would help facilitate the return of inflation to the committees longerrun goal of percent nevertheless with realized inflation well above that goal and the labor market still very tight participants agreed that ongoing increases in the target range for the federal funds rate would be ap propriate and would help keep longerterm inflation ex pectations well anchored participants noted that with regard to both real economic activity and inflation it would take time for the full effects of monetary restraint to be realized and that these lags complicated an assess ment of the effects of monetary policy in discussing potential policy actions at upcoming meet ings participants reaffirmed their strong commitment to returning inflation to the committees percent objec tive and they continued to anticipate that ongoing in creases in the target range for the federal funds rate would be appropriate in order to attain a sufficiently re strictive stance of policy to bring inflation down over time many participants commented that there was sig nificant uncertainty about the ultimate level of the fed eral funds rate needed to achieve the committees goals and that their assessment of that level would depend in part on incoming data even so various participants noted that with inflation showing little sign thus far of abating and with supply and demand imbalances in the economy persisting their assessment of the ultimate level of the federal funds rate that would be necessary to achieve the committees goals was somewhat higher than they had previously expected participants mentioned a number of considerations that would likely influence the pace of future increases in the target range for the federal funds rate these consider ations included the cumulative tightening of monetary policy to date the lags between monetary policy actions and the behavior of economic activity and inflation and economic and financial developments a number of participants observed that as monetary policy ap proached a stance that was sufficiently restrictive to achieve the committees goals it would become appro priate to slow the pace of increase in the target range for the federal funds rate in addition a substantial majority of participants judged that a slowing in the pace of in crease would likely soon be appropriate a slower pace in these circumstances would better allow the commit tee to assess progress toward its goals of maximum em ployment and price stability the uncertain lags and magnitudes associated with the effects of monetary pol icy actions on economic activity and inflation were among the reasons cited regarding why such an assess ment was important a few participants commented minutes of the meeting of november page that slowing the pace of increase could reduce the risk of instability in the financial system a few other partic ipants noted that before slowing the pace of policy rate increases it could be advantageous to wait until the stance of policy was more clearly in restrictive territory and there were more concrete signs that inflation pres sures were receding significantly with monetary policy approaching a sufficiently restric tive stance participants emphasized that the level to which the committee ultimately raised the target range for the federal funds rate and the evolution of the policy stance thereafter had become more important consider ations for achieving the committees goals than the pace of further increases in the target range participants agreed that communicating this distinction to the public was important in order to reinforce the committees strong commitment to returning inflation to the per cent objective participants discussed a number of riskmanagement considerations related to the conduct of monetary pol icy in light of the continuing broadbased and unac ceptably high level of inflation and upside risks to the inflation outlook participants remarked that purpose fully moving to a more restrictive policy stance was con sistent with riskmanagement considerations some par ticipants observed that there had been an increase in the risk that the cumulative policy restraint would exceed what was required to bring inflation back to percent several participants commented that continued rapid policy tightening increased the risk of instability or dis locations in the financial system there was wide agree ment that heightened uncertainty regarding the outlooks for both inflation and real activity underscored the im portance of taking into account the cumulative tighten ing of monetary policy the lags with which monetary policy affected economic activity and inflation and eco nomic and financial developments committee policy action in their discussion of monetary policy for this meeting

remained low members agreed that inflation had remained elevated reflecting supply and demand imbalances related to the pandemic higher food and energy prices and broader price pressures members

in the postmeeting statement on the grounds that this would underscore the committees view that a suffi ciently restrictive stance of monetary policy was needed for achieving its dualmandate goals members agreed that in determining the pace of future increases in the target range they would take into account the cumula tive tightening of monetary policy the lags with which monetary policy affected economic activity and inflation and economic and financial developments members agreed to add language to this effect in the postmeeting statement in order to convey explicitly the range of fac tors that they would consider in determining future monetary policy actions in addition members agreed that they would continue reducing the federal reserves holdings of treasury securities agency debt and agency mbs as described in the plans for reducing the size of the federal reserves balance sheet that were issued in may all members affirmed that they were strongly committed to returning inflation to its percent objec tive members agreed that in assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy they would continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook they would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerged that could impede the attainment of the committees goals members agreed that their assessments

to serve as deputy general counsel effective december until the first regularly scheduled meeting of the committee in developments in financial markets and open market operations the manager pro tem turned first to a discussion of de velopments in financial markets following several months of tightening financial conditions eased over the period as investor concerns about global risks edged lower and incoming data showed nascent signs of a moderation in inflationary pressures central bank com munications signaling a slower pace of policy rate in creases appeared to contribute to improved sentiment measures of implied volatility across financial markets declined somewhat from the elevated levels observed in october consistent with the decline in volatility modelbased measures suggested that a drop in term premiums accounted for much of the decline in treasury yields over the period equity markets moved higher however equity market contacts noted risks to growth ahead and earnings expectations for coming quarters had been marked down in foreign exchange markets moderating concerns about the potential for highly ele vated us interest rates spurred a depreciation in the foreign exchange value of the dollar in other market developments the manager pro tem noted the failure of a prominent cryptoasset exchange while the spillovers from this situation had been significant among other crypto lenders and exchanges the collapse was not seen as posing broader market risks to the financial system regarding the outlook for inflation in the united states inflation compensation implied by treasury inflation protected securities declined over the period respond ing to lowerthanexpected consumer price index cpi data and a sizable drop in oil prices however the desk surveybased measures of inflation expectations were lit tle changed from the prior survey suggesting that falling inflation risk premiums may have contributed to the moves both market and surveybased measures con tinued to point to expectations for a moderation of in flation over the coming year regarding the outlook for monetary policy both mar ket and desk surveybased measures indicated expecta tions for the committee to maintain elevated policy rates through in the december survey the median re spondents modal expectation for the path of the federal funds rate in shifted higher by basis points rela tive to the november survey the surveybased estimate of the expected policy path in continued to suggest a decline in the target range for the federal funds rate over little changed from the path anticipated in the november survey in contrast the marketimplied path of the federal funds rate in shifted down by as much as percentage point over the period likely re flecting declining risk premiums the manager pro tem turned next to a discussion of op erations and money markets and assessed that balance sheet runoff was proceeding smoothly repurchase agreement repo rates firmed modestly relative to the overnight reverse repurchase agreement on rrp fa cility rate over the period with balance sheet reduction reportedly contributing in part to an increase in the de mand for financing of treasury securities on rrp bal ances declined on net as money market funds shifted investments out of the on rrp facility reportedly in favor of higher rates available in repo markets in recent months banks continued to increase their use of wholesale funding in addition survey information suggested that banks expected to move deposit rates modestly higher relative to the target range in coming months over time greater competition among banks for funding could contribute to drawdowns in the on rrp facility staff indicated that they would con tinue to monitor money market conditions closely as bal ance sheet reduction proceeds looking ahead to year end market participants antici pated limited pressures the manager pro tem noted that if transitory pressures emerged in money markets the federal reserves backstop facilities are available to support effective policy implementation and smooth market functioning by unanimous vote the committee ratified the desks domestic transactions over the intermeeting period there were no intervention operations in foreign curren cies for the systems account during the intermeeting pe riod minutes of the meeting of december page staff review of the economic situation the information available at the time of the decem ber meeting suggested that us real gross domes tic product gdp was increasing at a modest pace in the fourth quarter of

in the price index for personal consumption expenditures pcestepped down in october but continued to be elevated total nonfarm payroll employment posted solid gains in october and november that were slower than the aver age monthly pace seen over the earlier part of the year the unemployment rate moved up percentage point to percent in october and remained at that rate in november on balance the unemployment rate for af rican americans edged down over those two months while the unemployment rate for hispanics increased slightly the unemployment rates for both groups re mained above the

the months ending in september com pensation per hour cph in the business sector rose percent over the four quarters ending in the third quarter but the reported increase likely understated the true pace of increase in cph as the lower secondquar ter employment data from the quarterly census of em ployment and wages had not yet been incorporated in the cph measure consumer price inflation remained elevated but had eased in recent months total pce price inflation was percent over the months ending in october percentage point below the september figure core pce price inflation which excludes changes in con sumer energy prices and many consumer food prices was percent over the months ending in october down percentage point from its september reading the trimmed mean measure of month pce price in flation constructed by the federal reserve bank of dal las remained at percent in october in november the month change in the cpi stepped down to percent and core cpi inflation dropped to per cent the cpi along with data from the producer price index pointed to a further slowing in pce price inflation in november a preliminary estimate of the staffs com mon inflation expectations index which combines infor mation from many indicators of inflation expectations and inflation compensation edged down in the fourth quarter but continued to be above prepandemic levels after expanding at a moderate pace in the third quarter real pce growth appeared to have picked up in the fourth quarter in contrast residential investment looked to be contracting sharply further and growth in business fixed investment seemed to be slowing mark edly with tepid gains in equipment and intangibles spending and continued declines in nonresidential struc tures investment manufacturing production increased only modestly in october and the available data pointed to a decline in november a decrease in factory output would be consistent with recent readings from national and regional manufacturing surveys which showed de clining new orders and a drawdown in order backlogs after narrowing in the third quarter the nominal us international trade deficit widened in october real goods exports fell led by declines in exports of industrial supplies and consumer goods real goods imports rose driven by increases in imports of industrial supplies which more than offset declines in imports of capital goods and consumer goods exports of services rose in part as travel exports continued to recover while im ports of services were little changed foreign economic activity grew at a moderate pace in the third quarter but more recent data pointed to weakening growth weighed down by the economic fallout of rus sias war against ukraine and a covidrelated slow down in china high inflation continued to contribute to a decline in real disposable incomes which together with disruptions to energy supplies depressed economic activity especially in europe in china authorities be gan to ease social restrictions even as covid cases surged raising the prospect of significant disruptions to economic activity in the near term but also a faster reo pening weaker global demand and high interest rates also weighed on activity in emerging market economies despite tentative signs of easing in foreign headline in flation core inflationary pressures remained elevated in page federal open market committee many countries in response to high inflation many cen tral banks further tightened monetary policy albeit at a slower pace in some cases staff review of the financial situation over the intermeeting period treasury yields and measures of inflation compensation declined on net and the implied path of the federal funds rate in ended modestly lower stock market indexes rose on balance likely reflecting reduced concerns about the in flation outlook and market volatility declined notably borrowing costs declined on net over the intermeeting period credit flows moderated a bit in recent months and the credit quality of businesses and most households remained solid the expected path of the federal funds rate implied by a straight read of financial market quotes ended the inter meeting period lower largely reflecting data releases that pointed to a largerthanexpected moderation in infla tion mediumtolongerterm nominal treasury yields declined substantially over the intermeeting period driven primarily by lowerthanexpected inflation data releases which appeared to prompt a substantial reduc tion in investors concerns about the possibility that in flation would remain high for a long period in line with those developments inflation compensation measures based on inflation swaps declined notably especially for shorter maturities broad stock price indexes

the recent firming in overnight repo rates net yields on money market funds rose further over the intermeeting period mostly passing through the increase in adminis tered rates while bank deposit rates increased only slightly in october and november foreign financial conditions broadly eased over the in termeeting period largely driven by lowerthanexpected us inflation data the foreign exchange value of the dollar depreciated against most foreign currencies par ticularly against those of advanced foreign economies in part reflecting a narrowing of nearterm yield differen tials between the united states and other advanced economies investors reacted positively to news of an easing of covid restrictions in china which drove risky asset prices significantly higher despite nearterm challenges associated with the health policy shift emerging market fund outflows moderated and turned to inflows later in the intermeeting period option implied volatility measures for exchange rates and benchmark foreign yields declined but remained ele vated by historical norms amid a high degree of uncer tainty around global inflation and the prospects for a re opening of the

for corporate bonds declined while borrowing costs for leveraged loans remained at an ele vated level bank interest rates for commercial and in dustrial ci loans continued to trend up in the third quarter municipal bond yields also decreased across rat ing categories residential mortgage rates fell on net after the november fomc meeting in contrast inter est rates in credit card offers continued to increase re flecting the higher prime rate that was quickly passed through interest rates on auto loans also rose steadily through november credit continued to be generally available to businesses and households but high borrowing costs appeared to weigh on financing volumes in many markets issuance of investmentgrade corporate bonds rebounded some what in late october and november from earlier sub dued levels while speculativegrade issuance remained soft new launches of leveraged loans picked up in no vember particularly for higherrated firms business loan originations continued to expand in octo ber and november but at a slower pace than observed in previous months ci loans continued to grow in october and november but decelerated relative to the thirdquarter pace moderating the robust rate of growth observed earlier this year nonetheless the volume of minutes of the meeting of december page ci lending remained solid overall commercial real es tate cre loans outstanding at commercial banks con tinued to increase in october and november but the recent pace was somewhat lower than in previous months in addition banks increased cre originations to multifamily and industrial properties relative to office properties reflecting caution in the context of rising of fice vacancies moreover commercial mortgagebacked securities cmbs issuance softened somewhat in octo ber amid elevated financing costs and tighter underwrit ing standards credit availability to small businesses ap peared to have tightened further this fall with the share of small firms reporting that it was more difficult to ob tain credit than three months earlier trending up through november credit was readily available in the residential mortgage market for highcreditscore borrowers who met stand ard conforming loan criteria credit availability for households with lower credit scores was considerably tighter at levels comparable with what prevailed before the pandemic the number of home purchases and re finance mortgage rate locks edged lower at subdued lev els despite recent declines in mortgage interest rates in contrast home equity lines of credit helocs grew notably in recent months on net potentially reflecting homeowners using helocs as a preferred way of ex tracting home equity in the presence of high mortgage rates consumer credit remained available for most con sumers through september with auto loans and credit card debt growing at a robust pace bank credit data also indicate that the expansion in credit card balances con tinued in october

november while for investmentgrade corporate bonds the volume of upgrades turned positive on net in november leveraged loans experienced net down grades in october but the pace of net downgrades slowed substantially in recent weeks default rates on corporate bonds and leveraged loans remained at very low levels however measures of expected default probabilities for corporate bonds and leveraged loans had increased from their levels at the beginning of the year in recent months overall the credit quality of mu nicipalities remained robust amid strong revenues at state and local governments the credit quality of busi nesses that borrow from banks remained sound on bal ance delinquencies on ci loans stayed flat and those on small businesses loans continued to edge up but de linquencies remained low relative to historical levels in addition the credit quality of nonagency cmbs loan borrowers deteriorated slightly with average delin quency rates ticking up in september and october driven by the office and retail sectors the credit quality of most households remained solid overall delinquencies on conventional mortgages con tinued to trend down through october while those on federal housing administration mortgages ticked up a bit from low levels in contrast delinquency rates for credit cards and auto loans continued to rise over the third quarter while delinquency rates on credit cards remained low relative to their historical range those on auto loans surpassed their prepandemic peak staff economic outlook the forecast for us economic activity prepared by the staff for the december fomc meeting was not as weak as the november projection recent data suggested that real gdp growth in the second half of was stronger than previously expected but economic growth was still forecast to slow markedly in from its sec ondhalf pace broad financial conditions were pro jected to be somewhat less restrictive than previously as sumed as the effects of a higher path for equity values and a lower path for the dollar more than offset a higher mediumterm trajectory for interest rates nevertheless the forecast for us real gdp growth through re mained subdued the staff slightly lowered its outlook for potential output reflecting a lower expected trend in labor force participation moreover the staff assumed a slower pace of decline in the natural rate of unemploy ment over the near term in response to recent estimates suggesting that jobmatching efficiency was not improv ing as fast as previously anticipated with all these changes output was expected to move below the staffs estimate of potential near the end of a year later than in the previous forecastand to remain below po tential in likewise the unemployment rate was expected to move above the staffs estimate of its natural rate near the end of and remain above it in on a fourquarter change basis total pce price inflation was expected to be percent in while core infla tion was expected to be percent both lower than in the november projection with the effects of supply demand imbalances in goods markets expected to un wind further and labor and product markets projected to become less tight the staff continued to forecast that in flation would decline markedly over the next two years core goods inflation was anticipated to slow further housing services inflation was expected to peak in and then move down while core nonhousing services page federal open market committee inflation was forecast to move down as wage growth eased in both total and core pce price inflation were expected to be near percent with inflation still elevated the staff continued to view the risks to the inflation projection as skewed to the up side moreover the sluggish growth in real private do mestic spending expected over the next year a subdued global economic outlook and persistently tight financial conditions were seen as tilting the risks to the downside around the baseline projection for real economic activ ity and the staff still viewed the possibility of a recession sometime over the next year as a plausible alternative to the baseline participants views on current conditions and the economic outlook in conjunction with this fomc meeting participants submitted their projections of the most likely outcomes for real gdp growth the unemployment rate and infla tion for each year from through and over the longer run based on their individual assessments of ap propriate monetary policy including the path of the fed eral funds rate the longerrun projections represented each participants assessment of the rate to which each variable would be expected to converge over time un der appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy a summary of eco nomic projections was released to the public following the conclusion of the meeting in their discussion of current economic conditions par ticipants noted that recent indicators pointed to modest growth of spending and production nonetheless job gains had been robust in recent months and the unem ployment rate had remained low inflation remained el evated reflecting supply and demand imbalances related to the pandemic higher food and energy prices and broader price pressures participants recognized that russias war against ukraine was causing tremendous human and economic hardship the war and related events were contributing to upward pressure on inflation and were weighing on global economic activity against this background participants continued to be highly at tentive to inflation risks participants observed that the growth of economic ac tivity had slowed significantly in from the previous years robust pace partly in response to the committees policy actions the effects of those actions were espe cially notable in interestsensitive sectors particularly housing participants remarked that although real gdp appeared to have rebounded moderately in the second half of after declining somewhat in the first half economic activity appeared likely to expand in at a pace well below its trend growth rate with inflation re maining unacceptably high participants expected that a sustained period of belowtrend real gdp growth would be needed to bring aggregate supply and aggregate de mand into better balance and thereby reduce inflationary pressures in their discussion of the household sector participants noted that growth in consumer spending in september and october had been stronger than they had previously expected likely supported by a strong labor market and households running down excess savings accumulated during the pandemic a couple of participants remarked that excess savings likely would continue to support con sumption spending for a while a couple of other par ticipants however commented that excess savings par ticularly among lowincome households appeared to be lower and declining more rapidly than previously thought or that the savings the majority of which ap peared to be held by higherincome households might continue to be largely unspent several participants re marked that budgets were stretched for lowtomoder ateincome households and that many consumers were shifting their spending to less expensive alternatives they also observed that many households were increas ingly using credit to finance spending overall partici pants assessed that there was considerable uncertainty around the consumer spending outlook participants commented that higher mortgage interest rates had no tably restrained housing activity and that they expected housing activity to remain weak a couple of partici pants remarked on anecdotes or concerns from builder contacts about contract cancellations by purchasers no longer able to qualify for loans at higher interest rates with regard to the business sector participants noted that growth in investment spending appeared modest and was being restrained by high borrowing costs and an outlook for slow growth of final demand although views on investment prospects varied across businesses and districts based on discussions with district con tacts as well as a survey of firms chief financial officers some participants commented that while businesses were generally optimistic about their own prospects they expressed increasing concern about the general eco nomic outlook for participants noted signs of continued easing in supply bottlenecks with a couple cit ing district contacts reports of declines in shipping costs and delivery times even so participants remarked that the improvements in supply chains had not been uniform and supply shortages remained for some types of goods participants also discussed the developments minutes of the meeting of december page in energy and agricultural sectors several participants commented that they saw diminished risks of severe dis ruption from the european unions embargo and the group of sevens price cap on russian oil exports a couple of participants noted that high costs for inputs like diesel feed and fertilizer were creating challenges for the agricultural sector participants observed that the labor market had re mained very tight with the unemployment rate near a historically low level robust payroll gains a high level of job vacancies and elevated nominal wage growth sev eral participants commented that there were tentative signs of labor market imbalances improving including declines in job openings and quits over the second half of as well as reports from district contacts that they were seeing more qualified job applicants for open positions than earlier in the year some participants pointed out that payroll gains had remained robust even as they slowed in recent months nevertheless they noted that some other measures of employmentsuch as those based on the bureau of labor statistics house hold survey and the quarterly census of employment and wagessuggested that job growth in may have been weaker than indicated by payroll employment participants generally concluded that there remained a large imbalance between labor supply and labor demand as indicated by the stilllarge number of job openings and elevated nominal wage growth participants com mented that labor demand had remained strong to date despite the slowdown in economic growth with a few remarking that some business contacts reported that they would be keen to retain workers even in the face of slowing demand for output because of their recent ex periences of labor shortages and hiring challenges with the labor force participation rate little changed since the beginning of some participants commented that labor supply appeared to be constrained by structural factors such as early retirements reduced availability or increased cost of childcare more costly transportation and reduced immigration under an appropriately re strictive path of monetary policy participants expected labor market supply and demand to come into better bal ance over time easing upward pressures on nominal wages and prices in the context of achieving the com mittees broadbased and inclusive maximumemploy ment goal a number of participants commented that as the labor market moved into better balance the unem ployment rate for some demographic groupsparticu larly african americans and hispanicswould likely in crease by more than the national average with inflation still well above the committees longer run goal of percent participants agreed that inflation was unacceptably high participants concurred that the inflation data received for october and november showed welcome reductions in the monthly pace of price increases but they stressed that it would take sub stantially more evidence of progress to be confident that inflation was on a sustained downward path partici pants noted that core goods prices declined in the octo ber and november cpi data consistent with easing sup ply bottlenecks some participants also noted that by some measures firms markups were still elevated and that a continued subdued expansion in aggregate de mand would likely be needed to reduce remaining up ward pressure on inflation regarding housing services inflation many participants observed that measures of rent based on new leases were indicating a deceleration which would be reflected in the measures of shelter in flation with some lag participants noted that in the lat est inflation data the pace of increase for prices of core services excluding shelterwhich represents the largest component of core pce price inflationwas high they also remarked that this component of inflation has tended to be closely linked to nominal wage growth and therefore would likely remain persistently elevated if the labor market remained very tight consequently while there were few signs of adverse wageprice dynamics at present they assessed that bringing down this compo nent of inflation to mandateconsistent levels would re quire some softening in the growth of labor demand to bring the labor market back into better balance participants observed that measures from surveys of households and businesses as well as from financial mar kets generally indicated that longerterm inflation expec tations remained well anchored while shortterm infla tion expectations had come down however partici pants stressed that the committees ongoing monetary policy tightening to achieve a stance that will be suffi ciently restrictive to return inflation to percent is es sential for ensuring that longerterm expectations re main well anchored several participants commented that the longer inflation remained well above the per cent goal the greater the risk that longerterm inflation expectations could become unanchored such a devel opment if it materialized would make it much more costly to bring inflation down to achieve the commit tees statutory objectives of maximum employment and price stability participants noted that since the november meeting fi nancial conditions had eased with the marketimplied path for the federal funds rate beyond and longer page federal open market committee term yields coming down noticeably a few participants remarked that the current configuration of nominal yields with longerterm yields lower than shorterterm yields had historically preceded recessions and hence bore watching however a couple of them also noted that the current inversion of the yield curve could reflect in part that investors expect the nominal policy rate to decline because of a fall in inflation over time participants generally noted that the uncertainty associ ated with their economic outlooks was high and that the risks to the inflation outlook remained tilted to the up side participants cited the possibility that price pres sures could prove to be more persistent than anticipated due to for example the labor market staying tight for longer than anticipated participants saw a number of uncertainties surrounding the outlook for inflation stem ming from factors abroad such as chinas relaxation of its zerocovid policies russias continuing war against ukraine and effects of synchronous policy firm ing by major central banks a number of participants judged that the risks to the outlook for economic activity were weighted to the downside they noted that sources of such risks included the potential for more persistent inflation inducing more restrictive policy responses the prospect of unexpected negative shocks tipping the economy into a recession in an environment of subdued growth and the possibility of households and busi nesses concerns about the outlook restraining their spending sufficiently to reduce aggregate output in their consideration of appropriate monetary policy ac tions at this meeting participants concurred that the committee had made significant progress over the past year in moving toward a sufficiently restrictive stance of monetary policy even so participants agreed that infla tion remained well above the committees longerrun goal of percent while the labor market remained very tight contributing to upward pressures on wages and prices against this backdrop all participants agreed that it was appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate basis points at this meeting and to continue the process of reducing the federal reserves securities holdings as described in the plans for reducing the size of the federal reserves balance sheet that the commit tee issued in may participants observed that a slowing in the pace of rate increases at this meeting would better allow the committee to assess the economys progress toward the committees goals of maximum employment and price stability as monetary policy approached a stance that was sufficiently restrictive to achieve these goals in discussing the policy outlook participants continued to anticipate that ongoing increases in the target range for the federal funds rate would be appropriate to achieve the committees objectives in determining the pace of future increases in the target range participants judged that it would be appropriate to take into account the cumulative tightening of monetary policy the lags with which monetary policy affects economic activity and inflation and economic and financial developments with inflation staying persistently above the commit tees percent goal and the labor market remaining very tight all participants had raised their assessment of the appropriate path of the federal funds rate relative to their assessment at the time of the september meeting no participants anticipated that it would be appropriate to begin reducing the federal funds rate target in par ticipants generally observed that a restrictive policy stance would need to be maintained until the incoming data provided confidence that inflation was on a sus tained downward path to percent which was likely to take some time in view of the persistent and unaccept ably high level of inflation several participants com mented that historical experience cautioned against prematurely loosening monetary policy in light of the heightened uncertainty regarding the out looks for both inflation and real economic activity most participants emphasized the need to retain flexibility and optionality when moving policy to a more restrictive stance participants generally noted that the commit tees future decisions regarding policy would continue to be informed by the incoming data and their implications for the outlook for economic activity and inflation and that the committee would continue to make decisions meeting by meeting participants reaffirmed their strong commitment to re turning inflation to the committees percent objective a number of participants emphasized that it would be important to clearly communicate that a slowing in the pace of rate increases was not an indication of any weak ening of the committees resolve to achieve its price stability goal or a judgment that inflation was already on a persistent downward path participants noted that be cause monetary policy worked importantly through fi nancial markets an unwarranted easing in financial con ditions especially if driven by a misperception by the public of the committees reaction function would complicate the committees effort to restore price sta bility several participants commented that the medians of participants assessments for the appropriate path of the federal funds rate in the summary of economic pro jections which tracked notably above marketbased minutes of the meeting of december page measures of policy rate expectations underscored the committees strong commitment to returning inflation to its percent goal participants discussed a number of riskmanagement considerations related to the conduct of monetary pol icy many participants highlighted that the committee needed to continue to balance two risks one risk was that an insufficiently restrictive monetary policy could cause inflation to remain above the committees target for longer than anticipated leading to unanchored infla tion expectations and eroding the purchasing power of households especially for those already facing difficulty making ends meet the other risk was that the lagged cumulative effect of policy tightening could end up be ing more restrictive than is necessary to bring down in flation to percent and lead to an unnecessary reduction in economic activity potentially placing the largest bur dens on the most vulnerable groups of the population participants generally indicated that upside risks to the inflation outlook remained a key factor shaping the out look for policy a couple of participants noted that risks to the inflation outlook were becoming more balanced participants generally observed that maintaining a re strictive policy stance for a sustained period until infla tion is clearly on a path toward percent is appropriate from a riskmanagement perspective committee policy action in their discussion of monetary policy for this meeting members agreed that recent indicators pointed to mod est growth in spending and production members also concurred that job gains had been robust in recent months and the

determining the pace of future increases in the target range they would take into account the cumulative tightening of monetary policy the lags with which monetary policy affects eco nomic activity and inflation and economic and financial developments in addition members agreed that they would continue reducing the federal reserves holdings of treasury securities and agency debt and agency mort gagebacked securities as described in the plans for re ducing the size of the federal reserves balance sheet that were issued in may all members affirmed that the committee is strongly committed to returning inflation to its percent objective members agreed that in assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy they would continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook they would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the committees goals mem bers agreed that their assessments will take into account a wide range of information including readings on pub lic health labor market conditions inflation pressures and inflation expectations and financial and interna

with the federal reserve bank of dallas minutes of the meeting of january february page as part of the annual review of the committees govern ance documents for open market operations and foreign currency transactions the committee unanimously ap proved a new governance document titled fomc au thorizations and continuing directives for open market operations the new document includes authori zations previously in the committees authorization for foreign currency operations and authorization for domestic open market operations a new contin uing directive for domestic open market operations which combines direction to the desk in the standing repurchase agreement facility and fima repurchase agreement facility resolutions with direction to the desk to continue to carry out other ongoing activities the foreign currency directive and two other existing documents related to contingency arrange ments the new unified document improves clarity and transparency in the governance of desk activities but does not make substantive changes to governance the domestic policy directive released after each fomc meeting will have modest conforming changes going forward ahead of the vote on policies relating to information se curity external communications and investment and trading the chair commented on the critical importance of maintaining the publics trust and confidence in the federal reserve as an institution and indicated that these policies were very important in that regard all partici pants indicated support for and agreed to abide by the requirements of the program for security of fomc in formation program the fomc policy on external communications of committee participants the fomc policy on external communications of federal reserve system staff and the investment and trading policy for fomc officials the committee voted unanimously to reaffirm all four policies without revision as part of the committees annual organizational review process all participants indicated support for the state ment on longerrun goals and monetary policy strat egy and the committee voted unanimously to reaffirm it without revision developments in financial markets and open market operations the manager pro tem turned first to a review of us financial market developments market participants generally expected us economic growth to moderate this year although there was a wide dispersion in views about the extent of a potential slowdown market par ticipants interpreted incoming data as pointing to mod erating inflation risks against this backdrop market participants judged that the fomc would likely slow the pace of rate increases further at the current meeting and respondents to the desks survey of primary dealers and survey of market participants widely expected the committee to implement a percentage point increase in the target range for the federal funds rate survey re spondents assessed that uncertainty around the likely peak level of the policy rate narrowed relative to the comparable results from the december surveys and on average placed significant probability on a target federal funds rate range close to percent a significant share of survey respondents anticipated that the committee would hold the policy rate stable for much of moderating inflation in the united states and improving global growth prospects lifted market sentiment while most desk survey respondents expected subdued growth or a mild recession in market participants continued to see notable uncertainties ahead including prospects for a deeper downturn or the potential for more persistent inflation regarding the international outlook signs of a faster re opening in china and a less severe downturn in europe eased concerns about global growth contributing to a depreciation in the exchange value of the dollar and sup porting optimism about emerging market economies narrowing interest rate differentials between the united states and other advanced foreign economies also con tributed to dollar depreciation as some foreign central bank communications suggested a need for further mon etary policy tightening to address inflation pressures in addition the bank of japan unexpectedly widened its yield curve control band at its december meeting to ad dress market functioning issues in the market for japa nese government bonds over the period some other central banks communicated that they were at or near a point where it would be appropriate to pause policy rate increases and assess the effects of cumulative policy tightening the manager pro tem turned next to a discussion of money markets and federal reserve operations money market rates were stable over the period with the year end passing smoothly as expected balances in the overnight reverse repurchase agreement on rrp fa cility increased at yearend but quickly retraced market participants generally expected usage of the on rrp fa cility to continue a downward trend in moderating the decline in reserve balances as the federal reserves holdings of securities continue to run off should tran sitory pressures occur in money markets over the course of the year the manager pro tem noted that the standing page federal open market committee repurchase agreement repo facility and discount win dow would be available to help support effective mone tary policy implementation the manager noted that over coming months develop ments affecting the treasury general account tga and treasury financing could influence money market conditions an increase in tga balances associated with april individual tax receipts could result in a tem porary decline in reserve balances in subsequent months uncertainties associated with the debt limit could also be important in particular the treasury could increase bill issuance to rebuild tga balances once the debt limit is lifted reducing reserves and po tentially lifting money market rates the manager pro tem noted that in recent months investors in the on rrp facility had responded to small increases in money market rates by shifting balances into private in vestments and that reductions in on rrp volumes may help smooth adjustments in money markets by unanimous vote the committee ratified the desks domestic transactions over the intermeeting period there were no intervention operations in foreign currencies for the systems account during the intermeeting period staff review of the economic situation the information available at the time of the january february meeting indicated that labor market condi tions remained tight in december with the unemploy ment rate at a historical low consumer price inflation as measured by the month percent change in the price index for personal

of consumer expectations remained within the range of their values reported in recent months while nearterm measures of inflation expectations from these surveys moved down along with actual inflation although real gdp expanded at an annual rate of percent in the fourth quarter real private domestic final purchases pdfpwhich includes pce residen tial investment and business fixed investmentin creased at a subdued annual rate of percent real gdp growth was bolstered especially by a large gain in inventory investment and a notable contribution from net exports as imports fell more than exports both in ventories and net exports are volatile categories in aggre gate spending regarding production us manufactur ing output declined sizably in both november and de cember foreign economic growth slowed in the fourth quarter weighed down by the covidrelated slowdown in china and repercussions of russias war against ukraine weaker global demand and a rebalancing from goods to services also resulted in a pronounced slowdown in manufacturing which weighed on activity in emerging asia in china the pivot away from its zerocovid policy appears to have resulted in a rapid surge in virus cases late in the year but also in a rebound in activity as restrictions were rapidly removed in europe the slow down in economic growth was tempered by mild winter weather which also prompted further declines in energy minutes of the meeting of january february page prices a decline in retail energy as well as food prices contributed to an easing in headline consumer price in flation in many

available for businesses and households with strong credit quality but remained tight for lowerrated borrowers lending standards tightened further for bankdependent borrowers issuance of cor porate bonds was subdued in december before picking up somewhat in january new launches of leveraged loans were notably subdued in december and january likely reflecting soft investor demand and higher refer

mortgagebacked securities remained slow in november and december amid high base interest rates and spreads some tightening in lending conditions was also evident for small businesses with the share of small firms reporting that it was more difficult to obtain credit compared with three months earlier continuing to trend up through december credit was broadly available in the residential mortgage

downgrades outpaced upgrades in december al though the level of downgrades remained moderate leveraged loans experienced notable net rating down grades in december but the pace moderated in january default rates on corporate bonds and leveraged loans remained low measures of expected default probabili ties for corporate bonds and leveraged loans remained elevated relative to their historical

in their portfolio over delinquencies on small business loans continued to edge up in november but remained low relative to historical levels the credit quality of households also remained strong on

delinquency rates for credit cards and auto loans continued to rise during the third quarter while delinquency rates on credit cards were still relatively low those on auto loans rose above prepandemic levels in the january sloos banks reported expecting a further deterioration in the quality of household loans in especially for con sumer loans the staff provided an update on its assessment of the stability of the financial system and on balance charac terized the financial vulnerabilities of the us financial system as moderate the staff judged that asset valua tion pressures remained notable in particular the staff noted that measures of valuations in both residential and commercial property markets remained high and that the potential for large declines in property prices re mained greater than usual in addition the forward pricetoearnings ratio for sp firms remained above its median value despite the decline in equity prices over the past year the staff assessed that valua tion pressures had eased for corporate bonds and lever aged loans as spreads in both markets had increased from recent lows the staff assessed that vulnerabilities associated with household and business leverage remained moderate noting that although measures of business leverage were at or near a historically high level the ability of firms to service their debt has kept pace with rising debt loads and interest rates household borrowing rose for bor rowers with prime credit scores but declined for house holds with lower credit scores vulnerabilities associated with financial leverage also remained moderate in par ticular riskbased capital ratios for banks increased slightly a staff measure of leverage at life insurance com panies remained relatively flat in recent quarters and lev erage among private credit funds has remained steady for several years while measures of hedge fund leverage have decreased since the pandemic shock the staff noted that leverage among the largest funds was on track to return to levels vulnerabilities associated with funding risks were char acterized as moderate the rising rate environment has prompted inflows into prime retail mmfs while aum at prime institutional funds which have proved more sensitive to turmoil in the past have grown much less assets in openend mutual funds that invest in less liquid minutes of the meeting of january february page instruments like bank loans or highyield corporate bonds have declined notably over the past year in re sponse to vulnerabilities at mmfs and openend mutual funds the securities and exchange commission has proposed rules to make these funds more resilient staff economic outlook the forecast for the us economy prepared by the staff for this fomc meeting had a somewhat higher path for the level of real gdp and a modestly lower path for the unemployment rate than in the december projection re flecting both the recent data and a small additional boost to output from a lower projected path for the dollar al though recent data indicated that real gdp growth in the fourth quarter of was stronger than expected real pdfp growth was weaker than previously forecast and the large unexpected boost to gdp growth from inventory investment was not projected to persist in part reflecting the lagged effects of previous monetary policy tightening the staff still projected real gdp growth to slow markedly this year and the labor market to soften the staff forecast continued to include a pickup in real gdp growth starting next year although projected output growth in and remains be low the staffs estimate of potential output growth the level of real output was expected to move down to the staffs estimate of potential near the end of like wise the unemployment rate was projected to gradually move up to the staffs estimate of its natural rate at the end of on a fourquarter change basis total pce price inflation was forecast to be percent in and core inflation was expected to be percent both lower than in the december projection with the effects of supplyde mand imbalances in goods markets expected to further unwind and labor and product markets projected to be come less tight the staff continued to forecast that infla tion would decline further over and on a fourquarter change basis core goods inflation was pro jected to move down further this year and then remain subdued housing services inflation was expected to peak later this year and then move down and core nonhous ing services inflation was forecast to slow as nominal wage growth eased with steep declines in consumer energy prices and a substantial moderation in food price inflation expected for this year total inflation was pro jected to step down markedly this year and then to track core inflation over the following two years in both total and core pce price inflation were expected to be near percent the sluggish growth in real private domestic spending expected this year and the persistently tight financial conditions were seen as tilting the risks to the downside around the baseline projection for real economic activ ity and the staff still viewed the possibility of a recession sometime this year as a plausible alternative to the base line moreover with core pce price inflation having slowed in recent months along with the cumulative up ward revisions to the core inflation projection over the past year and the expected softening in economic growth the staff now viewed the risks around the base line forecast for inflation this year as balanced for be yond this year the staff continued to view the risks around the inflation projection as skewed to the upside reflecting concerns about the potential persistence of in flation participants views on current conditions and the economic outlook in their discussion of current economic conditions par ticipants noted that recent indicators pointed to modest growth in spending and production nonetheless job gains had been robust in recent months and the unem ployment rate remained low inflation had eased some what but remained elevated participants recognized that russias war against ukraine was causing tremen dous human and economic hardship and was contrib uting to elevated global uncertainty against this back ground participants continued to be highly attentive to inflation risks participants agreed that cumulative policy firming to date had reduced demand in the most interestratesen sitive sectors of the economy particularly housing par ticipants observed that growth in economic activity in had been below its longerrun trend and expected that real gdp growth would slow further in while real gdp growth had rebounded in the second half of several participants noted that growth in pdfp had nearly stalled in the fourth quarter with inflation remaining unacceptably high participants expected that a period of belowtrend growth in real gdp would be needed to bring aggregate demand into better balance with aggregate supply and thereby reduce inflationary pressures some participants judged that recent eco nomic data signaled a somewhat higher chance of con tinued subdued economic growth with inflation falling over time to the committees longerrun goal of per cent although some participants noted that the proba bility of the economy entering a recession in re mained elevated page federal open market committee in their discussion of the household sector participants observed that real consumer spending had declined in november and decemberin part reflecting the tight ening in financial conditions over the past yearand an ticipated that consumption would likely grow at a sub dued rate in participants noted that excess savings accumulated during the pandemic had continued to sup port consumption although several participants re marked that the importance of this factor would likely wane over time as excess savings continued to be drawn down or eroded by inflation a couple of participants observed that some consumers were shifting their spending to less expensive alternatives a few partici pants noted the effects of higher interest costs in re straining consumption or inhibiting the ability of some households to repay their loans while a couple of par ticipants noted that inflation was eroding households purchasing power however a couple of participants noted that some states could return part of their sizable budget surpluses to households through tax cuts or re bates which would provide support to consumption participants agreed that activity in the housing market had continued to weaken largely reflecting the increase in mortgage rates over the past year regarding the business sector participants observed that growth in business fixed investment spending had been subdued in the fourth quarter and was being restrained by past interest rate increases a number of participants commented that supply bottlenecks continued to ease although supply chain issues remained a challenge in some sectors several participants remarked that the re cent strong growth in inventory investment will likely slow a couple of those participants noted that busi nesses appeared more confident that significant supply bottlenecks would not reemerge and might therefore choose to hold smaller inventories some participants commented that the easing of covidrelated lockdown restrictions in china or strongerthanexpected growth in economic activity in the euro area could provide sup port to final demand in the united states participants agreed that the labor market remained very tight and assessed that labor demand substantially ex ceeded the supply of available workers participants noted that the unemployment rate had returned to a his torically low level in december job vacancies remained high and wage growth remained elevated several par ticipants noted that recent reductions in the workforces of some large technology businesses followed much larger increases over the previous few years and judged that these reductions did not appear to reflect wide spread weakness in the demand for labor a few partic ipants remarked that some business contacts appeared keen to retain workers even in the face of slowing de mand for output because of their recent experiences of labor shortages and hiring challenges participants agreed that labor supply remained constrained by struc tural factors such as the effects from the pandemic in cluding those on early retirements and the reduced avail ability and increased cost of childcare nevertheless participants noted tentative signs that imbalances be tween demand and supply in the labor market were im proving with job vacancies and payroll gains declining somewhat from high levels the average number of hours worked falling and growth in wages and employ ment costs slowing some participants commented on the recent reduction in temporary employment which previously had often preceded more widespread reduc tions in labor demand under appropriate monetary policy participants expected labor market demand and supply to come into better balance over time easing up ward pressure on nominal wages and prices a number of participants commented on the importance of recog nizing that to the extent national unemployment in creases historical evidence indicates that even larger in creases in the unemployment rate for some demographic groupsparticularly african americans and hispan icswould be likely to occur with inflation still well above the committees longer run goal of percent participants agreed that inflation was unacceptably high a number of participants com mented that the costs of elevated inflation are particu larly high for lowerincome households participants noted that inflation data received over the past three months showed a welcome reduction in the monthly pace of price increases but stressed that substantially more evidence of progress across a broader range of prices would be required to be confident that inflation was on a sustained downward path participants noted that core goods prices had declined notably over the pre vious few months as supply bottlenecks had eased but anticipated that price declines for this component would dissipate as the downward pressure on goods prices from resolving supply bottlenecks fades participants judged that housing services inflation would likely begin to fall later this year reflecting continued smaller in creases or potentially declines in rents on new leases participants agreed that they had observed less evidence of a slowdown in the rate of increase of prices for core services excluding housing a category that accounts for more than half of the core pce price index participants judged that as long as the labor market remained very minutes of the meeting of january february page tight wage growth in excess of percent inflation and trend productivity growth would likely continue to put upward pressure on some prices in this component a couple of participants observed that changes in wages tend to lag changes in prices which can complicate the assessment of inflation pressures a couple of partici pants remarked that the poor performance of labor productivity growth last year was restraining aggregate supply which was contributing to imbalances between aggregate demand and aggregate supply and therefore to upward pressure on inflation several participants noted the possibility that as consumers become more price sensitive businesses might accept lower profit margins in an effort to maintain market share which could re duce inflation temporarily participants observed that indicators of shortterm inflation expectations from sur veys of households and businesses as well as from finan cial markets had come down and that longerterm infla tion expectations remained well anchored a number of participants noted the importance of longerterm infla tion expectations remaining anchored and remarked that the longer inflation remained elevated the greater the risk of inflation expectations becoming unanchored in that adverse scenario it would be more costly to bring inflation down to achieve the committees statutory ob jectives of maximum employment and price stability participants observed that financial conditions remained much tighter than in early however several par ticipants observed that some measures of financial con ditions had eased over the past few months a few par ticipants noted that increased confidence among market participants that inflation would fall quickly appeared to contribute to declines in market expectations of the fed eral funds rate path beyond the near term participants noted that it was important that overall financial condi tions be consistent with the degree of policy restraint that the committee is putting into place in order to bring inflation back to the percent goal participants observed that the uncertainty associated with their outlooks for economic activity the labor mar ket and inflation was high regarding upside risks to inflation participants cited a variety of factors including the possibility that price pressures could prove to be more persistent than anticipated due to for example the labor market staying tight for longer than anticipated participants also saw a number of upside risks surround ing the outlook for inflation stemming from factors abroad such as chinas relaxation of its zerocovid policies and russias continuing war against ukraine however a few participants remarked that the risks to their inflation outlook had become more balanced par ticipants agreed that the risks to the outlook for eco nomic activity were weighted to the downside partici pants noted that sources of such risks included the pro spect of unexpected negative shocks tipping the econ omy into a recession in an environment of subdued growth the effects of synchronous policy firming by ma jor central banks and disruptions in the financial system and broader economy associated with concerns that the statutory debt limit might not be raised in a timely man ner in their discussion of issues related to financial stability several participants discussed vulnerabilities in the finan cial system associated with higher interest rates includ ing the elevated valuations for some categories of assets particularly in the cre sector the susceptibility of some nonbank financial institutions to runs and the effect of large unrealized losses on some banks securities port folios a few participants commented that international stresses had the potential to transmit to the us financial system a number of participants noted the importance of orderly functioning of the market for us treasury securities and stressed the importance of the appropriate authorities continuing to address issues related to the re silience of the market although several participants noted that the federal reserves standing liquidity facil ities could be helpful in addressing significant pressures in funding markets should they arise several partici pants also noted the challenges of addressing potential disruptions in us core market functioning a few par ticipants remarked that recent failures of companies in volved in crypto finance have had a limited effect on the broader financial system these participants indicated that this limited effect reflected the minimal extent of the crypto markets connections to the banking system thus far consistent with the risks associated with many of these activities several participants discussed the value of the federal reserve taking additional steps to understand the potential risks associated with climate change or to assess the materiality of such risks in the context of carrying out its responsibilities to evaluate risks in the banking system and broader financial system a number of participants stressed that a drawnout pe riod of negotiations to raise the federal debt limit could pose significant risks to the financial system and the broader economy in their consideration of appropriate monetary policy ac tions at this meeting participants concurred that the committee had made significant progress over the past year in moving toward a sufficiently restrictive stance of monetary policy even so participants agreed that page federal open market committee while there were recent signs that the cumulative effect of the committees tightening of the stance of monetary policy had begun to moderate inflationary pressures in flation remained well above the committees longerrun goal of percent and the labor market remained very tight contributing to continuing upward pressures on wages and prices against this backdrop and in consid eration of the lags with which monetary policy affects economic activity and inflation almost all participants agreed that it was appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate basis points at this meeting many of these participants observed that a further slow ing in the pace of rate increases would better allow them to assess the economys progress toward the commit tees goals of maximum employment and price stability as they determine the extent of future policy tightening that will be required to attain a stance that is sufficiently restrictive to achieve these goals a few participants stated that they favored raising the target range for the federal funds rate basis points at this meeting or that they could have supported raising the target by that amount the participants favoring a basis point in crease noted that a larger increase would more quickly bring the target range close to the levels they believed would achieve a sufficiently restrictive stance taking into account their views of the risks to achieving price stabil ity in a timely way all participants agreed that it was appropriate to continue the process of reducing the fed eral reserves securities holdings as described in its pre viously announced plans for reducing the size of the federal reserves balance sheet in discussing the policy outlook with inflation still well above the committees percent goal and the labor market remaining very tight all participants continued to anticipate that ongoing increases in the target range for the federal funds rate would be appropriate to achieve the committees objectives participants affirmed their strong commitment to returning inflation to the com mittees percent objective in determining the extent of future increases in the target range participants judged that it would be appropriate to take into account the cumulative tightening of monetary policy the lags with which monetary policy affects economic activity and inflation and economic and financial developments participants observed that a restrictive policy stance would need to be maintained until the incoming data provided confidence that inflation was on a sustained downward path to percent which was likely to take some time participants discussed the heightened uncertainty re garding the economic outlook and a number of factors that could affect inflation and real economic activity participants generally noted that the committees future decisions regarding policy would continue to be in formed by the incoming data and their implications for the outlook for economic activity and inflation a num ber of participants observed that financial conditions had eased in recent months which some noted could necessitate a tighter stance of monetary policy participants also discussed a number of riskmanage ment considerations related to the conduct of monetary policy almost all participants observed that slowing the pace of rate increases at the current juncture would allow for appropriate risk management as the committee as sessed the extent of further tightening needed to meet the committees goals several of those participants ob served that risks to the economic outlook were becom ing more balanced with inflation still well above the committees longerrun goal participants generally noted that upside risks to the inflation outlook remained a key factor shaping the policy outlook and that main taining a restrictive policy stance until inflation is clearly on a path toward percent is appropriate from a risk management perspective a number of participants ob served that a policy stance that proved to be insuffi ciently restrictive could halt recent progress in moderat ing inflationary pressures leading inflation to remain above the committees percent objective for a longer period and pose a risk of inflation expectations becom ing unanchored participants noted that the runoff of the balance sheet had been proceeding smoothly a few participants ob served that money markets could experience some tem porary pressures as reserves declined if use of the fed eral reserves on rrp facility continued to remain high they noted however that such pressures should they occur would likely cause an upward repricing of private moneymarket rates that could encourage market participants to reduce their use of the facility committee policy actions in their discussion of monetary policy for this meeting members agreed that recent indicators pointed to mod est growth in spending and production members also concurred that job gains had been robust in recent months and the unemployment rate had remained low members agreed that inflation had eased somewhat but remained elevated members concurred that russias war against ukraine was causing tremendous human and economic hardship and was contributing to

achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of per cent over the longer run in support of these goals members agreed to raise the target range for the federal funds rate to to percent members anticipated that ongoing increases in the target range would be ap propriate in order to attain a stance of monetary policy that is sufficiently restrictive to return inflation to per cent over time members concurred that in determining the extent of future increases in the target range they would take into account the cumulative tightening of monetary policy the lags with which monetary policy af fects economic activity and inflation and economic and financial developments in addition members agreed that they would continue reducing the federal reserves holdings of treasury securities and agency debt and agency mortgagebacked securities as described in its previously announced plans the committee remained strongly committed to returning inflation to its percent objective members agreed that in assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy they would continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook they would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the committees goals mem bers agreed that their assessments will take into account a wide range of information

chair for supervision to provide an update on recent developments in the banking sector the vice chair for supervision described the developments in cluding those at silicon valley bank signature bank and page federal open market committee credit suisse he also described actions taken by the federal reserve and other regulatory agencies in re sponse he noted that the us banking system is sound and resilient he also noted that he will be leading a re view of the supervision and regulation of silicon valley bank and that the federal reserve system will apply what is learned from the review to strengthen its super visory and regulatory practices as appropriate developments in financial markets and open market operations the manager turned first to a review of us financial market developments over the intermeeting period early in the period firmerthanexpected data and policy communications pushed interest rates higher and equity prices lower developments in the banking sector later in the period were met with sharp reductions in treasury yields particularly at shorter tenors treasury market li quidity was poor and implied volatility was high but the market remained functional amid substantial trading ac tivity higher treasury market volatility contributed to wider spreads for household and business borrowing financial conditions tightened considerably over the in termeeting period as a whole market contacts observed that the recent developments in the banking system will likely result in a pullback in bank lending which would not be reflected in most common financial conditions indexes following the bankingsector developments equity prices for large us banks underperformed the broad market equity prices for us regional banks gen erally underperformed by relatively more regarding the outlook for inflation in the united states marketbased measures of inflation compensation over shorter horizons rose over the period although com pensation retraced a good portion of its increase later in the period as markets reacted to the developments in the banking sector forward inflation compensation measures continued to indicate that longerterm infla tion expectations remained well anchored measures of inflation expectations from the open market desks survey of primary dealers and survey of market partic ipants moved higher at shorter horizons and were little changed at longer horizons regarding the outlook for monetary policy market based measures of policy expectations suggested that the federal funds rate would reach a peak in may and that the target range would then move lower however the medians of respondents modal expectations of the federal funds rate from the desk surveys did not show any declines in the target range through the end of risk and liquidity premiums embedded in market prices may have driven a good part of the difference between survey and market measures the median respondent expected the summary of economic projections sep projections for the federal funds rate at the end of and to shift basis points higher however in formation gathered after the desk surveys closed sug gests that those expectations had declined some to a level comparable with the december sep survey re sponses suggested only modest changes in expectations for balance sheet policy the manager turned next to a discussion of operations and money markets federal funds volumes fell sharply for a few days late in the period as federal home loan banks fhlbs sought to maintain liquidity in order to meet increased demand for advances by member banks money market rates remained broadly stable and se cured and unsecured money market rates including the effective fed funds rate traded well within the target range use of us dollar liquidity swap lines with for eign central banks had been minimal indicating that market participants did not face significant difficulties in obtaining dollar funding from private sources borrowing from the new bank term funding program had been small relative to discount window borrowing which had increased to record levels use of the over night reverse repurchase agreement on rrp facility fell especially for money market mutual funds mmfs as the supply of shortterm securities at attractive rates increased by unanimous vote the committee ratified the desks domestic transactions over the intermeeting period there were no intervention operations in foreign curren cies for the systems account during the intermeeting pe riod staff review of the economic situation the information

surveys moved down real gdp growth seemed to be expanding at a modest pace in the first quarter gains in consumer spending had picked up in recent months but growth in business fixed investment was

inflation compensation measures increas ing and broad stock market price indexes declining fi nancing conditions for businesses households and mu nicipalities had tightened during this period and were moderately restrictive overall as borrowing costs in creased notably with the expected path of policy rates and treasury yields and as some lenders appeared to tighten nonprice borrowing terms

quality continued to deteriorate in some markets pricing in financial markets changed notably in the latter part of the intermeeting period amid developments in the banking sector treasury yields and policy rate ex pectations moved down significantly while broad stock price indexes rose somewhat the marketimplied pol icy rate path shifted down sizably with the federal funds rate expected to peak

points lower than before the closures of silicon valley bank and signature bank but somewhat higher than at the time of the february fomc meeting treasury yields declined especially at shorter maturities reflecting downward revisions in pol icy rate expectations and the effects of flight to safety inflation compensation declined especially at short ma turities likely reflecting in part a relatively larger decline in risk premiums on nominal treasury securities relative to treasury inflationprotected securities due to strong safehaven demands late in the intermeeting period us bank stock prices declined notably regional banks with unusually large reliance on uninsured deposits and holdings of securities with significant unrealized marktomarket losses expe rienced larger declines

reflecting increased uncertainty about the interest rate outlook some of the pricing moves in asset markets may have been amplified by impaired liquidity condi tions despite deteriorating liquidity

economic activity and stubbornly high core inflation across advanced economies earlier in the period to stresses in the global banking sector more recently ear lier in the period yields and marketbased measures of inflation expectations in the afes increased notably driven by spillovers from us treasury yields as well as upside surprises in economic and inflation data for afes later in

increased demand for advances by member banks market volume subsequently rebounded partially activity in the repur chase agreement market was robust and trading volume remained within recent ranges on

banking sector were limited after the two bank clo sures issuance of municipal bond and leveraged loans was sluggish and gross issuance of corporate bonds fell to near zero mortgage loans to households remained available the credit quality of businesses and households was largely stable over the intermeeting period however measures of credit performance showed some signs of weakening leveraged loan credit quality deteriorated somewhat after the closures of silicon valley bank and signature bank credit quality for residential mortgages remained unchanged staff economic outlook for some time the forecast for the us economy pre pared by the staff had featured subdued real gdp growth for this year and some softening in the labor market given their assessment of the potential eco nomic effects of the recent bankingsector develop ments the staffs projection at the time of the march meeting included a mild recession starting later this year with a recovery over the subsequent two years real gdp growth in was projected to remain below the staffs estimate of potential output growth and then gdp growth in was expected to be above that of potential resource utilization in both product and labor markets was forecast to be much less tight than in the january projection the level of real output was pro jected to move below the staffs estimate of potential output in early more than a year sooner than in the previous projection likewise the unemployment rate was projected to rise above the staffs estimate of its nat ural rate early next year on a fourquarter change basis total pce price inflation was forecast to be percent this year with core infla tion at percent core goods inflation was projected to move down further this year and then remain sub dued housing services inflation was expected to peak later this year and then move down while core nonhous ing services inflation was forecast to slow gradually as nominal wage growth eased further reflecting the ef fects of less projected tightness in product and labor markets core inflation was forecast to slow sharply next year with steep declines in consumer energy prices and a substantial moderation in food price inflation expected for this year total inflation was projected to step down markedly this year and then to track core inflation over the following two years in and both total and core pce price inflation were expected to be near percent the staff judged that the uncertainty around the baseline projection was much greater than at the time of the pre vious forecast in particular the staff viewed the risks around the baseline projection as determined im portantly by banking conditions and the implications for financial conditions if the effects of the recent devel opments in the banking sector on macroeconomic con ditions were to abate quickly then the risks around the baseline would be tilted to the upside for both economic activity and inflation if banking and financial condi tions and their effects on macroeconomic conditions were to deteriorate more than assumed in the baseline then the risks around the baseline would be skewed to the downside for both economic activity and inflation particularly because historical recessions related to finan cial market problems tend to be more severe and persis tent than average recessions participants views on current conditions and the economic outlook in conjunction with this fomc meeting participants submitted their projections of the most likely outcomes for real gdp growth the unemployment rate and infla tion for each year from through and over the longer run the projections were based on their individ ual assessments of appropriate monetary policy includ ing the path of the federal funds rate the longerrun projections represented each participants assessment of the rate to which each variable would be expected to converge over time under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy an sep was released to the public following the conclu sion of the meeting in their discussion of current economic conditions par ticipants noted that recent indicators pointed to modest growth in spending and production at the same time though participants noted that job gains had picked up in recent months and were running at a robust pace the unemployment rate had remained low inflation re mained elevated participants agreed that the us bank ing system remained sound and resilient they com mented that recent developments in the banking sector were likely to result in tighter credit conditions for households and businesses and to weigh on economic activity hiring and inflation participants agreed that the extent of these effects was uncertain against this page federal open market committee background participants continued to be highly atten tive to inflation risks in assessing the economic outlook participants noted that since they met in february data on inflation em ployment and economic activity generally came in stronger than expected they also noted however that the developments in the banking sector that had oc curred late in the intermeeting period affected their views of the economic and policy outlook and the un certainty surrounding that outlook based on incoming economic data participants assessments of the effects of cumulative policy firming and their initial views on the likely economic effect of the recent bankingsector developments participants generally expected real gdp to grow this year at a pace well below its longrun trend rate with inflation remaining unacceptably high partic ipants expected that a period of belowtrend growth in real gdp would be needed to bring aggregate demand into better balance with aggregate supply and thereby re duce inflationary pressures many participants remarked that the incoming data before the onset of the banking sector stresses had led them to see the appropriate path for the federal funds rate as somewhat higher than their assessment at the time of the december meeting after incorporating the bankingsector developments partici pants indicated that their policy rate projections were now about unchanged from december participants agreed that the actions taken so far by the federal reserve in coordination with other government agencies as well as actions taken by foreign authorities to address banking and financial stresses outside the us had helped calm conditions in the banking sector even with the actions participants recognized that there was significant uncertainty as to how those conditions would evolve participants assessed that the develop ments so far would likely lead to some weakening of credit conditions as some banks were likely to tighten lending standards amid rising funding costs and in creased concerns about liquidity participants noted that it was too early to assess with confidence the magnitude of the effect of a credit tightening on economic activity and inflation and that it was important to continue to closely monitor developments and update assessments of the actual and expected effects of credit tightening several participants noted that regional and community banks a small number of which had come under signif icant stress were important in small business and mid dlemarket lending and were providing critical and unique financial services to many communities and in dustries in their discussion of the household sector participants noted that incoming data on real consumer expenditures showed a pickup in spending in january and february they attributed the pickup to strong job gains rising real disposable income and households continuing to run down excess savings accumulated during the pandemic they also noted that an atypically warm start to this year along with challenges in seasonally adjusting data likely contributed to the pickup in the reported data a few participants observed that credit card delinquencies par ticularly for lowerincome households had risen in the face of elevated inflation and higher nominal interest rates participants noted that recent developments in the banking sector and the associated rise in uncertainty would likely weigh on consumer sentiment and that in creased caution on the part of consumers could restrain spending a couple of participants observed that high frequency measures of consumer sentiment had not yet shown a significant change following the recent devel opments in the banking sector although they also acknowledged that the situation was fluid regarding the business sector participants observed that growth in business fixed investment was being re strained by tighter financial conditions that reflected cu mulative policy firming to date participants expected the likely tightening of credit conditions due to the re cent developments in the banking sector to further weigh on investment spending in addition the bank ingsector developments could damp business confi dence and increase firms caution reducing their willing ness to hire new workers however a few participants mentioned that their nonbank business contacts re ported that the bankingsector developments so far had not resulted in significant changes in their hiring and capital spending plans or sales expectations though their contacts also acknowledged increased uncertainties around their outlooks participants agreed that the labor market remained very tight job gains had picked up to a robust pace in janu ary and february and the unemployment rate remained low participants noted some signs of improvement in the imbalances between demand and supply in the labor market including further declines in the quits rate as well as an increase in the overall labor force participation rate and the return of the primeage participation rate to pre pandemic levels furthermore participants observed that wage growth appeared to be slowing gradually amid this apparent easing in labor demand and increase in la bor supply however participants assessed that labor demand continued to substantially exceed labor supply and several participants pointed out that wage growth minutes of the meeting of march page was still well above the rates that would be consistent over the longer run with the percent inflation objec tive given current estimates of trend productivity growth participants expected that under appropriate monetary policy supply and demand conditions in the labor market will come into better balance over time easing upward pressures on wages and prices with inflation still well above the committees longer run goal of percent participants agreed that inflation was unacceptably high participants commented that re cent inflation data indicated slowerthanexpected pro gress on disinflation in particular they noted that revi sions to the price data had indicated less disinflation at the end of last year than had been previously reported and that inflation was still quite elevated participants noted that on a month basis core goods price infla tion declined as supply chains continued to improve but the pace of the decline had slowed highlighting the still uncertain nature of the disinflationary process partici pants expected that housing services inflation would likely begin to slow in coming months reflecting contin ued smaller increases or potentially declines in rents on new leases regarding prices for core services excluding housing participants agreed that there was little evidence pointing to disinflation in this component participants generally judged that some more easing in labor market tightness and slowing in nominal wage growth would be necessary for sustained disinflation additionally partic ipants observed that indicators of shortterm inflation expectations from surveys of households and businesses had come down further while longerterm inflation ex pectations remained well anchored participants also discussed the potential effect on inflation of the devel opments in the banking sector they noted that a tight ening of credit conditions was likely to weigh on aggre gate demand which in turn could help reduce inflation ary pressures however participants observed that the size of such an effect was highly uncertain participants generally observed that the recent develop ments in the banking sector had further increased the alreadyhigh level of uncertainty associated with their outlooks for economic activity the labor market and in flation participants saw risks to economic activity as weighted to the downside as a source of downside risk to activity they noted the possibility that banks would reduce the supply of credit by more than expected which could restrain economic activity significantly participants mentioned potential intensification of rus sias war against ukraine as an additional source of downside risk to the economic outlook participants generally saw risks to inflation as weighted to the upside though they also recognized some downside risks to in flation as a source of upside risk to inflation partici pants cited the possibility of morepersistentthan anticipated price pressures due to for example surpris ingly resilient labor demand as a source of downside risk to inflation participants noted that if banks reduce the supply of credit by more than expected the likely restraint on economic activity and hiring could put addi tional downward pressure on inflation in their consideration of appropriate monetary policy ac tions at this meeting participants concurred that infla tion remained well above the committees longerrun goal of percent and that the recent data on inflation provided few signs that inflation pressures were abating at a pace sufficient to return inflation to percent over time participants also noted that recent developments in the banking sector would likely result in tighter credit conditions for households and businesses and weigh on economic activity hiring and inflation though the ex tent of these effects was highly uncertain against this backdrop all participants agreed that it was appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate ba sis points to to percent all participants also agreed that it was appropriate to continue the process of reduc ing the federal reserves securities holdings as de scribed in its previously announced plans for reducing the size of the federal reserves balance sheet several participants noted that in their policy delibera tions they considered whether it would be appropriate to hold the target range steady at this meeting they noted that doing so would allow more time to assess the financial and economic effects of recent bankingsector developments and of the cumulative tightening of mon etary policy however these participants also observed that the actions taken by the federal reserve in coordi nation with other government agencies helped calm con ditions in the banking sector and lessen the nearterm risks to economic activity and inflation consequently these participants judged it appropriate to increase the target range basis points because of elevated inflation the strength of the recent economic data and their com mitment to bring inflation down to the committees percent longerrun goal some participants noted that given persistently high in flation and the strength of the recent economic data they would have considered a basis point increase in the target range to have been appropriate at this meeting in the absence of the recent developments in the banking sector however due to the potential for bankingsector developments to tighten financial conditions and to page federal open market committee weigh on economic activity and inflation they judged it prudent to increase the target range by a smaller incre ment at this meeting these participants noted that do ing so would also allow the committee time to better assess the effects of bankingsector developments on credit conditions and the economy as the committee moved toward a sufficiently restrictive stance of mone tary policy participants observed that the actions taken by the fed eral reserve in coordination with other government agencies in the days preceding the meeting had served to calm conditions in the banking sector participants noted that the most significant issues appeared to have been limited to a small number of banks with poor risk management practices and that the banking system re mained sound and resilient participants emphasized that the federal reserve should use its liquidity and lenderoflastresort tools as well as its microprudential and macroprudential regulatory and supervisory tools to address stress in the banking sector and to mitigate fu ture financial stability risks participants agreed that re cent banking developments would factor into the com mittees monetary policy decisions to the extent that these developments affect the outlook for employment and inflation and the risks surrounding the outlook par ticipants reaffirmed their strong commitment to return ing inflation to the committees percent objective in discussing the policy outlook participants observed that inflation remained much too high and that the labor market remained tight as a result they anticipated that some additional policy firming may be appropriate to at tain a sufficiently restrictive policy stance to return infla tion to percent over time many participants noted that the likely effects of recent bankingsector develop ments on economic activity and inflation had led them to lower their assessments of the federal funds rate target range that would be sufficiently restrictive compared with assessments based solely on the recent economic data in determining the extent of future increases in the target range participants judged that it would be appro priate to take into account the cumulative tightening of monetary policy the lags with which monetary policy af fects economic activity and inflation and economic and financial developments in light of the highly uncertain economic outlook par ticipants underscored the importance of closely moni toring incoming information and assessing the implica tions for future monetary policy decisions participants noted that it would be particularly important to review incoming information regarding changes in credit con ditions and credit flows as well as broader changes in fi nancial conditions and to assess the implications for eco nomic activity labor markets and inflation several par ticipants emphasized the need to retain flexibility and optionality in determining the appropriate stance of monetary policy given the highly uncertain economic outlook participants emphasized a number of riskmanagement considerations related to the conduct of monetary pol icy some participants observed that downside risks to growth and upside risks to unemployment had increased because of the risk that bankingsector developments could lead to further tightening of credit conditions and weigh on economic activity some participants also noted that with inflation still well above the commit tees longerrun goal and the recent economic data re maining strong upside risks to the inflation outlook re mained a key factor shaping the policy outlook and that maintaining a restrictive policy stance until inflation is clearly on a downward path toward percent would be appropriate from a riskmanagement perspective sev eral participants noted the importance of longerterm in flation expectations remaining anchored and remarked that the longer inflation remained elevated the greater the risk of inflation expectations becoming unanchored participants generally agreed on the importance of closely monitoring incoming information and its impli cations for the economic outlook and that they were prepared to adjust their views on the appropriate stance of monetary policy in response to the incoming data and emerging risks to the economic outlook committee policy actions in their discussion of monetary policy for this meeting members agreed that recent indicators pointed to mod est growth in spending and production they also con curred that job gains had picked up in recent months and were running at a robust pace that the unemployment rate had remained low and that inflation remains ele vated members concurred that the us banking system is sound and resilient they also agreed that recent de velopments were likely to result in tighter credit condi tions for households and businesses and to weigh on economic activity hiring and

extent of future increases in the target range they would take into account the cu mulative tightening of monetary policy the lags with which monetary policy affects economic activity and in flation and economic and financial developments in addition members agreed that they would continue re ducing the federal reserves holdings of treasury secu rities and agency debt and agency mbs as described

as investor sentiment around the banking system stabilized on net nominal treasury yields declined equities appreciated credit spreads tightened and the tradeweighted value of the dollar de preciated measures of implied volatility declined across markets policysensitive rates however fluctu ated a fair amount over the period particularly in re sponse to economic data but also because of market perceptions of risk and liquidity conditions treasury market liquidity improved somewhat over the period but remained challenged treasury cash and futures markets continued to function in an orderly manner de spite the lowerthannormal liquidity regarding developments late in the intermeeting pe riod the closure and acquisition of first republic bank were seen as orderly though investors remained fo cused on stresses in the banking sector in addition the us treasury department announced it may not be able to fully satisfy the federal governments obligations as early as june if the debt limit is not raised or sus pended but that the actual date this event would occur might come a number of weeks later yields on treas ury bills and coupon securities maturing in the first half of june increased notably amid significant volatility deposit outflows from small and midsized banks largely stopped in late march and april although eq uity prices for regional banks fell further over the pe riod for the vast majority of banks these declines ap peared primarily to reflect expectations for lower prof itability rather than solvency concerns market partici pants remained alert to the possibility of another inten sification of banking stress responses to the open market desks survey of pri mary dealers and survey of market participants suggest that investors macroeconomic outlooks were little changed from march despite ongoing focus on the im plications of the expected tightening of credit re spondents saw upside inflation risks albeit less than in march market participants broadly expected a basis point rate increase at the may meeting and saw the resulting rate as the likely peak for the current tightening cycle survey respondents assigned a much higher probability to the peak federal funds rate being between and percent than they did in march however re spondents still assigned a substantial probability that the peak rate may turn out to be above percent re spondents expected the peak rate to be maintained through the january fomc meeting regarding the balance sheet and money markets bal ance sheet runoff continued to proceed smoothly and overnight secured and unsecured rates continued to trade well within the target range for the federal funds rate respondents to the desks surveys generally ex pected that overnight reverse repurchase agreement

rate providing a strong floor for money market rates balances at the on rrp facility remained within their recent range in dicating that use of the facility was not an important factor driving outflows of deposits from the banking system use of the on rrp facility declined at times over the intermeeting period in response to increases in rates on overnight secured money market instruments and on shortterm federal home loan bank debt the committee voted unanimously to renew the reciprocal currency arrangements with the bank of canada and the bank of mexico these arrangements are associated with the federal reserves participation in the north american framework agreement of in addition the committee voted unanimously to renew the dollar and foreign currency liquidity swap

regional indexes for new orders pointed to more softening in factory output in the com ing months foreign economic activity rebounded in the first quar ter reflecting the reopening of chinas economy from its covidrelated shutdowns a pickup in the econ omies of canada and mexico and the resilience of eu ropes economy to the energy price shock from russias war on ukraine a mild winter also helped reduce energy demand in europe in contrast economic growth else where in emerging asia was weak in the first quarter mainly due to a pronounced techcycle slowdown oil prices edged down amid concerns

first quarter of relative to its pace in in the april sloos banks reported further tightening of standards for most loan categories over the past three months following widespread tightening in pre vious quarters banks of all sizes expected their lending standards to tighten further for the rest of the most cited reason for tightening ci standards and terms was a less favorable or more uncertain economic outlook midsized banksthose that have total con solidated assets in the range of billion to bil liontightened ci standards more than other banks and additionally reported that a deterioration in their current or expected liquidity position was an important reason for their tightening such banks account for a bit over onefourth of ci lending banks of all sizes expected to tighten ci standards further over the re mainder of the year with small and midsized banks more widely reporting this expectation although cre loan growth on banks balance sheets remained robust in the first quarter the april sloos indicated that loan standards across all cre loan cate gories tightened further in the first quarter the re ported tightening in standards over the first quarter was particularly widespread for midsized banks banks also reported that they expected to tighten cre standards further over the remainder of the year with midsized banks very broadly reporting this expectation mean while commercial mortgagebacked securities cmbs issuance was very slow in february and march amid higher spreads and volatility as well as tighter lending standards credit remained broadly available in the residential mortgage market for highcreditscore borrowers who met standard conforming loan criteria but credit avail ability for households with lower credit scores remained tight in the april sloos the net percentages of banks reporting tighter standards for all consumer loan categories during the first quarter were elevated relative to their historical range and respondents expected that standards would continue to tighten over the remainder of even so consumer loans grew at a robust pace in the first quarter with a continued strong expansion in revolving credit balances overall the credit quality of most businesses and households remained solid but deteriorated somewhat for businesses with lower credit ratings and for house holds with lower credit scores the credit quality of ci and cre loans on banks balance sheets remained sound as of the end of the fourth quarter of last year however in the april sloos banks frequently cited concerns about a deterioration in the quality of their loan portfolios as a reason for expecting to tighten standards over the remainder of the year the staff provided an update on its assessment of the stability of the financial system the staff judged that the banking system was sound and resilient despite con cerns about profitability at some banks the staff judged that asset valuation pressures remained moder ate in particular the staff noted that the equity risk premium and corporate bond spreads declined over the past few months but remained near historical medians valuations in both residential and commercial property markets remained elevated rising borrowing costs had contributed to a moderation of price pressures in hous ing markets and yearoveryear house price increases had decelerated the staff noted that the cre sector remained vulnerable to large price declines this possi bility seemed particularly salient for office and down town retail properties given the shift toward telework in many industries the staff also noted analysis that found that while losses to cre debt holders could be moderate in aggregate some banks and the cmbs mar ket could experience stress should prices of these prop erties decline significantly the staff assessed that vulnerabilities associated with household leverage remained at moderate levels for nonfinancial businesses debt relative to nominal gdp declined some but continued to be near a historically high level the ability of nonfinancial firms to service their debt kept pace with rising debt loads and interest rates in terms of financialsector leverage going into the pe riod of recent bank stress banks of all sizes appeared strong with substantial lossabsorbing capacity as measured by regulatory capital ratios well above levels that prevailed before the great recession however the ratio of tangible common equity to total tangible as sets at banksexcluding global systemically important bankshad fallen sharply in recent quarters partly be cause of a substantial drop in the value of securities held in their portfolios the majority of the banking system had been able to effectively manage this interest rate risk exposure however the failure of three banks re sulting from poor interest rate risk and liquidity risk management had put stress on some additional banks for the nonbank sector leverage at large hedge funds remained somewhat elevated in the third quarter of page federal open market committee and more recent data from the senior credit of ficer opinion survey on dealer financing terms sug gested this fact had not changed with regard to vulnerabilities associated with funding risks the staff assessed that although funding strains had been notable for some banks such strains remained low for the banking system as a whole especially in light of official interventions by the federal reserve the federal deposit insurance corporation and the us department of treasury to support bank depositors outflows of funds from bank deposits in midmarch which were concentrated at a limited number of banks had slowed staff economic outlook the economic forecast prepared by the staff for the may fomc meeting continued to assume that the ef fects of the expected further tightening in bank credit conditions amid already tight financial conditions would lead to a mild recession starting later this year followed by a moderately paced recovery real gdp was projected to decelerate over the next two quarters before declining modestly in both the fourth quarter of this year and the first quarter of next year real gdp growth over and was projected to be below the staffs estimate of potential output growth the un employment rate was forecast to increase this year to peak next year and then to start declining gradually in resource utilization in both product and labor markets was forecast to loosen with the level of real output moving below the staffs estimate of potential output in early and the unemployment rate rising above the staffs estimate of its natural rate at that time the staffs core inflation forecast was revised up a little relative to the previous projection recent data for core pce goods prices and the eci measure of wage growththe latter of which importantly influences the staffs projection of core nonhousing services infla tioncame in above expectations and the staff judged that supplydemand imbalances in both goods markets and labor markets were easing a bit more slowly than anticipated on a fourquarter change basis total pce price inflation was projected to be percent this year with core inflation at percent core goods inflation was projected to move down further this year and then remain subdued housing services inflation was ex pected to have about peaked in the first quarter and to move down over the rest of the year and core nonhous ing services inflation was forecast to slow gradually as nominal wage growth eased further reflecting the pro jected effects of less tightness in resource utilization core inflation was forecast to slow through next year but remain moderately above percent with expected declines in consumer energy prices and a substantial moderation in food price inflation total inflation was projected to run below core inflation this year and next in both total and core pce price inflation were expected to be at about percent the staff continued to judge that uncertainty around the baseline projection was considerable and still viewed risks as being determined importantly by the im plications for macroeconomic conditions of develop ments in the banking sector if bankingsector stress were to abate more quickly or have less of an effect on macroeconomic conditions than assumed in the base line then the risks would be tilted to the upside for eco nomic activity and inflation a scenario that the staff viewed as only a little less likely than the baseline if banking and financial conditions and their effects on macroeconomic conditions were to deteriorate more than assumed in the baseline then the risks around the baseline would be skewed to the downside for eco nomic activity and inflation on balance the staff saw the risks around the baseline inflation forecast as tilted to the upside as an upside economic scenario with higher inflation appeared more likely than a downside scenario with lower inflation and because inflation could continue to be more persistent than expected and inflation expectations could become unanchored after a long period of elevated inflation participants views on current conditions and the economic outlook in their discussion of current economic conditions par ticipants noted that economic activity had expanded at a modest pace in the first quarter nonetheless job gains had been robust in recent months and the unem ployment rate had remained low inflation remained elevated participants agreed that the us banking sys tem was sound and resilient they commented that tighter credit conditions for households and businesses were likely to weigh on economic activity hiring and inflation however participants agreed that the extent of these effects remained uncertain against this back ground participants concurred that they remained highly attentive to inflation risks in assessing the economic outlook participants noted that the growth rate of real gdp in the first quarter of this year was modest despite a pickup in consumer spending as inventory investmenta volatile cate gorydeclined substantially participants generally ex pected real gdp to grow at a pace below its longerrun minutes of the meeting of may page trend rate in reflecting the effects of restrictive financial conditions participants assessed that the cu mulative tightening of monetary policy over the past year had contributed significantly to more restrictive fi nancial conditions they also judged that bankingsec tor stress would likely weigh further on economic activ ity but the extent to which that would be the case re mained highly uncertain with inflation well above the committees longerrun percent objective and core inflation showing only some signs of moderation par ticipants expected that a period of belowtrend growth in real gdp and some softening in labor market condi tions would be needed to bring aggregate supply and aggregate demand into better balance and reduce infla tionary pressures over time participants generally noted that the actions taken by the federal reserve and other government agencies in response to developments in the banking sector had been effective in largely reducing stress they noted that conditions in the banking sector had broadly im proved since early march with the initial deposit out flows experienced by some regional and smaller banks moderating substantially over subsequent weeks many participants commented that the recent developments in the banking sector had contributed to some tighten ing of lending standards beyond that which had oc curred during previous quarters especially among small and midsized banks some participants noted that small businesses tend to rely on small and midsized banks as primary sources of credit and therefore may disproportionally bear the effects of tighter lending conditions some participants mentioned that access to credit had not yet appeared to have declined signifi cantly since the recent onset of stress in the banking sector participants judged that stress in the banking sector would in coming quarters likely induce banks to tighten lending standards by more than they would have in response to higher interest rates alone however participants generally noted that it was too early to as sess with confidence the magnitude and persistence of these effects on economic activity in their discussion of the household sector participants noted that consumer spending showed strength in the first quarter supported by gains in personal disposable income they also remarked that the quarterly strength was driven mainly by very strong spending growth in january while real spending fell modestly over february and march consistent with that slowing participants anticipated that consumer spending would likely grow at a subdued rate over the remainder of reflecting in large part the effects of the tightening in financial conditions over the past year participants remarked that higher interest rates would continue to restrain in terestsensitive expenditures by households such as those on housing and durable goods participants also noted that the rise in uncertainty associated with recent developments in the banking sector could weigh on consumer sentiment and spending however several participants observed that highfrequency measures of consumer sentiment had not yet shown significant changes following the bankingsector developments a few participants remarked that there had been some on going reduction in consumers discretionary expendi tures in the face of elevated inflation and higher bor rowing rates especially among lower and middlein come households some of those declines were report edly driven by shifts in purchases toward lowercost op tions regarding the business sector participants observed that growth in business fixed investment was subdued in the first quarter reflecting relatively high borrowing costs weak growth of businesssector output and busi nesses increasing concerns about the general economic outlook participants expected the tightening of bank lending standards to weigh further on firms capital ex penditures several participants noted that based on reports from their district contacts concerns related to bankingsector stress could add more uncertainty to an already soft economic outlook increasing firms cau tion especially at smaller and midsized firms that rely heavily on bank credit to finance their operations however some other participants mentioned that de velopments in the banking sector appeared to have had only a modest effect so far on credit availability for firms participants noted that the labor market remained very tight with robust payroll gains in march and an unem ployment rate near historically low levels nevertheless they noted some signs that the imbalance of supply and demand in the labor market was easing with primeage labor force participation returning to its prepandemic level and further reductions in the rates of job openings and quits in addition some participants noted that their district contacts reported less difficulty in hiring lower turnover rates and some layoffs participants an ticipated that employment growth would likely slow further reflecting a moderation in aggregate demand coming partly from tighter credit conditions partici pants remarked that although nominal wage growth ap peared to be slowing gradually it was still running at a pace that given current estimates of trend productivity growth was well above what would be consistent over page federal open market committee the longer run with the committees percent inflation objective participants generally anticipated that under appropriate monetary policy imbalances in the labor market would gradually diminish easing pressures on wages and prices participants agreed that inflation was unacceptably high they commented that data through march indi cated that declines in inflation particularly for measures of core inflation had been slower than they had ex pected participants observed that although core goods inflation had moderated since the middle of last year it had decelerated less rapidly than expected in recent months despite reports from several business contacts of supply chain constraints continuing to ease addi tionally participants emphasized that core nonhousing services inflation had shown few signs of slowing in the past few months some participants remarked that a further easing in labor market conditions would be needed to help bring down inflation in this component regarding housing services inflation participants ob served that soft readings on rents for leases signed by new tenants were starting to feed into measured infla tion they expected that this process would continue and would help lead to a decline in housing services in flation over this year in discussing the likely effects on inflation of recent bankingsector developments sev eral participants remarked that tighter credit conditions may not put much downward pressure on inflation in part because lower credit availability could restrain ag gregate supply as well as aggregate demand several participants noted that longerterm measures of infla tion expectations from surveys of households and busi nesses remained well anchored participants empha sized that with appropriate firming of monetary policy wellanchored longerterm inflation expectations would support a return of inflation to the committees per cent longerrun goal participants noted that risks associated with the recent banking stress had led them to raise their already high assessment of uncertainty around their economic out looks participants judged that risks to the outlook for economic activity were weighted to the downside al though a few noted the risks were two sided in dis cussing sources of downside risk to economic activity participants referenced the possibility that the cumula tive tightening of monetary policy could affect eco nomic activity more than expected and that further strains in the banking sector could prove more substan tial than anticipated some participants also noted con cerns that the statutory limit on federal debt might not be raised in a timely manner threatening significant dis ruptions to the financial system and tighter financial conditions that weaken the economy regarding risks to inflation participants cited the possibility that price pressures could prove more persistent than anticipated because of for example strongerthanexpected con sumer spending and a tight labor market especially if the effect of bank stress on economic activity proved modest however a few participants cited the possibil ity that further tightening of credit conditions could slow household spending and reduce business invest ment and hiring all of which would support the ongo ing rebalancing of supply and demand in product and labor markets and reduce inflation pressures in their discussion of financial stability various partici pants commented on recent developments in the bank ing sector these participants noted that the banking system was sound and resilient that actions taken by the federal reserve in coordination with other govern ment agencies had served to calm conditions in that sec tor but that stresses remained a number of partici pants noted that the banking sector was well capitalized overall and that the most significant issues in the bank ing system appeared to be limited to a small number of banks with poor riskmanagement practices or substan tial exposure to specific vulnerabilities these vulnera bilities included significant unrealized losses on assets resulting from rising interest rates heavy reliance on un insured deposits or strained profitability amid higher funding costs some participants additionally noted that because of weak fundamentals for cre such as high vacancy rates in the office segment high exposure to such assets was a vulnerability for some banks par ticipants also commented on the susceptibility of some nonbank financial institutions to runs or instability these included money market funds which had re cently experienced large cash inflows hedge funds which tend to use substantial leverage and may hold concentrated positions in some assets with low or zero margin thinly capitalized nonbank mortgage servicers and digital asset entities many participants mentioned that it is essential that the debt limit be raised in a timely manner to avoid the risk of severely adverse disloca tions in the financial system and the broader economy a few participants noted the importance of orderly functioning of the market for us treasury securities or stressed the importance of the appropriate authori ties continuing to address issues related to the resilience of the market a number of participants emphasized that the federal reserve should maintain readiness to use its liquidity tools as well as its microprudential and minutes of the meeting of may page macroprudential regulatory and supervisory tools to mitigate future financial stability risks in their consideration of appropriate monetary policy actions at this meeting participants concurred that in flation remained substantially elevated relative to the committees longerrun goal of percent economic activity had expanded at a modest pace in the first quar ter the labor market continued to be tight with robust job gains in recent months and the unemployment rate remained low participants also noted that recent de velopments in the banking sector would likely result in tighter credit conditions for households and businesses which would weigh on economic activity hiring and inflation however the extent of these effects re mained uncertain against this backdrop all partici pants agreed that it was appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate basis points to per cent to percent all participants agreed that it was also appropriate to continue the process of reducing the federal reserves securities holdings as described in its previously announced plans for reducing the size of the federal reserves balance sheet in discussing the policy outlook participants generally agreed that in light of the lagged effects of cumulative tightening in monetary policy and the potential effects on the economy of a further tightening in credit condi tions the extent to which additional increases in the tar get range may be appropriate after this meeting had be come less certain participants agreed that it would be important to closely monitor incoming information and assess the implications for monetary policy in deter mining the extent to which additional policy firming may be appropriate to return inflation to percent over time various participants noted specific factors that should bear on future decisions on policy actions one such factor was the degree and timing with which cu mulative policy tightening restrained economic activity and reduced inflation with some participants com menting that they saw evidence that the past years tightening was beginning to have its intended effect another factor was the degree to which tighter credit conditions for households and businesses resulting from events in the banking sector would weigh on ac tivity and reduce inflation which participants agreed was very uncertain additional factors included the progress toward returning inflation to the committees longerrun goal of percent and the pace at which la bor market conditions softened and economic growth slowed participants also discussed several riskmanagement considerations that could bear on future policy deci sions a few assessed that there were upside risks to economic growth however almost all participants commented that downside risks to growth and upside risks to unemployment had increased because of the possibility that bankingsector developments could lead to further tightening of credit conditions and weigh on economic activity almost all participants stated that with inflation still well above the committees longer run goal and the labor market remaining tight upside risks to the inflation outlook remained a key factor shaping the policy outlook a few participants noted that they also saw some downside risks to inflation taking into account these various considerations par ticipants discussed their views on the extent to which further policy firming after the current meeting may be appropriate participants generally expressed uncer tainty about how much more policy tightening may be appropriate many participants focused on the need to retain optionality after this meeting some participants commented that based on their expectations that pro gress in returning inflation to percent could continue to be unacceptably slow additional policy firming would likely be warranted at future meetings several participants noted that if the economy evolved along the lines of their current outlooks then further policy firming after this meeting may not be necessary in light of the prominent risks to the committees objec tives with respect to both maximum employment and price stability participants generally noted the im portance of closely monitoring incoming information and its implications for the economic outlook participants discussed the importance and various as pects of clearly explaining monetary policy actions and strategy all participants reaffirmed their strong com mitment to returning inflation to the committees percent objective over time and remained highly at tentive to inflation risks a few participants com mented that recent monetary policy actions and com munications had helped keep inflation expectations well anchored which they saw as important for the attain ment of the committees goals participants empha sized the importance of communicating to the public the datadependent approach of policymakers and the vast majority of participants commented that the ad justed language in the postmeeting statement was help ful in that respect some participants stressed that it was crucial to communicate that the language in the postmeeting statement should not be interpreted as sig naling either that decreases in the target range are likely page federal open market committee this year or that further increases in the target range had been ruled out committee policy actions in their discussion of monetary policy for this meeting members agreed that economic activity had expanded at a modest pace in the first quarter they also con curred that job gains had been robust in recent months and the unemployment rate had remained low infla tion had remained elevated members concurred that the us banking system was sound and resilient they also agreed that tighter credit conditions for households and businesses were likely to weigh on economic activity hiring and inflation but that the extent of these effects was uncertain members also concurred that they remained highly attentive to in flation risks members agreed that the committee seeks to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of percent over the longer run in support of these goals the members agreed to raise the target range for the federal funds rate to to percent members agreed to closely monitor incoming information and as sess the implications for monetary policy in determin ing the extent to which additional policy firming may be appropriate to return inflation to percent over time members concurred that they will take into account the cumulative tightening of monetary policy the lags with which monetary policy affects economic activity and in flation and economic and financial developments in addition members agreed that they will continue reduc ing the federal reserves holdings of treasury securities and agency debt and agency mortgagebacked securi ties as described in its previously announced plans all members affirmed that they are strongly committed to returning inflation to their percent objective members agreed that in assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy they would continue to mon itor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook they would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the com mittees goals members also agreed that their assess ments will take into account a wide range of infor mation

financial markets and open market operations the manager turned first to a review of developments in financial markets policysensitive rates increased over the intermeeting period reflecting indications of contin ued resilience in the economy persistently elevated core inflation and reduced downside tail risks following the resolution of the debt limit the shift in policy expecta tions contributed significantly to higher treasury yields the increase in nominal yields primarily reflected higher real rates rather than inflation compensation broad eq uity prices rose although the outperformance was con centrated in a handful of companies with a large market capitalization cyclical sectors fared better than sectors that tend to appreciate in a downturn suggesting some reduced investor concern about downside risks to growth investor sentiment about the banking sector improved as perceived tail risks regarding regional banks appeared to have receded equity prices for regional banks rose over the intermeeting period but were still well below early march levels financial conditions in dexes were roughly unchanged as higher rates and a stronger dollar were offset by higher equity prices and narrower credit spreads the vast majority of respondents to the open market desks surveys of primary dealers and market partici pants expected no rate change at this meeting while the median path from the surveys pointed to no rate changes through early there was significant dispersion across respondents and respondents saw a clear proba bility of additional tightening at coming meetings re spondents average probability distribution for the level of the peak policy rate shifted higher since the may meet ing and respondents on average assigned about per cent probability to the peak being above the current tar get range the marketimplied path for the policy rate continued to show some decline this year but less so than it had in recent months measures of uncertainty about the path of the policy rate derived from options remained very elevated though they came down some over the intermeeting period desk survey respondents still saw a recession occurring in the near term as quite likely but the expected timing was again pushed later as economic data pointed to the continued resilience of economic activity overall re spondents generally continued to expect that any down turn would be neither deep nor prolonged with regard to inflation expectations respondents marked up their projections for quarterly core personal consumption ex penditures pce inflation in the second and third quar ters of this year while projections for later quarters were little changed the manager then turned to money market develop ments and policy implementation the median respond ent to the desk surveys expected the threemonth bill yield to increase slightly relative to the similarmaturity overnight index swap ois rate and to remain above it into the fourth quarter this expectation likely reflected a combination of rising net supply of bills as part of the treasury departments plan to rebuild the treasury general account tga following the resolution of the debt limit and expectations for healthy investor demand for bills the overnight reverse repurchase agreement on rrp facility which continued to support effective policy implementation and control over the federal funds rate saw somewhat lower participation since the resolution of the debt limit consistent with the historical experience that on rrp participation is typically re sponsive to changes in money market conditions the median respondent to the desks survey of primary dealers expected on rrp participation to trend lower over the rest of this year the staff assessed that the replenishment of the tga and the ongoing balance sheet runoff among other factors were likely to subtract from reserves more than the decline in on rrp partic ipation would add to them on net the staff judged that reserves at the end of the year were likely to remain abundant uncertainty surrounding the outlooks for both reserves and on rrp participation was substan tial by unanimous vote the committee ratified the desks domestic transactions over the intermeeting period there were no intervention operations in foreign curren cies for the systems account during the intermeeting pe riod staff review of the economic situation the information available at the time of the june meeting suggested that real gross domestic product gdp was expanding at a modest pace in the second quarter labor market conditions

elevated in april labor market conditions remained tight in april and may total nonfarm payroll employment increased at a robust pace during those two months the unemploy ment rate edged up on net but was still at a low level of percent in may on balance the unemployment rate minutes of the meeting of june page for african americans moved up to percent while the jobless rate for hispanics moved

dallas was percent in april surveybased measures of longerterm inflation expectations in may from the uni versity of michigan surveys of consumers and the fed eral reserve bank of new yorks survey of consumer expectations remained within the range of their values reported in the decade before the pandemic nearterm measures of inflation expectations from these surveys moved down in may and continued to be below their peaks seen last year real gdp appeared to be increasing modestly in the sec ond quarter following its stronger firstquarter gain pri vate domestic final purchases pdfpwhich includes pce residential investment and business fixed invest ment and often provides a better signal of underlying economic momentum than gdplooked to be ex panding more slowly in the second quarter than its ro bust firstquarter pace for the first half as a whole pdfp growth seemed to be more resilient than in the second half of last year the annual revisions to international trade statistics sug gested that net exports contributed positively to us real gdp growth in the first quarter with real exports re bounding more strongly than real imports following their fourthquarter declines in april however the nominal trade deficit widened notably as nominal ex ports decreased and nominal imports rose further foreign economic growth rebounded in the first quarter reflecting in part the reopening of chinas economy from its covidrelated shutdowns and strong servicessector activity in other asian countries canada and mexico in the euro area however real gdp con tracted modestly for a second consecutive quarter amid a pullback in consumer spending indicators pointed to a stepdown in the pace of foreign economic growth in the second quarter with the impetus from chinas reo pening dissipating and global manufacturing activity re maining weak global prices for energy and agricultural commodities were little changed on net over the intermeeting period while prices for metals fell further declines in retail en ergy prices since the beginning of the year contributed to a notable easing in headline consumer price inflation in the foreign economies by contrast core inflation had yet to materially decline from its recent highs in many economies in this context and with tight labor market conditions foreign central banks underscored the need to raise policy rates further or hold them at sufficiently restrictive levels to bring inflation back to their respec tive targets and be well positioned in case inflation failed to decline as expected staff review of the financial situation over the intermeeting period market participants ap peared to interpret incoming data as signaling on bal ance more resilience in economic activity than previ ously assumed and viewed communications from fomc participants overall as pointing to a tighter path for policy than expected as a result treasury yields and the expected future path for the federal funds rate shifted upward significantly meanwhile broad equity prices also increased notably financing conditions re mained moderately restrictive but credit availability gen erally remained solid the expected path of the policy rate implied by market quotes moved up notably over the intermeeting period page federal open market committee a straight read of federal funds futures rates suggested that market participants expected that the federal funds rate would be roughly flat over the course of the rest of this year the yearend expected rate was about basis points higher than the yearend expectation before the may fomc meeting beyond this year the policy rate path implied by ois quotes also moved up to about percent by the end of similarly nominal treasury yields rose significantly the rise in nominal yields mostly reflected an increase in real yields as measures of inflation compensation were little changed on net amid somewhat mixed news on inflation measures of uncertainty about the path of interest rates remained very elevated by historical standards the sp stock price index increased sizably on net over the intermeeting period led by technologyrelated stocks the vixthe onemonth optionimplied

period stock prices for large banks were only somewhat below their levels before the failure of silicon valley bank svb while those for regional banks remained below their lev els in early march marketbased policy rate expectations rose notably in most advanced foreign economies as core inflation data surprised to the upside in some countries and central bank communications were perceived as pointing to more restrictive policy than expected notwithstanding the rise in global yields foreign equity prices credit spreads and risk sentiment in foreign markets were little changed over the intermeeting period the staffs trade weighted broad dollar index was also little changed on net but the exchange value of the dollar appreciated sig nificantly against the chinese renminbi amid increased investor concerns over chinas economic growth pro spects conditions in overnight bank funding and repurchase agreement markets remained generally stable over the in termeeting period the basis point increase in admin istered rates at the may fomc meeting fully passed through to overnight money market rates spreads and issuance volumes in unsecured shortterm funding mar kets stayed within their typical ranges in may yields of treasury bills maturing in june and thus potentially af fected by the federal debt limit rose sharply before largely retracing those increases after an agreement was reached to suspend the debt limit in domestic credit markets borrowing costs for busi nesses households and municipalities increased notably over the intermeeting period interest rates on newly originated bank loans to businesses and households in the first quarter rose further above their peaks from the previous tightening cycle and yields on leveraged loans also rose reaching levels close to their peak at the onset of the pandemic rates also moved up on a broad array of fixedincome securities including investment and speculativegrade corporate bonds municipal bonds both agency and nonagency commercial mortgage backed securities cmbs and agency residential mortgagebacked securities the increases in yields on these instruments over the intermeeting period were generally in line with or less than the changes in their treasury benchmarks small businesses and households saw continued increases in their borrowing costs rates on year conforming residential mortgages stepped up broadly in line with increases in comparableduration treasury yields interest rates on credit card offers con tinued to rise through april and auto loan interest rates moved sideways during the intermeeting period both credit card and auto loan interest rates stood at or near their highest levels since the global financial crisis banks ability to fund loans to businesses and consumers appeared to have stabilized in recent weeks but remained somewhat strained relative to before the closure of svb in march although banks continued to experience out flows of core deposits the pace of those outflows mod erated substantially relative to march suggesting some easing of bank funding pressures banks also continued to attract inflows of large time deposits reflecting higher interest rates on new certificates of deposit total bank assets were little changed on net over the intermeeting period in capital markets funding had generally been resilient issuance of nonfinancial investmentgrade corporate bonds rose at a robust pace in may after slowing in april partly due to the earnings blackout period specula tivegrade issuance increased in late april and in may but remained subdued by historical standards gross issu ance of municipal bonds was solid in april and may conditions in the leveraged loan and cmbs markets were somewhat more strained leveraged loan issuance remained subdued reflecting weak investor demand amid concerns over the credit worthiness of borrowers both agency and nonagency cmbs issuance volumes were low in may relative to prepandemic levels in ad dition for small businesses credit availability continued to show signs of tightening minutes of the meeting of june page credit remained easily available in the residential mort gage market for high credit score borrowers who met standard conforming loan criteria for borrowers with lower scores credit availability tightened slightly in april but remained close to prepandemic levels in consumer credit markets conditions stayed generally accommoda tive with credit available for most borrowers the credit quality of most businesses and households re mained solid although market participants appeared to expect some deterioration in the coming quarters which could weaken lender balance sheets and possibly weigh on credit availability a measure of the may cmbs de linquency rate showed about a basis point increase driven by a sharp rise in the delinquency rate for office buildings staff economic outlook the economic forecast prepared by the staff for the june fomc meeting continued to assume that the effects of the expected further tightening in bank credit condi tions amid already tight financial conditions would lead to a mild recession starting later this year followed by a moderately paced recovery real gdp was projected to decelerate in the current quarter and the next one before declining modestly in both the fourth quarter of this year and first quarter of next year real gdp growth over and was projected to be below the staffs es timate of potential output growth the unemployment rate was forecast to increase this year peak next year and remain near that level through current tight resource utilization in both product and labor markets was forecast to ease with the level of real output moving below the staffs estimate of potential output in and the unemployment rate rising above the staffs estimate of its natural rate at that time the staffs inflation forecast was little revised relative to the previous projection and supplydemand imbalances in both goods markets and labor markets were still judged to be easing only slowly on a fourquarter change basis total pce price inflation was projected to be percent this year with core inflation at per cent core goods inflation was forecast to move down further this year and then remain subdued housing ser vices inflation was considered to have about peaked and was expected to move down over the rest of the year core nonhousing services inflation was projected to slow gradually as nominal wage growth eased further reflecting the effects of the easing in resource utilization over the projection core inflation was forecast to slow through next year but remain moderately above per cent with expected declines in consumer energy prices and further moderation in food price inflation total in flation was projected to run below core inflation this year and the next in both total and core pce price inflation were expected to be close to percent the staff continued to judge that uncertainty around the baseline projection was considerable and still viewed the risks as being influenced importantly by the potential macroeconomic implications of bankingsector develop ments which could end up being more or less negative than assumed in the baseline given the continued strength in labor market conditions and the resilience of consumer spending however the staff saw the possibil ity of the economy continuing to grow slowly and avoid ing a downturn as almost as likely as the mildrecession baseline on balance the staff saw the risks around the baseline inflation forecast as tilted to the upside as eco nomic scenarios with higher inflation appeared more likely than scenarios with lower inflation and because in flation could continue to be more persistent than ex pected and inflation expectations could become unan chored after a long period of elevated inflation participants views on current conditions and the economic outlook in conjunction with this fomc meeting participants submitted their projections of the most likely outcomes for real gdp growth the unemployment rate and infla tion for each year from through and over the longer run the projections were based on their individ ual assessments of appropriate monetary policy includ ing the path of the federal funds rate the longerrun projections represented each participants assessment of the rate to which each variable would be expected to converge over time under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy a summary of economic projections sep was released to the public following the conclusion of the meeting in their discussion of current economic conditions par ticipants noted that economic activity had continued to expand at a modest pace nonetheless job gains had been robust in recent months and the unemployment rate had remained low inflation remained elevated participants agreed that the us banking system was sound and resilient they commented that tighter credit conditions for households and businesses were likely to weigh on economic activity hiring and inflation how ever participants agreed that the extent of these effects remained uncertain against this background partici pants concurred that they remained highly attentive to inflation risks page federal open market committee in assessing the economic outlook most participants noted that real gdp growth had been resilient in recent quarters participants generally judged that growth would be subdued over the remainder of this year they assessed that the cumulative tightening of monetary pol icy over the past year had contributed significantly to more restrictive financial conditions and lower demand in the most interest rate sensitive sectors of the econ omy especially housing and business investment par ticipants also acknowledged uncertainty about the lags with which monetary policy affects the economy and discussed the extent to which the full effects of mone tary tightening on the economy had been realized while total inflation had moderated over the past year core in flation had not shown a sustained easing since the begin ning of the year with inflation well above the commit tees longerrun percent objective participants ex pected that a period of belowtrend growth in real gdp and some softening in labor market conditions would be needed to bring aggregate supply and aggregate demand into better balance and reduce inflationary pressures suf ficiently to return inflation to percent over time participants generally noted that banking stresses had re ceded and conditions in the banking sector were much improved since early march participants generally con tinued to judge that a tightening in credit conditions spurred by bankingsector stress earlier in the year would likely weigh further on economic activity but the extent remained uncertain several participants mentioned that credit conditions had not appeared to have tightened sig nificantly beyond what would be expected in response to the monetary policy actions taken since early last year some participants judged that it was still too early to as sess with confidence the eventual effects of tighter bank credit conditions on economic activity and noted that it would be important to monitor closely the potential ef fects of bankingsector developments on credit condi tions and economic activity in their discussion of the household sector participants generally noted that consumer spending so far this year had been stronger than expected several participants noted that aggregate household wealth remained high as equity and home prices had not declined much from their recent highs a few participants mentioned that while overall the household sector still retained much of the excess savings it had accumulated during the pan demic there were signs that consumers were facing in creasingly tighter budget constraints given high inflation and especially for lowincome households depleted sav ings regarding the business sector various participants said that reports from their contacts were mixed with some pointing to softening economic conditions and others indicating greaterthanexpected strength many partic ipants noted that developments in the banking sector ap peared to have had only a modest effect so far on credit availability for firms some participants remarked that the effect of high interest rates on the housing sector ap peared to be bottoming out with home sales builder sentiment and new construction all having improved a little since the start of the year in their discussion of economic activity several partici pants pointed out that recent gdp readings had been stronger than expected earlier in the year while gross domestic income gdi readings had been weak of those who noted the discrepancy between gdp and gdi most suggested that economic momentum may not be as strong as indicated by the gdp readings in discussing that possibility a couple of these participants also cited the recent subdued growth in aggregate hours worked participants noted that labor market conditions re mained very tight with robust payroll gains and the un employment rate still near historically low levels nev ertheless they noted some signs that supply and demand in the labor market were coming into better balance with the primeage labor force participation rate moving up in recent months and further reductions in rates of job openings and quits and declines in average weekly hours a couple of participants conveyed that they heard at a recent fed listens event that in various parts of the country the lack of affordable housing in the area was preventing some lowerincome workers from relo cating to accept jobs similarly a few participants noted that their district contacts reported less difficulty in hir ing and retaining workers lower turnover rates and some layoffs some participants pointed out that payroll gains had remained robust but noted that some other measures of employmentsuch as those based on the bureau of labor statistics household survey the quar terly census of employment and wages or the board staffs measure of private employment using data from the payroll processing firm adpsuggested that job growth may have been weaker than indicated by payroll employment participants anticipated that employment growth would likely slow further consistent with their projections of belowtrend economic growth partici pants noted that nominal wage growth had shown signs of easing but observed that it was still running at a pace that given current estimates of trend productivity growth was above what would be consistent over the minutes of the meeting of june page longer run with the committees percent inflation ob jective participants expected supply and demand con ditions in the labor market to come into better balance over time easing pressures on wages and prices participants agreed that inflation was unacceptably high and noted that the data including the cpi for may indi cated that declines in inflation had been slower than they had expected participants observed that although core goods inflation had moderated since the middle of last year it had slowed less rapidly than expected in recent months despite data and reports from business contacts indicating that supply chain constraints had continued to ease some participants noted the recent moderation in housing services inflation and expected this trend to continue however a few participants pointed to upside risks to the outlook for housing services inflation asso ciated with nearrecord low inventories of homes for sale solid housing demand and lessthanexpected de celeration recently in measures of rents for leases signed by new tenants additionally some participants re marked that core nonhousing services inflation had shown few signs of slowing in the past few months sev eral participants noted that longerterm measures of in flation expectations from surveys of households and businesses remained well anchored participants empha sized that with appropriate firming of monetary policy wellanchored longerterm inflation expectations would support a return of inflation to the committees per cent longerrun goal over time participants generally noted a high degree of uncertainty regarding the cumulative effects on the economy from both alreadyenacted monetary policy tightening and the potential additional tightening in credit conditions stem ming from recent bankingsector developments partic ipants noted that the full effects of monetary tightening had likely yet to be observed though several highlighted the possibility that much of the effect of past monetary policy tightening may have already been realized re garding downside risks to economic activity participants noted the possibility that the cumulative and rapid tight ening of monetary policy would eventually affect eco nomic activity more than expected and that the addi tional effects of the tightening of bank credit conditions could prove more substantial than anticipated regard ing risks to inflation with inflation remaining well above the committees longerrun goal some participants mentioned the possibility that longerterm inflation ex pectations could become unanchored particularly in light of strongerthanexpected consumer demand and a stilltight labor market several participants cited the possibility of delayed effects of tighter credit conditions potentially contributing to a slowdown in economic ac tivity that reduces inflationary pressures in their consideration of appropriate monetary policy ac tions at this meeting participants concurred that while inflation had moderated since the middle of it re mained well above the committees longerrun goal of percent economic activity had continued to expand at a modest pace the labor market remained very tight with robust job gains in recent months and the unem ployment rate still low but there were some signs that supply and demand in the labor market were coming into better balance the economy was facing headwinds from tighter credit conditions including higher interest rates for households and businesses which would likely weigh on economic activity hiring and inflation al though the extent of these effect remained uncertain against this backdrop and in consideration of the sig nificant cumulative tightening in the stance of monetary policy and the lags with which policy affects economic activity and inflation almost all participants judged it ap propriate or acceptable to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at to percent at this meeting most of these participants observed that leaving the tar get range unchanged at this meeting would allow them more time to assess the economys progress toward the committees goals of maximum employment and price stability some participants indicated that they favored raising the target range for the federal funds rate basis points at this meeting or that they could have supported such a proposal the participants favoring a basis point increase noted that the labor market remained very tight momentum in economic activity had been stronger than earlier anticipated and there were few clear signs that inflation was on a path to return to the committees percent objective over time all participants agreed that it was appropriate to continue the process of reduc ing the federal reserves securities holdings as de scribed in its previously announced plans for reducing the size of the federal reserves balance sheet in discussing the policy outlook all participants contin ued to anticipate that with inflation still well above the committees percent goal and the labor market re maining very tight maintaining a restrictive stance for monetary policy would be appropriate to achieve the committees objectives almost all participants noted that in their economic projections that they judged that additional increases in the target federal funds rate dur ing would be appropriate most participants ob served that uncertainty about the outlook for the econ omy and inflation remained elevated and that additional page federal open market committee information would be valuable for considering the ap propriate stance of monetary policy many also noted that after rapidly tightening the stance of monetary pol icy last year the committee had slowed the pace of tight ening and that a further moderation in the pace of policy firming was appropriate in order to provide additional time to observe the effects of cumulative tightening and assess their implications for policy participants agreed that their policy decisions at every meeting would con tinue to be based on the totality of incoming information and its implications for the economic outlook as well as the balance of risks they also emphasized the im portance of communicating to the public their data dependent approach most participants observed that postmeeting communications including the sep would help clarify their assessment regarding the stance of monetary policy that is likely to be appropriate to bring inflation down to percent over time participants also discussed several riskmanagement considerations that could bear on future policy deci sions almost all participants stated that with inflation still well above the committees longerrun goal and the labor market remaining tight upside risks to the inflation outlook or the possibility that persistently high inflation might cause inflation expectations to become unan chored remained key factors shaping the policy outlook even though economic activity had been resilient re cently and that the labor market remained strong some participants commented that there continued to be downside risks to economic growth and upside risks to unemployment despite the receding of the stresses in the banking sector some participants commented that it would be important to monitor whether developments in the banking sector lead to further tightening of credit conditions and weigh on economic activity some par ticipants noted concerns about the potential risks stem ming from weakness in commercial real estate a number of participants observed that the resolution of the federal government debt limit had removed one source of significant uncertainty for the economic out look a few participants noted that there could be some upward pressure on money market rates in the near term as the treasury issued more bills to meet expenditures and return the balance in the tga to the treasurys pre ferred level those participants observed that upward pressure on money market rates relative to the rate of fered on the on rrp facility could lead to a decline in usage of the facility committee policy actions in their discussion of

developments in financial markets and open market operations the manager turned first to a review of developments in financial markets over the intermeeting period market participants interpreted data releases as generally demonstrating economic resilience and a further easing of inflation pressures the marketimplied peak for the federal funds rate rose in response to data pointing to a robust economy but retraced part of that move after the june consumer price index cpi release was interpreted by market participants as softer than anticipated even as market prices shifted to indicate a slightly more re page federal open market committee strictive expected policy path broader financial condi tions eased a bit reflecting in large part gains in equity prices and tighter credit spreads notably share prices for bank equity also appreciated over the intermeeting period as concerns about the banking sector continued to dissipate spot and forward measures of inflation compensation based on treasury inflationprotected securities were little changed over the intermeeting pe riod at levels broadly consistent with the committees percent longerrun goal and longerterm survey and marketbased measures continued to point to inflation expectations being firmly anchored marketimplied peak policy rates in most advanced foreign economies afes rose further this period and the dollar depreci ated modestly respondents to the open market desks survey of pri mary dealers and survey of market participants in july continued to place significant probability of a recession occurring by the end of however the timing of a recession expected by survey respondents was again pushed later and the probability of avoiding a recession through grew noticeably survey respondents an ticipated that both headline and core personal consump tion expenditures pce inflation will decline to per cent by the end of there was a strong anticipation evident in both market based measures and responses to the desks surveys that the committee would raise the target range basis points at the july fomc meeting most survey respond ents had a modal expectation that a july rate hike would be the last of this tightening cycle although most re spondents also perceived that additional monetary pol icy tightening after the july fomc meeting was possible as inferred from their responses survey respondents ex pected real rates to increase through the first half of and to remain above their expectations for the longrun neutral levels for a few years the manager then turned to money market develop ments and policy implementation the overnight re verse repurchase agreement on rrp facility contin ued to work as intended over the intermeeting period and had been instrumental in providing an effective floor under the federal funds rate and supporting other money market rates those rates remained stable over the period following the suspension of the debt ceiling in early june the treasury department issued securities notably treasury bills to replenish the treasury general account tga the resulting greater availability of treasury bills which were priced at rates slightly above the current and expected on rrp rates induced a net decline in on rrp balances for the period a further decline in on rrp balances was deemed probable amid sustained projected treasury bill issuance further reduc tions in the size of the federal reserves balance sheet in accordance with the previously announced plans for reducing the size of the federal reserves balance sheet and a possible further reduction in policy uncer tainty that could incentivize money funds to extend the duration of their portfolios in the july desk survey of primary dealers respondents expected lower on rrp balances and higher bank reserves by the end of the year compared with the june survey by unanimous vote the committee ratified the desks domestic transactions over the intermeeting period there were no intervention operations in foreign curren cies for the systems account during the intermeeting pe riod staff review of the economic situation the information available at the time of the july meeting suggested that real gross domestic product gdp rose at a moderate pace over the first half of the year the labor market remained very tight though the imbalance between demand and supply in the labor mar ket was gradually diminishing consumer price infla tionas measured by the month percent change in the price index for pceremained elevated in may and available information suggested that inflation declined but remained elevated in june in the second quarter total nonfarm payroll employ ment posted its slowest average monthly increase since the recovery began in mid though payroll gains re mained robust compared with those seen before the pandemic similarly the privatesector job openings rate as measured by the job openings and labor turn over survey fell in may to its lowest level since march but remained well above prepandemic levels the unemployment rate edged down to percent in june while the labor force participation rate and the employ menttopopulation ratio were both unchanged the unemployment rates for african americans and hispan ics however both rose and were well above the national average average hourly earnings rose percent over the months ending in june compared with a year earlier increase of percent consumer price inflation continued to show signs of easing but remained elevated total pce price inflation was percent over the months ending in

of month pce price inflation constructed by the federal reserve bank of dallas was percent in may in june the month change in the cpi was per cent while core cpi inflation was percent over the same period measures of shortterm inflation expecta tions had moved down alongside actual inflation but re mained above prepandemic levels in contrast measures of medium to longerterm inflation expecta tions were in the range seen in the decade before the pandemic available indicators suggested that real gdp rose in the second quarter at a pace similar to the one posted in the first quarter however private domestic final pur chaseswhich includes pce residential investment and business fixed investment and which often provides a better signal of underlying economic momentum than does gdpappeared to have decelerated in the second quarter manufacturing output rose in the second quar ter supported by a robust increase in motor vehicle pro duction after falling sharply in april real exports of goods picked up in may led by higher exports of industrial sup plies and automotive products real goods imports fell as lower imports of consumer goods and industrial sup plies more than offset higher imports of capital goods the nominal us international trade deficit narrowed as a sharp decline in nominal imports of goods and services outpaced a decline in exports the available data sug gested that net exports subtracted from us gdp growth in the second quarter indicators of economic activity such as purchasing man agers indexes pmis pointed to a stepdown in the pace of foreign growth in the second quarter reflecting fading of the impetus from chinas reopening continued ane mic growth in europe some weakening of activity in canada and mexico as well as weak external demand and the slump in the hightech industry weighing on many asian economies incoming data also indicated that global manufacturing activity remained weak during the intermeeting period foreign headline inflation continued to fall reflecting in part the passthrough of previous declines in commod ity prices to retail energy and food prices core inflation edged down in many countries but generally remained high in this context and amid tight labor market con ditions many afe central banks raised policy rates and underscored the need to raise rates further or hold them at sufficiently restrictive levels to bring inflation in their countries back to their targets in contrast central banks of emerging market economies largely remained on hold and some indicated that a rate cut is possible at their next meeting staff review of the financial situation over the intermeeting period market participants inter preted domestic economic data releases as indicating continued resilience of economic activity and some eas ing of inflationary pressures and they viewed monetary policy communications as pointing to somewhat more restrictive policy than expected the marketimplied path for the federal funds rate rose modestly and nom inal treasury yields increased somewhat at shorter ma turities meanwhile broad equity prices increased and spreads on investment and speculativegrade corporate bonds narrowed moderately financing conditions con tinued to be generally restrictive and borrowing costs remained elevated over the intermeeting period the marketimplied path for the federal funds rate

quotes ended the period modestly higher yields on treasury securities increased modestly at shorter matur ities but only a bit at longer maturities measures of in flation compensation rose only slightly for nearterm and longer maturities measures of uncertainty about the path of the policy rate derived from interest rate op tions remained very elevated by historical standards broad stock

mod estly on net over the intermeeting period as foreign cen tral banks continued to raise policy rates and signal the potential for further tightening increases in yields were tempered however by

partially reversing the surge at the onset of the bank turmoil in march credit availability for businesses appeared to tighten somewhat in recent months credit from capital mar kets was somewhat subdued but overall remained acces sible for larger corporations issuance of leveraged loans remained limited reflecting low levels of leveraged buy out and merger and acquisition activity as well as

categories tightened further in the second quarter and that banks expected to tighten cre stand ards further over the second half of the year meanwhile cmbs issuance picked up a bit in may and then ticked down in june after recording low volumes earlier in the year credit in the residential mortgage market remained broadly available for highcreditscore borrowers who met standard conforming loan criteria only modest net percentages of banks in the july sloos reported tightening standards for mortgage loans eligible to be purchased by governmentsponsored enterprises while a moderate net percentage of banks reported expecting to tighten lending standards further for these loans over the second half of the year meanwhile the availability of mortgage credit remained tighter for households with lower credit scores at levels close to those prevailing be fore the pandemic banks reported in the sloos that they had tightened standards for certain categories of residential real estate loans to be held on their balance sheets such as jumbo loans and home equity lines of credit in addition banks reported expecting to tighten standards for jumbo loans during the remainder of conditions remained generally accommodative in con sumer credit markets with credit available for most bor rowers credit card balances increased in the second quarter though at a somewhat slower pace than in pre vious months in the july sloos banks reported ex pecting to continue tightening lending standards for credit card loans overall the credit quality of most businesses and house holds remained solid while there were signs of deteri oration in credit quality in some sectors such as the of fice segment of cre delinquency rates generally re mained near their prepandemic lows the credit quality minutes of the meeting of july page of ci and cre loans on banks balance sheets re mained sound as of the end of the first quarter of however in the july sloos banks frequently cited concerns about the credit quality of both cre and other loans as reasons for expecting to tighten their lending standards over the remainder of the year aggregate de linquency rates on pools of commercial mortgages back ing cmbs increased in may and june the staff provided an update on its assessment of the stability of the financial system and on balance charac terized the financial vulnerabilities of the us financial system as notable the staff judged that asset valuation pressures remained notable in particular measures of valuations in both residential and commercial property markets remained high relative to fundamentals house prices while having cooled earlier this year started to rise again and pricetorent ratios remained at elevated levels and near those seen in the mids although commercial property prices moved down developments in the cre sector following the pandemic may have pro duced a permanent shift away from traditional working patterns if so fundamentals in the sector could decline notably and contribute to a deterioration in credit qual ity the staff assessed that vulnerabilities associated with household and nonfinancial business leverage remained moderate overall aggregate household debt growth re mained in line with income growth while nonfinancial businesses remained highly leveraged and thus vulnera ble to shocks firms debt growth has been relatively sub dued recently and their ability to service that debt has been quite high even among lowerrated firms lever age in the financial sector was characterized as notable in the banking sector regulatory riskbased capital ratios showed the system remained well capitalized however while the overall banking system retained ample loss bearing capacity some banks experienced sizable de clines in the fair value of their assets as a consequence of rising interest rates vulnerabilities associated with funding risks were also characterized as notable al though a small number of banks saw notable outflows of deposits late in the first quarter and early in the second quarter deposit flows later stabilized staff economic outlook the economic forecast prepared by the staff for the july fomc meeting was stronger than the june projection since the emergence of stress in the banking sector in midmarch indicators of spending and real activity had come in stronger than anticipated as a result the staff no longer judged that the economy would enter a mild recession toward the end of the year however the staff continued to expect that real gdp growth in and would run below their estimate of potential output growth leading to a small increase in the unemployment rate relative to its current level the staff continued to project that total and core pce price inflation would move lower in coming years much of the stepdown in core inflation was expected to occur over the second half of with forwardlooking indi cators pointing to a slowing in the rate of increase of housing services prices and with core nonhousing ser vices prices and core goods prices expected to decelerate over the remainder of inflation was anticipated to ease further over as demandsupply imbalances continued to resolve by total pce price inflation was expected to be percent and core inflation was expected to be percent the staff continued to judge that the risks to the baseline projection for real activity were tilted to the downside risks to the staffs baseline inflation forecast were seen as skewed to the upside given the possibility that infla tion dynamics would prove to be more persistent than expected or that further adverse shocks to supply condi tions might occur moreover the additional monetary policy tightening that would be necessitated by higher or more persistent inflation represented a downside risk to the projection for real activity participants views on current conditions and the economic outlook in their discussion of current economic conditions par ticipants noted that economic activity had been expand ing at a moderate pace job gains had been robust in recent months and the unemployment rate remained low inflation remained elevated participants agreed that the us banking system was sound and resilient they commented that tighter credit conditions for households and businesses were likely to weigh on eco nomic activity hiring and inflation however partici pants agreed that the extent of these effects remained uncertain against this background the committee re mained highly attentive to inflation risks in assessing the economic outlook participants noted that real gdp growth had continued to exhibit resilience in the first half of the year and that the economy had been showing considerable momentum a gradual slow down in economic activity nevertheless appeared to be in progress consistent with the restraint placed on de mand by the cumulative tightening of monetary policy since early last year and the associated effects on finan page federal open market committee cial conditions participants remarked on the uncer tainty about the lags in the effects of monetary policy on the economy and discussed the extent to which the ef fects on the economy stemming from the tightening that the committee had undertaken had already materialized participants commented that monetary policy tightening appeared to be working broadly as intended and that a continued gradual slowing in real gdp growth would help reduce demandsupply imbalances in the economy participants assessed that the ongoing tightening of credit conditions in the banking sector as evidenced in the most recent surveys of banks also would likely weigh on economic activity in coming quarters participants noted the recent reduction in total and core inflation rates however they stressed that inflation remained unacceptably high and that further evidence would be required for them to be confident that inflation was clearly on a path toward the committees percent ob jective participants continued to view a period of be lowtrend growth in real gdp and some softening in la bor market conditions as needed to bring aggregate sup ply and aggregate demand into better balance and reduce inflation pressures sufficiently to return inflation to percent over time participants noted that consumer spending had recently exhibited considerable resilience underpinned by in ag gregate strong household balance sheets robust job and income gains a low unemployment rate and rising con sumer confidence nevertheless tight financial condi tions primarily reflecting the cumulative effect of the committees shift to a restrictive policy stance were ex pected to contribute to slower growth in consumption in the period ahead participants cited other factors that were likely leading to or appeared consistent with a slowdown in consumption including the declining stock of excess savings softening labor market conditions and increased price sensitivity on the part of customers some participants observed that recent increases in home prices suggested that the housing sectors re sponse to monetary policy restraint may have peaked in their discussion of the business sector participants cited various improvements in firms cost structures these included betterfunctioning supply chains lower input costs and an increased ability to hire and retain workers participants also discussed conditions that could lead to higher economic activitysuch as leaner inventories and reduced expectations of a sharp eco nomic slowdownand factors that could lead to lower economic activitysuch as continuing economic uncer tainty the vulnerabilities of the cre market and the on going weakness of manufacturing output participants judged that over coming quarters firms would reduce the pace of their investment spending and hiring in re sponse to tight financial conditions and the slowing of economic activity participants remarked that the labor market continued to be very tight but pointed to signs that demand and supply were coming into better balance they noted ev idence that labor demand was easingincluding de clines in job openings lower quits rates more parttime work slower growth in hours worked higher unemploy ment insurance claims and more moderate rates of nominal wage growth in addition they remarked on indications of increasing labor supply including a fur ther rise in the primeage participation rate to a post pandemic high participants also observed however that although growth in payrolls had slowed recently it continued to exceed values consistent over time with an unchanged unemployment rate and that nominal wages were still rising at rates above levels assessed to be con sistent with the sustained achievement of the commit tees percent inflation objective participants judged that further progress toward a balancing of demand and supply in the labor market was needed and they ex pected that additional softening in labor market condi tions would take place over time participants cited a number of tentative signs that infla tion pressures could be abating these signs included some softening in core goods prices lower online prices evidence that firms were raising prices by smaller amounts than previously slower increases in shelter prices and recent declines in survey estimates of shorter term inflation expectations and of inflation uncertainty various participants discussed the continued stability of longerterm inflation expectations at levels consistent with percent inflation over time and the role that the committees policy tightening had played in delivering this outcome nonetheless several participants com mented that significant disinflationary pressures had yet to become apparent in the prices of core services exclud ing housing participants observed that notwithstanding recent fa vorable developments inflation remained well above the committees percent longerterm objective and that el evated inflation was continuing to harm businesses and householdslowincome families in particular partici pants stressed that the committee would need to see more data on inflation and further signs that aggregate demand and aggregate supply were moving into better balance to be confident that inflation pressures were minutes of the meeting of july page abating and that inflation was on course to return to percent over time participants generally noted a high degree of uncertainty regarding the cumulative effects on the economy of past monetary policy tightening participants cited upside risks to inflation including those associated with scenar ios in which recent supply chain improvements and fa vorable commodity price trends did not continue or in which aggregate demand failed to slow by an amount sufficient to restore price stability over time possibly leading to more persistent elevated inflation or an unan choring of inflation expectations in discussing down side risks to economic activity and inflation participants considered the possibility that the cumulative tightening of monetary policy could lead to a sharper slowdown in the economy than expected as well as the possibility that the effects of the tightening of bank credit conditions could prove more substantial than anticipated in their discussion of financial stability participants ob served that the banking system was sound and resilient and that banking stress had calmed in recent months participants also noted that the most recent stresstest results indicated that large banks appeared to be well po sitioned to withstand a severe recession various partic ipants commented on risks that could affect some banks including unrealized losses on assets resulting from ris ing interest rates significant reliance on uninsured de posits and increased funding costs participants also commented on risks associated with a potential sharp decline in cre valuations that could adversely affect some banks and other financial institutions such as in surance companies that are heavily exposed to cre several participants noted the susceptibility of some nonbank financial institutions such as money market funds or digital asset entities to runs or instability in addition several participants emphasized the need for banks to establish readiness to use federal reserve li quidity facilities and for the federal reserve to ensure its own readiness to provide liquidity during periods of stress in their consideration of appropriate monetary policy ac tions at this meeting participants concurred that eco nomic activity had been expanding at a moderate pace the labor market remained very tight with robust job gains in recent months and the unemployment rate still low but there were continuing signs that supply and de mand in the labor market were coming into better bal ance participants also noted that tighter credit condi tions facing households and businesses were a source of headwinds for the economy and would likely weigh on economic activity hiring and inflation however the extent of these effects remained uncertain although in flation had moderated since the middle of last year it remained well above the committees longerrun goal of percent and participants remained resolute in their commitment to bring inflation down to the committees percent objective amid these economic conditions almost all participants judged it appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate to to per cent at this meeting participants noted that this action would put the stance of monetary policy further into re strictive territory consistent with reducing demandsup ply imbalances in the economy and helping to restore price stability a couple of participants indicated that they favored leaving the target range for the federal funds rate unchanged or that they could have supported such a proposal they judged that maintaining the cur rent degree of restrictiveness at this time would likely re sult in further progress toward the committees goals while allowing the committee time to further evaluate this progress all participants agreed that it was appro priate to continue the process of reducing the federal reserves securities holdings as described in its previ ously announced plans for reducing the size of the fed eral reserves balance sheet a number of participants noted that balance sheet runoff need not end when the committee eventually begins to reduce the target range for the federal funds rate in discussing the policy outlook participants continued to judge that it was critical that the stance of monetary policy be sufficiently restrictive to return inflation to the committees percent objective over time they noted that uncertainty about the economic outlook remained elevated and agreed that policy decisions at future meet ings should depend on the totality of the incoming in formation and its implications for the economic outlook and inflation as well as for the balance of risks partici pants expected that the data arriving in coming months would help clarify the extent to which the disinflation process was continuing and product and labor markets were reaching a better balance between demand and sup ply this information would be valuable in determining the extent of additional policy firming that may be ap propriate to return inflation to percent over time par ticipants also emphasized the importance of communi cating as clearly as possible about the committees data dependent approach to policy and its firm commitment to bring inflation down to its percent objective participants discussed several riskmanagement consid erations that could bear on future policy decisions with inflation still well above the committees longerrun goal page federal open market committee and the labor market remaining tight most participants continued to see significant upside risks to inflation which could require further tightening of monetary pol icy some participants commented that even though economic activity had been resilient and the labor mar ket had remained strong there continued to be down side risks to economic activity and upside risks to the unemployment rate these included the possibility that the macroeconomic effects of the tightening in financial conditions since the beginning of last year could prove more substantial than anticipated a number of partici pants judged that with the stance of monetary policy in restrictive territory risks to the achievement of the com mittees goals had become more two sided and it was important that the committees decisions balance the risk of an inadvertent overtightening of policy against the cost of an insufficient tightening committee policy actions in their discussion of monetary policy for this meeting members agreed that economic activity had been ex panding at a moderate pace they also concurred that job gains had been robust in recent months and the un employment rate had remained low inflation had re mained elevated members concurred that the us banking system was sound and resilient they also agreed that tighter credit

division of monetary affairs board developments in financial markets and open market operations the manager turned first to a review of developments in financial markets over the intermeeting period us data releases generally pointed to greater economic resilience than previously thought and the reaction in market pric ing implied both a higher expected trajectory for the pol icy rate at longer horizons and higher term premiums policysensitive rates rose moderately and longerdated forward rates displayed larger increases tenyear treas ury yields ended the period more than basis points higher and broad measures of equity prices fell bank equity prices underperformed over the period but taking a somewhat longer view investor sentiment toward the page federal open market committee banking sector appeared to have largely stabilized with less differentiation of equity price movements across bank types the dollar broadly appreciated against ad vancedeconomy currencies over the period as stronger us data supported moderately increased yield differen tials against these economies amid perceptions that pol icy rates were at or near their peaks in china signs of strain in the property sector increased and optimism about growth diminished further on net although broader markets including global commodity markets did not appear to show elevated concern about china related risks us financial conditions tightened with higher longerterm rates lower equity prices and a stronger dollar contributing roughly equally to the in crease in various financial conditions indexes in addressing the increase in nominal yields on longer run treasury securities over the intermeeting period the manager noted that the rise in real yields exceeded that of nominal yields over the period implying a small de cline in inflation compensation inflation expectations appeared to remain very well anchored market partici pants cited various factors for the rise in longerterm nominal yields including strongerthanexpected eco nomic data a possible increase in the neutral policy rate greater economic and policy uncertainty and larger thanexpected borrowing by the treasury household and corporate borrowing rates increased over the period generally rising in line with treasury yields still market participants noted that with house hold and corporate borrowers having a limited need to refinance debt in the near term it could take more time for past monetary policy actions to fully pass through to these sectors regarding expectations for the september fomc meet ing the manager noted that responses to the open mar ket desks survey of primary dealers and survey of market participants and market pricing all pointed to a virtual certainty of no change in the policy rate in addi tion modal expectations for the policy rate from the sur veys were that the current target range would be main tained until the may fomc meeting compared with march in the previous survey with a roughly one inthree chance of a basis point increase by the no vember fomc meeting for horizons beyond the mid dle of next year the modal path from the surveys was notably lower than the marketimplied path the manager turned next to developments in money markets and desk operations usage of the overnight reverse repurchase agreement on rrp facility contin ued to decline over the intermeeting period largely re flecting reduced participation by government and prime money market funds even as these funds continued to see inflows increased supply of money market instru ments especially treasury bills contributed to a slight increase in money market rates which appeared to in duce money funds to shift away from on rrp toward other instruments however the on rrp facility con tinued to provide an effective floor for the federal funds rate with on rrp balances falling more than federal reserve assets reserve balances grew over the period at more than trillion reserves remained abundant in the september survey of primary dealers respond ents generally saw a lower path for on rrp participa tion and a higher path for reserves compared with the july survey by unanimous vote the committee ratified the desks domestic transactions over the intermeeting period there were no intervention operations in foreign curren cies for the systems account during the intermeeting pe riod staff review of the economic situation the data available at the time of the september meeting suggested that real gross domestic product gdp was rising at a solid pace in the third quarter the labor market continued to be tight with the unemploy ment rate low and job gains slowing but remaining strong consumer price inflation was still elevated the imbalance between labor demand and supply ap peared to be easing total nonfarm payroll employment increased at a slower pace over july and august than in the second quarter the privatesector job openings rate and the quits rate both measured by the job openings and labor turnover survey moved down further through july over july and august the unemployment rate edged up on net and stood at percent in august and both the labor force participation rate lfpr and the employmenttopopulation ratio rose slightly the unemployment rate for african americans declined while the jobless rate for hispanics rose and both rates were still above the national average the easing of labor market imbalances was also evident in the recent wage data with the month changes in average hourly earn ings and the employment cost index and the fourquar ter change in businesssector compensation per hour all lower than their yearearlier levels consumer price inflation remained elevated but contin ued to show signs of slowing the total price index for personal consumption expenditures pce increased percent over the months ending in july and core minutes of the meeting of september page pce price inflation which excludes changes in energy prices and many

over the same period and both total and core cpi inflation were well below their yearearlier lev els survey measures of consumers shortterm inflation expectations had moved down alongside actual inflation but remained above prepandemic levels in contrast survey measures of medium to longerterm inflation ex pectations remained in the range seen in the decade be fore the pandemic available

increased in july supported by higher exports of auto motive products real goods imports also rose as im ports of consumer goods and capital goods partially re covered from their declines in recent months the nom inal us international trade deficit widened as growth in imports of goods and services outpaced that of exports foreign economic growth slowed in the second quarter as troubles in the property sector weighed on economic activity in china and monetary policy restraint contrib uted to the slowing in economic growth in europe available data for the third quarter such as purchasing managers indexes and measures of business confidence pointed to a continued subdued pace of economic activ ity abroad foreign headline inflation continued to fall but remained elevated in several economies though energy prices turned up again in the context of stillhigh core infla tion some central banks in advanced foreign economies afes raised their policy rates despite a slowdown in economic activity and indicated their intention to hold these rates at sufficiently restrictive levels to bring infla tion back to target rates in contrast central banks of emerging market economies largely remained on hold and some even began to cut rates amid easing inflation ary pressures staff review of the financial situation over the intermeeting period generally robust eco nomic data led to moderate increases in the market implied path of the federal funds rate and yields on shorterterm treasury securities yields on medium and longerterm nominal treasury securities rose more substantially mainly reflecting higher term premiums and higher real yields stock prices declined somewhat but spreads on investment and speculativegrade cor porate bonds were little changed financing conditions tightened somewhat and borrowing costs increased moderately market participants pointed to a range of factors that may have contributed to the increase in longerterm for ward rates including higher term premiums and upward revisions to market views of the likely path of treasury debt over time real yields increased almost as much as or a little more than nominal yields leaving implied measures of inflation compensation modestly changed the marketimplied path for the federal funds rate in the near term was up slightly since the july fomc meeting and the expected path further

foreign data suggested slowing economic growth abroad longterm yields in afes ended the period higher reflecting spillovers from higher us yields and to a lesser extent the increase in japanese yields follow ing the decision by the bank of japan to effectively widen its target range for the year japanese yield global equity prices declined moderately reflecting higher longterm yields and increased concerns about the foreign economic outlook bond and equity funds focused on emerging markets saw moderate outflows page federal open market committee in domestic credit markets borrowing rates for busi nesses households and municipalities increased moder ately over the intermeeting period mostly reflecting a passthrough of higher yields on longermaturity treas ury securities to those borrowing rates interest rates on newly originated bank loans to businesses and house holds increased over the second quarter interest rates on credit card offers increased in july and interest rates on auto loans increased in july and august bank credit conditions appeared to tighten somewhat over the intermeeting period but credit to businesses and households remained generally accessible com mercial and industrial loan balances contracted but out standing commercial real estate cre loans increased from july through late august though at a slower pace than earlier in the year within the category of cre loans nonfarm nonresidential loans contracted over the summer for the first time since march bank fund ing conditions were generally stable core deposits de clined but were offset by inflows of large time deposits credit was available for most consumers credit card balances grew in the second quarter through late august for residential real estate borrowers credit availability was little changed credit conditions for small busi nesses were also fairly stable the paynet small busi ness lending index indicated that loan originations edged up in july and stood above the median of its pre pandemic level credit was generally accessible through capital markets although issuance was subdued issu ance of nonfinancial investment and speculativegrade bonds was muted in july but picked up modestly in au gust and issuance of municipal bonds was weak in july new issuance of leveraged loans was subdued in july and issuance of agency and nonagency commercial mortgagebacked securities cmbs was soft in july and august credit quality deteriorated a little further across many sectors in recent months but remained broadly solid in the cre sector delinquency rates on nonfarm nonresi dential cre bank loans rose over the second quarter while delinquency rates on construction land develop ment and multifamily loans were roughly unchanged delinquency rates of loans in cmbs pools increased driven by the office and retail sectors the office delin quency rate rose more than percentage points since january but remained below its prepandemic average the delinquency rate for small business loans ticked up in june and july delinquency rates for credit cards and auto loans increased further in the second quarter and stood a bit above their average levels in the years leading up to the pandemic the fraction of potential borrowers with a prime credit score expanded through the second quarter moving further above its prepandemic level the trailing default rates for investment and specula tivegrade corporate bonds increased in july but re mained at historically low levels the trailing default rate for leveraged loans was little changed on net but down grades of leveraged loans surpassed upgrades in july and august in contrast to many other types of loans the payment performance of home mortgages improved delin quency rates of federal housing administration and department of veterans affairs loans in july were lower than levels seen earlier this year and delinquency rates of conventional loans remained at historical lows credit quality was also strong for municipal borrowers staff economic outlook the economic forecast prepared by the staff for the sep tember fomc meeting was stronger than the july pro jection as consumer and business spending appeared to be more resilient to tight financial conditions than pre viously expected the staff assumed that gdp growth for the rest of this year would be damped a bit by the autoworkers strike with these effects unwound by a small boost to gdp growth next year the size and tim ing of these effects were highly uncertain in all the staff projected that real gdp growth in through would be slower on average than this year and would run below the staffs estimate of potential output growth restrained over the next couple of years by the lagged effects of monetary policy actions the unem ployment rate was projected to remain roughly flat through as upward pressure from belowpotential output growth was offset by downward pressure from further improvements in labor market functioning total and core pce price inflation were forecast to be around percent at the end of this year and inflation was projected to move lower in coming years as demand and supply in product and labor markets continued to move into better alignment total and core pce price inflation were expected to be close to percent in the staff continued to view the uncertainty around the baseline projection as considerable risks around the in flation forecast were seen as skewed to the upside given the possibility that inflation could prove to be more per sistent than expected or that further adverse shocks to supply conditions might occur should these upside in flation risks materialize the response of monetary policy could if coupled with an adverse reaction in financial minutes of the meeting of september page markets tilt the risks around the forecast for economic activity to the downside participants views on current conditions and the economic outlook in conjunction with this fomc meeting participants submitted their projections of the most likely outcomes for real gdp growth the unemployment rate and infla tion for each year from through and over the longer run the projections were based on their individ ual assessments of appropriate monetary policy includ ing the path of the federal funds rate the longerrun projections represented each participants assessment of the rate to which each variable would be expected to converge over time under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy a summary of economic projections sep was released to the public following the conclusion of the meeting regarding the economic outlook participants assessed that real gdp had been expanding at a solid pace and had been more resilient than expected nevertheless participants also noted that they expected that real gdp growth would slow in the near term participants judged that the current stance of monetary policy was restrictive and that it broadly appeared to be restraining the econ omy as intended participants stressed that current in flation remained unacceptably high while acknowledging that it had moderated somewhat over the past year they also noted that further evidence would be required for them to be confident that inflation was clearly on a path to the committees percent objective partici pants continued to view a period of belowtrend growth in real gdp and some softening in labor market condi tions as likely to be needed to bring aggregate demand and aggregate supply into better balance and reduce in flation pressures sufficiently to return inflation to per cent over time in their discussion of the household sector participants observed that aggregate consumer spending had contin ued to exhibit considerable strength supported by the strong labor market and by generally strong household balance sheets however many participants remarked that the finances of some households were coming un der pressure amid high inflation and declining savings and that there had been an increasing reliance on credit to finance expenditures in addition tighter credit con ditions waning fiscal support for families and a resump tion of student loan payments were viewed by several participants as having the potential to weigh on the growth of consumption while household credit quality was seen as generally strong a few participants noted ris ing delinquency rates on some types of consumer credit a couple of participants also remarked that households were becoming increasingly price sensitive some par ticipants noted that housing demand was resilient de spite higher interest rates new home construction was solid in part reflecting the limited inventory of homes available for sale regarding the business sector participants noted that activity continued to be solid though several pointed to signs of softening conditions many participants noted improved business conditions from an increased ability to hire and retain workers betterfunctioning supply chains or reduced input cost pressures a few partici pants commented that their business contacts had re ported difficulties passing on cost increases to custom ers several participants judged that over coming quar ters business activity would be restrained by tighter fi nancial conditions such as higher interest rates and more constrained access to bank credit several partici pants noted however that the tightening of credit con ditions resulting from the banking stresses earlier in the year was likely to be less severe than they previously ex pected a number of participants expressed concerns about vulnerabilities in the cre sector many partici pants commented that they expected that the autowork ers strike would in the near term result in a slowdown in production of motor vehicles and parts and possibly put upward pressure on automobile prices but that these effects would be temporary with respect to the agricul tural sector a few participants noted that conditions were mixed as crop prices had declined amid higher pro duction estimates and as supply and demand imbalances pushed up the prices of some types of livestock and held down the prices of others participants observed that the labor market was tight but that supply and demand conditions were continuing to come into better balance most participants remarked that a range of indicators of labor demand were easing as could be seen by declines in job openings a narrowing of the jobstoworkers gap lower quits rates and a re duction in average weekly hours worked to levels at or below those seen before the pandemic however sev eral participants noted that labor markets remained very tight in some sectors of the economy such as health care services and education many participants also ob served that measures of labor supply especially the lfpr had moved up some participants commented that the increase in the lfpr for women had been par ticularly notable although they expressed concern that challenges regarding the availability of childcare could page federal open market committee affect the sustainability of this increase in participation several participants noted that immigration had also been boosting labor supply some participants observed that payroll growth remained strong but had slowed in recent months to a pace closer to that consistent with maintaining a constant unemployment rate over time most participants commented that the pace of nominal wage increases had moderated and a few also mentioned that the wage premium for job switchers had come down they noted however that nominal wages were still rising at rates above levels generally assessed to be consistent with the sustained achievement of the com mittees percent inflation objective given current esti mates of trend productivity growth participants noted that the data received over the past several months generally suggested that inflation was slowing even with these favorable developments they emphasized that further progress was needed to get in flation sustainably to percent participants pointed to the softening of price inflation for goods amid improv ing supply conditions and to declining housing services inflation several participants remarked that despite the recent rise in energy prices food and energy prices over the past year had contributed to a decline in overall in flation however participants also noted that significant progress in reducing inflation had yet to become appar ent in the prices of core services excluding housing par ticipants noted that longerterm inflation expectations remained well anchored and that shorterterm inflation expectations had been moving down from elevated lev els participants observed that notwithstanding recent favorable developments inflation remained well above the committees percent longerrun objective and that elevated inflation was continuing to harm businesses and householdsparticularly lowincome households par ticipants stressed that they would need to see more data indicating that inflation pressures were abating to be more confident that inflation was on course to return to percent over time participants generally noted there was still a high degree of uncertainty surrounding the economic outlook one new source of uncertainty was that associated with the autoworkers strike and many participants observed that an intensification of the strike posed both an upside risk to inflation and a downside risk to activity a majority of participants pointed to upside risks to inflation from rising energy prices that could undo some of the recent disinflation or to the risk that inflation would prove more persistent than expected various participants noted downside risks to economic activity including that credit conditions might tighten more than expected if the domestic banking sector experienced further strains the possibility that the economic slowdown in china could result in a drag on global economic growth or that an extended us government shutdown could have negative albeit temporary consequences for growth some participants remarked that an upside risk to their projections for economic activity was that the unexpected resilience that the economy had demon strated so far could persist several participants com mented that a government shutdown might result in the delayed release of some economic data and that this out come would make it more difficult to assess economic conditions a few participants observed that there were challenges in assessing the state of the economy because some data continued to be volatile and subject to large revisions in their consideration of appropriate monetary policy ac tions at this meeting participants concurred that eco nomic activity had been expanding at a solid pace and had been resilient while the labor market remained tight job gains had slowed and there were continuing signs that supply and demand in the labor market were coming into better balance participants also noted that tighter credit conditions facing households and busi nesses were a source of headwinds for the economy and would likely weigh on economic activity hiring and in flation however the extent of these effects remained uncertain although inflation had moderated since the middle of last year it remained well above the commit tees longerrun goal of percent and participants re mained resolute in their commitment to bring inflation down to the committees percent objective amid these economic conditions and in consideration of the significant cumulative tightening in the stance of mone tary policy and the lags with which policy affects eco nomic activity and inflation almost all participants judged it appropriate to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at to percent at this meeting participants judged that maintaining this restrictive stance of policy would support further progress toward the committees goals while allowing the committee time to gather additional data to evaluate this progress all participants agreed that it was appropriate to con tinue the process of reducing the federal reserves se curities holdings as described in its previously an nounced plans for reducing the size of the federal re serves balance sheet in discussing the policy outlook participants continued to judge that it was critical that the stance of monetary policy be kept sufficiently restrictive to return inflation minutes of the meeting of september page to the committees percent objective over time a ma jority of participants judged that one more increase in the target federal funds rate at a future meeting would likely be appropriate while some judged it likely that no further increases would be warranted all participants agreed that the committee was in a position to proceed carefully and that policy decisions at every meeting would continue to be based on the totality of incoming information and its implications for the economic out look as well as the balance of risks participants expected that the data arriving in coming months would help clar ify the extent to which the disinflation process was con tinuing and labor markets were reaching a better balance between demand and supply this information would be valuable in determining the extent of additional policy firming that may be appropriate to return inflation to percent over time some participants also emphasized the importance of continuing to communicate clearly to the public about the committees datadependent ap proach to policy and its firm commitment to bring infla tion down to percent all participants agreed that policy should remain restric tive for some time until the committee is confident that inflation is moving down sustainably toward its objec tive a few participants noted that the pace at which inflation was returning to the committees percent goal would influence their views of the sufficiently re strictive level of the policy rate and how long to keep policy restrictive several participants commented that with the policy rate likely at or near its peak the focus of monetary policy decisions and communications should shift from how high to raise the policy rate to how long to hold the policy rate at restrictive levels a few partic ipants noted that it would be important to monitor the real federal funds rate in gauging the stance of monetary policy over time most participants observed that postmeeting communications including the sep would help clarify to the public how participants assessed the likely evolution of the stance of monetary policy par ticipants observed that the continuing process of reduc ing the size of the federal reserves balance sheet was an important part of the overall approach to achieving their macroeconomic objectives several participants noted that the process of balance sheet runoff could continue for some time even after the committee be gins to reduce the target range for the federal funds rate a vast majority of participants continued to judge the future path of the economy as highly uncertain many noted data volatility and potential data revisions or the difficulty of estimating the neutral policy rate as sup porting the case for proceeding carefully in determining the extent of additional policy firming that may be ap propriate participants discussed several riskmanagement consid erations that could bear on future policy decisions par ticipants generally judged that with the stance of mone tary policy in restrictive territory risks to the achieve ment of the committees goals had become more two sided but with inflation still well above the committees longerrun goal and the labor market remaining tight most participants continued to see upside risks to infla tion these risks included the imbalance of aggregate demand and supply persisting longer than expected as well as risks emanating from global oil markets the po tential for upside shocks to food prices the effects of a strong housing market on shelter inflation and the po tential for more limited declines in goods prices many participants commented that even though economic ac tivity had been resilient and the labor market had re mained strong there continued to be downside risks to economic activity and upside risks to the unemployment rate such risks included largerthananticipated lagged macroeconomic effects from the tightening in financial conditions the effect of labor union strikes slowing global growth and continued weakness in the cre sec tor participants generally noted that it was important to balance the risk of overtightening against the risk of in sufficient tightening committee policy actions in their discussion of monetary policy for this meeting members agreed that economic activity had been ex panding at a solid pace and accordingly that the corre sponding language in the postmeeting statement should be changed from moderate to solid they also con curred that job gains had slowed in recent months but remained strong and the unemployment rate had re mained low inflation had remained elevated members concurred that the us banking system was sound and resilient they also agreed that tighter credit conditions for households and businesses were likely to weigh on economic activity hiring and inflation but that the extent of these effects was uncertain members also concurred that they remained highly attentive to infla tion risks in support of the committees

economic activity and inflation and economic and financial developments in addition members agreed to continue to reduce the federal reserves holdings of treasury securities and agency debt and

in assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy they would continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook they would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the committees goals mem bers also agreed that their assessments will take into ac count a wide range of information

board andrei zlate group manager division of monetary affairs board developments in financial markets and open market operations the manager turned first to a review of developments in financial markets over the intermeeting period finan cial conditions continued to tighten driven by higher page federal open market committee yields on treasury securities as well as by lower equity prices and a stronger dollar which themselves partly re flected higher interest rates because earnings expecta tions had held up well in recent months the effect of higher interest rates on equity prices likely took place largely through valuations the rise since july in yields on longerdated nominal treasury securities was mostly attributable to increases in real yields there were small increases in inflation compensation but the levels of spot and forward rates were within historical ranges the manager also noted that survey measures pointed to generally stable inflation expectations especially at longer horizons and that in flation expectations remained well anchored staff analysis and responses from the open market desks survey of primary dealers and survey of market participants suggested that the bulk of the increase since july in the year nominal treasury yield could be at tributed to a higher term premium though higher policy expectations at longer horizons could also have played a role the manager also noted that liquidity conditions in the treasury market had not changed materially since july suggesting that treasury market liquidity had not been an important driver of the increase in yields the manager turned next to expectations for monetary policy both market pricing and responses to the desks surveys implied that market participants expected that the federal funds rate was at or near its peak and would be held there at least until the june fomc meeting there was a roughly percent probability of a basis point increase at either the december or january fomc meeting regarding balance sheet policy the surveys showed that respondents had pushed out the date they expected balance sheet runoff to stop perhaps partly in response to policymakers communications that balance sheet runoff could continue even after the committee begins to reduce the target range for the federal funds rate the manager then turned to developments in money markets and desk operations balance sheet runoff con tinued to proceed smoothly over the intermeeting period through reduced holdings of treasury securities agency debt and agency mortgagebacked securities the con tinued repayment by the federal deposit insurance cor poration of discount window loans extended to banks that were placed into receivership also contributed to re duced federal reserve assets on the liabilities side of the balance sheet usage of the overnight reverse repur chase agreement on rrp facility declined further as money market mutual funds continued to absorb new treasury bill issuance and appeared to increase invest ment in the private market for repurchase agreements repos as well overall the reduced usage of the on rrp facility released more reserves than the reduc tion in federal reserve assets and the increase in the treasury general account absorbed on net reserves expanded over the period and available indicators pointed to them remaining abundant primary dealers indicated that reserves were projected to remain within their recent range for the next several quarters the manager also noted that banks in addition to all pri mary dealers were already counterparties to the standing repo facility srf and that several more were in the onboarding process together these banks held the vast majority of srfeligible securities in the banking system the srf in addition to the discount window may there fore prove helpful for supplying liquidity to the banking system should funding pressures emerge by unanimous vote the committee ratified the desks domestic transactions over the intermeeting period there were no intervention operations in foreign curren cies for the systems account during the intermeeting pe riod staff review of the economic situation the data available at the time of the october no vember meeting indicated that us real gross domestic product gdp had expanded at a strong pace in the third quarter labor market conditions remained tight with continued strong job gains and a low unemploy ment rate consumer price inflation remained elevated labor demand and supply were slowly moving into bet ter alignment easing labor market imbalances were ap parent in the wage data with the month changes in average hourly earnings and the employment cost index each below their yearearlier levels although total non farm payroll employment rose at a faster pace in sep tember than in previous months the unemployment rate was unchanged at percent the labor force participa tion rate and the employmenttopopulation ratio were also unchanged in september the unemployment rate for african americans rose while the jobless rate for hispanics declined both rates were higher than the na tional average consumer price inflation remained elevated but contin ued to show signs of slowing the price index for total personal consumption expenditures pce increased percent over the months ending in september while core pce price inflation which excludes changes in energy prices and many consumer food prices was percent over the same period both total and core minutes of the meeting of october november page pce price inflation were well below their yearearlier levels the trimmed mean measure of month pce price inflation constructed by the federal reserve bank of dallas was percent in september also down from the level posted a year ago survey measures of consum ers shortrun inflation expectations remained above their prepandemic levels in contrast survey measures of medium to longerterm inflation expectations re mained in the range seen in the decade before the pan demic according to the advance estimate real gdp posted a strong gain in the third quarter private domestic final purchases which includes pce and private fixed invest ment and often provides a better signal than gdp of underlying economic momentum posted a smaller but stillsolid increase real exports and imports of goods and services grew at a robust pace in the third quarter after falling sharply in the second quarter reflecting broadbased strength across categories net exports made a slightly negative contribution to us gdp growth in the third quarter while the nominal trade deficit narrowed somewhat foreign economic growth remained subdued in the third quarter monetary policy restraint weighed on activity abroad especially in europe where euroarea gdp growth registered a small decline and the latest euro pean central bank lending survey pointed to a contrac tion in credit from a year ago although gdp growth in china improved in the third quarter supported by an increase in industrial production chinese retail sales continued to be held back by low consumer confidence and weakness in the residential property sector inflation abroad remained elevated while core inflation continued to ease amid slowing aggregate demand en ergy price inflation increased in many foreign econo mies with inflation still high most major foreign cen tral banks while keeping their policy rates unchanged indicated their intentions to hold these rates at suffi ciently restrictive levels to bring inflation back to target rates staff review of the financial situation over the intermeeting period longerterm treasury yields rose notably while shorterterm yields were little changed and the marketimplied path for the federal funds rate through declined slightly the increase in longerterm treasury yields appeared to be mostly at tributable to higher term premiums as strongerthanex pected economic data seemed to increase the uncertainty regarding how long policy rates might need to remain high meanwhile equity prices decreased and spreads on investment and speculativegrade corporate bonds widened financing conditions tightened further and borrowing costs continued to rise the marketimplied path for the federal funds rate through declined slightly over the intermeeting pe riod beyond the policy rate path implied by over night index swap quotes increased likely reflecting in part higher term premiums the rise in longerterm nominal treasury yields was driven by real yields short term inflation compensation fluctuated notably over the intermeeting period largely following the changes in en ergy prices but ended the period modestly lower broad stock price indexes declined over the intermeeting period equity prices in interest ratesensitive sectors such as real estate and utilities underperformed the broader market stock prices of banks also declined more than broader equity indexes the onemonth op tionimplied volatility on the sp index increased notably over the intermeeting period but remained be low the peaks observed in the first quarter of over the intermeeting period foreign asset prices were largely driven by spillovers from the rise in longerterm us treasury yields longerterm sovereign bond yields for advanced foreign economies rose foreign equity prices declined foreign credit spreads generally widened and investors continued to withdraw from emerging market economy funds strongerthanexpected us data on economic activity and widening interest rate dif ferentials between the us and the rest of the world con tributed to an increase in the staffs broad dollar index the bank of japan increased the flexibility of its yield curve control framework which contributed to the rise in longerterm japanese government bond yields the armed conflict between israel and hamas left a limited net imprint on foreign financial markets over this period conditions in shortterm funding markets remained sta ble over the intermeeting period takeup in the on rrp facility continued to decline over the period that decline primarily reflected money market funds re ducing their usage of the facility and increasing their holdings of treasury bills and private market repos in response to slightly more attractive rates on these alter native investments banks total deposit levels were roughly unchanged over the intermeeting period as out flows of core deposits were about offset by inflows of large time deposits which tend to be more expensive sources of funding wholesale borrowing by large banks increased over the intermeeting period page federal open market committee in domestic credit markets borrowing costs for busi nesses households and municipalities continued to rise from already elevated levels over the intermeeting pe riod primarily reflecting increases in longerterm treas ury yields interest rates on commercial and industrial ci loans and small business loans increased as did rates on loans to households including for year con forming residential mortgages new auto loans and credit cards rates also moved up on a broad array of fixedincome securities including residential and com mercial mortgagebacked securities municipal bonds and corporate bonds yields on corporate bonds rose more than treasury yields particularly for speculative grade bonds credit continued to be generally available to businesses households and municipalities total core loans on banks books continued to increase in the third quarter although at a slower pace than earlier in the year how ever smaller firms were finding it harder to obtain credit with the share of small firms reporting in september that it was more difficult to obtain credit compared with three months earlier rising from an already elevated level capital market financing continued to be available al though issuance in most markets was below typical lev els in the october senior loan officer opinion survey on bank lending practices sloos banks reported tight ening standards and terms on ci loans to firms of all sizes in the third quarter the most frequently cited rea sons for tightening ci standards and terms included concerns about the economic outlook a less favorable or more uncertain economic outlook and the effects of potential legislative changes supervisory actions or changes in accounting standards banks also reported that demand for ci loans weakened in the third quar ter with the most frequently cited reasons being de creased investment in plant or equipment and decreased inventory financing needs similarly banks indicated that commercial real estate cre loan standards contin ued to tighten and demand weakened further in the third quarter credit in the residential mortgage market remained easily available for highcreditscore borrowers who met standard conforming loan criteria however in the oc tober sloos banks reported tighter standards and weaker demand for almost all categories of residential real estate loans in the third quarter consumer credit remained readily available for most borrowers although there were signs of tightening standards credit card balances grew at a strong pace in august while auto credit continued to grow at a modest pace however respondents to the october sloos re ported tighter standards for all consumer loan categories in the third quarter meanwhile outstanding student loan balances declined significantly in august driven by the cancellation of student loan debt for certain borrow ers the credit quality of businesses households and munic ipalities continued to show signs of deterioration in most sectors as delinquency rates rose the credit quality of nonfinancial firms borrowing in the corporate bond market remained sound overall albeit with pockets of deterioration the credit quality of ci and cre loans on banks balance sheets remained generally stable through august however delinquency rates for non farm nonresidential cre loans recently picked up in the october sloos banks frequently cited concerns about credit quality including for both ci and cre loans as reasons for tightening standards over the third quarter the staff provided an update on its assessment of the stability of the financial system and on balance judged that the financial vulnerabilities of the us financial sys tem were notable the staff characterized asset valua tion pressures as notable in particular the staff noted that valuations in equities housing and cre were high the forward pricetoearnings ratio for sp firms increased to the upper quartile of its historical distribu tion house prices increased to the upper end of their historical range relative to fundamentals despite tight credit conditions in the mortgage market while cre prices declined valuations remained stretched with cap italization rates remaining near historical lows funda mentals in the office sector remained weak given the shift toward telework in many industries especially for central business districts and coastal cities delinquency rates on commercial mortgagebacked securities moved up as office and retail loan performance deteriorated vulnerabilities associated with business and household debt were characterized as moderate leverage in the financial sector was characterized as no table in the banking sector holdings of liquid assets remained high and regulatory riskbased capital ratios indicated ample lossbearing capacity in the banking sys tem however the fair value of banks longerterm fixedrate assets including loans decreased in the third quarter as longerterm interest rates rose hedge fund leverage remained above historical averages particularly for the largest funds funding risks were also character ized as notable reliance on uninsured deposits declined minutes of the meeting of october november page in the aggregate but remained high for some banks and shortterm nondeposit funding had increased staff economic outlook the economic forecast prepared by the staff for the oc tobernovember meeting was similar to the september projection the staff expected fourthquarter gdp growth to slow markedly from its thirdquarter rate all told however average gdp growth over the second half of the year was projected to be a little faster than the first halfs pace the staff also expected output in the fourth quarter to be temporarily restrained by the auto workers strike before being boosted in the first quarter as lost production begins to be made up the size and timing of these effects were highly uncertain however with the lagged effects of monetary policy actions ex pected to restrain activity real gdp was projected to rise more slowly than the staffs estimate of potential over the next two years before rising in line with potential in the unemployment rate was expected to be roughly flat through as the effects of belowpoten tial output growth were offset by the effects of further improvements in labor market functioning total pce price inflation was expected to be close to percent by the end of this year and core pce infla tion was expected to be around percent inflation was projected to move lower in coming years as demand and supply in product and labor markets moved into better alignment in total and core pce price in flation rates were expected to be close to percent the staff continued to view the uncertainty around the baseline projection as elevated risks around the infla tion forecast were seen as skewed to the upside given the possibility that inflation might prove to be more per sistent than expected or that additional adverse shocks to supply conditions might occur the risks to the fore cast for real activity were viewed to be skewed to the downside moreover the additional monetary policy tightening that would be necessitated by higher or more persistent inflation and the potential for a greater tight ening of financial conditions represented a downside risk to the projection for real activity participants views on current conditions and the economic outlook participants noted that real gdp had expanded at an un expectedly strong pace in the third quarter boosted by a surge in consumer spending nevertheless participants judged that aggregate demand and aggregate supply con tinued to come into better balance as a result of the cur rent restrictive stance of monetary policy and the con tinued normalization of aggregate supply conditions participants assessed that while labor market conditions remained tight they had eased since earlier in the year partly as a result of recent increases in labor supply par ticipants judged that the current stance of monetary pol icy was restrictive and was putting downward pressure on economic activity and inflation in addition they noted that financial conditions had tightened signifi cantly in recent months participants noted that inflation had moderated over the past year but stressed that cur rent inflation remained unacceptably high and well above the committees longerrun goal of percent they also stressed that further evidence would be re quired for them to be confident that inflation was clearly on a path to the committees percent objective par ticipants continued to view a period of belowpotential growth in real gdp and some further softening in labor market conditions as likely to be needed to reduce infla tion pressures sufficiently to return inflation to percent over time in their discussion of the household sector participants observed that the incoming data on consumer spending had again surprised to the upside likely supported by a strong labor market and by generally solid household balance sheets nevertheless some participants re marked that the finances of some householdsespe cially those in the low and moderateincome catego rieswere increasingly coming under pressure amid high prices for food and other essentials as well as tight credit conditions several participants added that delin quencies on auto loans and credit cards had risen for these households some participants commented that their district contacts reported a somewhat weaker pic ture of consumer demand than indicated by the incom ing aggregate data several participants however noted that repeated upside surprises in the aggregate spending data could indicate that considerable momentum could be sustained a couple of these participants commented that the aggregate household sector may have more fi nancial resources than previously thought which could help account for the strength in spending a few partic ipants observed that activity in the housing sector had flattened out in recent months likely reflecting the ef fects of further increases in mortgage rates from already elevated levels business fixed investment was flat in the third quarter and participants observed that conditions reported by their business contacts varied across industries and dis tricts some participants noted that businesses were benefiting from an increased ability to hire and retain workers betterfunctioning supply chains or reduced input cost pressures a few participants commented page federal open market committee that their business contacts had reported that cost in creases could not be easily passed on to customers sev eral participants commented that the apparent resolu tion of the united auto workers strike would reduce businesssector uncertainty several participants noted that an increasing number of district businesses were re porting that higher interest rates were affecting their businesses or that firms were increasingly cutting or de laying their investment plans because of higher borrow ing costs and tighter bank lending conditions a few participants noted that the tighter financial and credit conditions could be particularly challenging for small businesses a few participants observed that higher in terest rates were also affecting the agricultural sector with their contacts noting that high financing costs were likely weighing on purchases of heavy agricultural equip ment regarding the energy sector a few participants observed that energy markets had calmed after signifi cant volatility at the start of the current armed conflict between israel and hamas participants observed that the labor market remained tight payroll growth was unexpectedly strong in sep tember and the unemployment rate remained low nev ertheless participants assessed that labor supply and la bor demand were continuing to come into better bal ance measures of labor supply had moved up with the labor force participation rate for primeage workers ris ing this year especially for women and immigration also boosting labor supply a few participants expressed concern that the recent pace of increases in labor supply might not be sustainable in light of challenges regarding the availability of childcare and the uncertainty regarding the extent to which immigration would continue to boost the growth of labor supply regarding labor de mand various measures appeared to indicate some eas ing including a downward trend in job openings a lower quits rate and reduced wage premiums offered to job switchers consistent with the gradual rebalancing of la bor market conditions participants commented that the pace of nominal wage increases had continued to mod erate a few participants noted however that nominal wages were still rising at rates above levels generally as sessed to be consistent with the sustained achievement of the committees percent inflation objective given current estimates of trend productivity growth participants observed that inflation had continued to moderate since the middle of last year both the and month change measures of core pce price inflation had come down somewhat in recent months despite a less favorable monthly reading in september partici pants pointed to the softening of core goods prices in recent months as well as the continued gradual decline in housing services inflation however participants also noted that there had been only limited progress in bring ing down inflation in core services excluding housing participants noted that longerterm inflation expecta tions remained well anchored participants observed that notwithstanding the moderation of inflation so far inflation remained well above the committees percent longerrun objective and that elevated inflation was con tinuing to harm businesses and households particularly lowincome households participants stressed that they would need to see more data indicating that inflation pressures were abating to be more confident that infla tion was on course to return to percent over time participants noted that in recent months financial con ditions had tightened significantly because of a substan tial runup in longerterm treasury yields among other factors higher treasury yields contributed to an in crease in year mortgage rates to levels not seen in many years and led to higher corporate borrowing rates many participants observed that a range of measures suggested that the rise in longerterm yields had been driven primarily or substantially by a rise in the term pre miums on treasury securities participants generally viewed factors such as a fiscal outlook that suggested greater future supply of treasury securities than previ ously thought and increased uncertainty about the eco nomic and policy outlooks as likely having contributed to the rise in the term premiums some participants noted that the rise in longerterm yields may also have been driven by expectations for a higher path of the fed eral funds rate in light of the surprising resilience of the economy or a possible rise in the neutral policy rate par ticipants highlighted that longerterm yields could be volatile and that the factors behind the recent increase as well as their persistence were uncertain however they also noted that whatever the source of the rise in longerterm yields persistent changes in financial condi tions could have implications for the path of monetary policy and that it would therefore be important to con tinue to monitor market developments closely participants generally noted a high degree of uncertainty surrounding the economic outlook as upside risks to economic activity participants noted that the factors be hind the resilience in spending could persist longer than expected as downside risks participants cited the pos sibility that the effects on households and businesses of the cumulative policy tightening and tighter financial conditions could be larger than expected disruptions from a potential government shutdown and the possi bility that the resumption of student loan repayments minutes of the meeting of october november page could weigh on household spending by more than was expected as upside risks to inflation participants cited the possibility that progress on disinflation stalls or in flation reaccelerates because of continued momentum in economic activity a potential for a broadening of the armed conflict in the middle east was seen as presenting upside risk to inflation through its potential effect on oil prices as well as downside risk to economic activity in their discussion of financial stability participants ob served that the banking system was sound and resilient and that banking stresses had subsided however many participants commented that unrealized losses on assets resulting from the rise in longerterm interest rates sig nificant reliance by some banks on uninsured deposits and increased funding costs at banks warranted moni toring many participants also commented on risks as sociated with a potential sharp decline in cre valua tions which could adversely affect some banks and other financial institutions several participants noted potential cyber risks and emphasized the importance of firms particularly providers of critical infrastructure be ing prepared to recover from such threats a few par ticipants also discussed the importance of monitoring treasury market functioning and potential vulnerabili ties posed by the amount of leverage being used by hedge funds in this market in addition several partici pants emphasized the need for banks to establish readi ness to use federal reserve liquidity facilities and for the federal reserve to ensure its own readiness to provide liquidity during periods of stress in their consideration of appropriate monetary policy ac tions at this meeting participants noted that economic activity expanded at a strong pace in the third quarter and had been resilient while the labor market remained tight job gains had moderated on balance since earlier in the year and there were continuing signs that supply and demand in the labor market were coming into better balance while inflation had moderated since the middle of last year it remained well above the committees longerrun goal of percent and participants remained resolute in their commitment to bring inflation down to the committees percent objective participants also noted that tighter financial and credit conditions facing households and businesses would likely weigh on eco nomic activity hiring and inflation although the extent of these effects remained uncertain participants com mented on the significant tightening in financial condi tions in recent months driven by higher longerterm yields with many noting that it was uncertain whether this tightening of financial conditions would persist and to what extent it reflected expectations for tighter policy or other factors amid these economic conditions all participants judged it appropriate to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at to percent at this meeting participants judged that maintaining this restrictive stance of policy at this meeting would support further progress toward the committees goals while al lowing more time to gather additional information to evaluate this progress all participants agreed that it was appropriate to continue the process of reducing the fed eral reserves securities holdings as described in the pre viously announced plans for reducing the size of the federal reserves balance sheet in discussing the policy outlook participants continued to judge that it was critical that the stance of monetary policy be kept sufficiently restrictive to return inflation to the committees percent objective over time all participants agreed that the committee was in a position to proceed carefully and that policy decisions at every meeting would continue to be based on the totality of incoming information and its implications for the eco nomic outlook as well as the balance of risks partici pants noted that further tightening of monetary policy would be appropriate if incoming information indicated that progress toward the committees inflation objective was insufficient participants expected that the data ar riving in coming months would help clarify the extent to which the disinflation process was continuing aggregate demand was moderating in the face of tighter financial and credit conditions and labor markets were reaching a better balance between demand and supply partici pants noted the importance of continuing to communi cate clearly about the committees datadependent ap proach and its firm commitment to bring inflation down to percent all participants judged that it would be appropriate for policy to remain at a restrictive stance for some time un til inflation is clearly moving down sustainably toward the committees objective participants also observed that the continuing process of reducing the size of the federal reserves balance sheet was an important part of the overall approach to achieving their macroeconomic objectives a few participants noted that the process of balance sheet runoff could continue for some time even after the committee begins to reduce the target range for the federal funds rate several participants com mented on the recent decline in the use of the on rrp facility noting that the use of the facility had been re sponsive to market conditions page federal open market committee participants discussed several riskmanagement consid erations that could bear on future policy decisions par ticipants generally judged that with the stance of mone tary policy in restrictive territory risks to the achieve ment of the committees goals had become more two sided but with inflation still well above the committees longerrun goal and the labor market remaining tight most participants continued to see upside risks to infla tion these risks included the possibility that the imbal ance of aggregate demand and supply could persist longer than expected and slow the progress on inflation geopolitical tensions and risks emanating from global oil markets the effects of a tight housing market on shelter inflation and the potential for more limited declines in goods prices many participants commented that even though economic activity had been resilient and the la bor market had continued to be strong downside risks to economic activity remained such risks included po tentially largerthanexpected effects of the tightening in financial and credit conditions on aggregate demand and on bank business and household balance sheets con tinued weakness in the cre sector and potential disrup tions to global oil markets committee policy actions in their discussion of monetary policy for this meeting members agreed that economic activity had expanded at a strong pace in the third quarter job gains had moder ated since earlier in the year but remained strong and the unemployment rate had remained low inflation had remained elevated members concurred that the us banking system was sound and resilient they also agreed that tighter finan cial and credit conditions for households and businesses were likely to weigh on economic activity hiring and in flation but that the extent of these effects was uncertain members agreed that they remained highly attentive to inflation risks

monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the committees goals mem bers also agreed that their assessments would take into account a wide range of information

zakrajsek executive vice president federal reserve bank of boston rebecca zarutskie special adviser to the board division of board members board developments in financial markets and open market operations the manager turned first to a review of developments in financial markets over the intermeeting period finan cial conditions eased driven by a decline in interest rates an increase in equity prices and a depreciation in the dol lar the rise in equity prices was supported by the de cline in treasury yields and by earnings growth that ex ceeded consensus expectations implied volatility for equities diminished notably the easing in financial con ditions reversed some of the tightening that occurred over the summer and much of the fall yields on nominal treasury securities declined sharply over the intermeeting periodmore so at longer matur itiesafter having increased notably during the previous intermeeting period as investors appeared to interpret incoming data as reducing risks of prolonged inflation pressures in addition market participants interpreted communications from fomc participants as solidifying page federal open market committee the view that the committees policy rate may be at its peak early in the period the market also reacted to communications from the treasury department indicat ing that issuance of treasury securities was likely to be more skewed toward shorterdated maturities than pre viously expected models on average suggested that about twothirds of the decline in longerterm yields on treasury securities over the period was attributable to a reduction in term premiums and about onethird to a decline in expectations for the policy rate pricing of in flation derivatives over the intermeeting period sug gested that investors had become more optimistic about the nearterm outlook for inflation the manager turned next to expectations for monetary policy respondents to the open market desks survey of primary dealers and survey of market participants largely converged around the view that the peak level of the federal funds rate for this tightening cycle had been reached the modal path from the desk surveys sug gested that the first reduction in the policy rate would occur in june unchanged from the october surveys the average path for the policy rate implied by market pricing shifted down considerably over the period regarding developments in money markets and desk operations usage of the overnight reverse repurchase agreement on rrp facility continued to fall over the period takeup at the facility had dropped about trillion since early june the decline was again driven primarily by lower participation by money market mutual funds as such funds found it more attractive to invest in treasury bills and increasingly the private mar ket for repurchase agreement repo transactions overnight repo rates continued to experience some modest upward pressure over the period as reflected by a rise in the secured overnight financing rate there was some tightening of conditions in repo markets in late november and early december in response to typi cal lending dynamics around monthend the settlement of a large amount of treasury issuance and increased demand for treasury financing the market absorbed this episode well the manager expected that privatemarket repo rates would likely remain above the rate offered at the on rrp facility which should continue to induce a re duction in usage of the facility respondents to the desk surveys again reduced their expectations for the trajec tory for on rrp balances and correspondingly raised their expectations for the trajectory of reserve balances aggregate reserves across the banking system remained abundant and no signs of pressures were evident as part of their ongoing market surveillance the staff will continue to monitor a wide range of indicators of money market conditions including the composition of bor rowers in money markets borrowing demand for vari ous sources of liquidity the distribution of reserve bal ances across the financial system the pricing of money market investments relative to the federal reserves ad ministered rates and the sensitivity of money market rates to changes in aggregate reserves by unanimous vote the committee ratified the desks domestic transactions over the intermeeting period there were no intervention operations in foreign curren cies for the systems account during the intermeeting pe riod staff review of the economic situation the data available at the time of the december meeting suggested that growth in us real gross domes tic product gdp was slowing from its strong third quarter pace labor market conditions continued to be tight with moderating but stillstrong job gains and a low unemployment rate consumer price inflation had eased over the past year but remained elevated labor demand and supply continued to move gradually into better alignment total nonfarm payroll employ ment expanded at a slower pace on balance over octo ber and november than its average monthly rate in the third quarter the unemployment rate was little changed on net and stood at percent in november the same as its thirdquarter average the labor force participation rate was essentially flat over the past two months remaining above its level early in the year while the employmenttopopulation ratio rose slightly on bal ance the unemployment rates for african americans and for hispanics were little changed and both rates were higher than those for asians and for whites the job openings rate continued to trend down and the quits rate was flat both rates were below their levels earlier this year the lessening of labor market imbalances was apparent in recent wage data as the month change in average hourly earnings for all employees was well below its yearearlier level and the wage growth tracker con structed by the federal reserve bank of atlanta was trending down and lower than a year ago consumer price inflation remained elevated but contin ued to show notable signs of easing the price index for total personal consumption expenditures pce in creased percent over the months ending in octo ber while core pce inflationwhich excludes changes in energy prices and many consumer food priceswas percent over the same period both total and core minutes of the meeting of december page pce inflation were well below their yearearlier levels the sixmonth change measures of total and core pce inflation in october were each percent down from their levels six months earlier the trimmed mean meas ure of month pce inflation constructed by the fed eral reserve bank of dallas was percent in october also down from its level a year ago in november the month change in the consumer price index cpi was percent core cpi rose percent over the same pe riod and both measures were well below their yearear lier levels recent survey measures of medium to longerterm inflation expectations were in the range seen in the decade before the pandemic in contrast survey measures of consumers shortrun inflation expectations remained above their prepandemic levels available indicators suggested that real gdp growth was slowing from its strong thirdquarter pace which had been led by a sizable increase in consumer spending in october pce growth slowed from its average monthly rate in the third quarter as for business invest ment nominal shipments of nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft were essentially flat in october al though nonresidential construction spending by busi nesses edged up residential housing starts moved mostly sideways and home sales continued to fall man ufacturing production declined in october and factory output was weak even after excluding the decrease in motor vehicle assemblies caused by the autoworkers strike the nominal trade deficit widened in october as exports declined and imports rose slightly foreign economic growth slowed in the third quarter and available indicators pointed to subdued growth in the fourth quarter the significant tightening of mone tary policy by foreign central banks over the past two years and the repercussions of last years energy shock in europe continued to weigh on foreign economic activ ity chinese economic indicators such as retail sales and industrial production pointed to economic growth re maining modest by contrast economic activity in asia excluding china stepped up supported in part by a re covery in industrial production especially in the high tech sector while inflation was still elevated in most major econo mies incoming data indicated that it had moved down markedly these decreases reflected notable stepdowns in both energy and core inflation amid slowing aggregate demand and declines in oil prices most major foreign central banks kept their policy rates unchanged over the intermeeting period and emphasized the need to main tain a sufficiently restrictive stance of policy to ensure that inflation fell back to their targets staff review of the financial situation over the intermeeting period some softerthanex pected data releases appeared to lessen the perception among investors that policy may need to tighten further in order to bring inflation down to percent over time market participants also viewed monetary policy com munications on balance as pointing to somewhat less restrictive policy than expected as a result nominal treasury yields declined significantly and the expected marketimplied path for the federal funds rate beyond the next few months shifted downward meanwhile broad equity price indexes were boosted by many of the same factors that lowered treasury yields and spreads on investment and speculativegrade corporate bonds narrowed financing conditions remained moderately restrictive as borrowing costs remained elevated despite declining over the intermeeting period the marketimplied path for the federal funds rate be yond the next few months moved down notably over the intermeeting period a straight read of federal funds fu tures rates suggested that market participants expected the federal funds rate to be basis points below its cur rent level by the may fomc meeting two meet ings earlier than at the time of the octobernovember fomc meeting the policy rate path implied by over night index swap quotes moved down basis points to percent by the end of similarly nominal treas ury yields declined significantly the decline in nominal yields mostly reflected a decrease in real yields while measures of inflation compensation were moderately lower on net amid softerthanexpected data releases measures of uncertainty about the path of interest rates decreased notably consistent with the tempering of con cerns about inflation but remained elevated by historical standards broad stock price indexes increased markedly over the intermeeting period and spreads on investmentgrade bonds narrowed moderately while those on speculative grade corporate bonds declined more notably the one month optionimplied volatility on the sp de creased moderately and reached its lowest level since january spillovers from falling us yields belowexpectations readings on global inflation and oil price drops led to large declines in foreign yields these declines were ac companied by an improvement in market sentiment with foreign equity prices increasing foreign credit page federal open market committee spreads narrowing and outflows from funds investing in emerging market economies slowing notably the im provement in sentiment and declines in us yields con tributed to a broad depreciation of the foreign exchange value of the dollar conditions in us shortterm funding markets remained largely stable over the intermeeting period usage of the on rrp facility continued to decline over the period the decline in usage primarily reflected money market mutual funds reallocating their assets to treasury bills and privatemarket repo which offered slightly more at tractive market rates relative to the on rrp rate amid continued increases in net treasury bill issuance and federal reserve balance sheet reduction banks total deposit levels were roughly unchanged over the inter meeting period as outflows of core deposits were about offset by inflows of large time deposits in domestic credit markets borrowing costs for most businesses households and municipalities declined over the intermeeting period reflecting both lower longer maturity treasury yields and narrower credit spreads al though borrowing costs remained significantly elevated rates on loans to households including those for year conforming residential mortgages and new auto loans declined over the intermeeting period while inter est rates on commercial and industrial ci loans and small business loans were little changed yields on cor porate bonds fell more than treasury yields particularly for speculativegrade bonds bank credit conditions appeared to tighten somewhat over the intermeeting period but credit to businesses and households generally remained accessible ci loan balances contracted through november on balance while expansion of commercial real estate cre loans stepped down appreciably across most categories from an already moderating pace in the third quarter credit remained available for most consumers although consumer credit flows softened in recent months growth of credit card balances moderated significantly through november from the brisk pace seen in the sum mer for residential real estate borrowers credit availa bility was little changed credit conditions for small businesses appeared to have tightened further in recent months data from the federal reserves small busi ness lending survey showed that originations had been roughly flat since mid before ticking down in the third quarter credit continued to be generally accessible through capital markets although issuance was slow in many markets including those for corporate bonds lev eraged loans and agency and nonagency commercial mortgagebased securities cmbs credit quality remained broadly solid but deteriorated further for some sectors in recent months delinquency rates on nonfarm nonresidential cre bank loans rose further in the third quarter and delinquency rates for construction and land development as well as multifam ily loans ticked up after increases over the first three quarters of the year delinquency rates for loans in cmbs pools edged lower in october but the large volume of loans scheduled to mature over the next few quarters suggested that delinquencies would likely surge again the delinquency rate for small business loans continued to tick up in september and was above levels observed just before the pandemic credit card delinquency rates also increased further while delinquency rates on auto loans were little changed in the third quarter the trail ing default rates for investment and speculativegrade corporate bonds were little changed on net and the trail ing default rate for leveraged loans increased a bit staff economic outlook the economic forecast prepared by the staff for the de cember meeting was broadly similar to the projection for the previous meeting the staff continued to expect that gdp growth would slow markedly in the fourth quarter from its outsized thirdquarter rate but that economic growth for as a whole would still be solid the lagged effects of earlier monetary policy actions through their contributions to continued tight financial and credit conditions were expected to show through more fully in restraining economic activity in the coming years real gdp was projected to increase more slowly than the staffs estimate of potential over the next two years be fore rising in line with potential in the unemploy ment rate was expected to be roughly flat through as the effects of belowpotential output growth were off set by the effects of further improvements in labor mar ket functioning the staff revised down their inflation forecast reflecting lowerthanexpected incoming dataincluding the no vember cpi and producer price indexand their judg ment that inflation would be less persistent than in the previous projection measured on a fourquarter change basis total pce price inflation was expected to be some what below percent this year with core pce price in flation somewhat above percent inflation was pro jected to move lower in coming years as demand and supply in product and labor markets moved into better minutes of the meeting of december page alignment by total and core pce price inflation were expected to be close to percent the staff continued to view uncertainty around the base line projection as elevated although they observed that the volatility of incoming data and staff forecast errors generally had become less pronounced over the past year risks around the inflation forecast were seen as skewed to the upside given that inflation was still ele vated and the possibility that inflation might prove to be more persistent than expected or that adverse shocks to supply conditions might occur the risks around the forecast for economic activity were viewed to be tilted to the downside in particular the additional monetary policy tightening that could be put in place if upside in flation risks were to materialize with the potential for a greater tightening of financial conditions represented a downside risk to the projection for economic activity participants views on current conditions and the economic outlook in conjunction with this fomc meeting participants submitted their projections of the most likely outcomes for real gdp growth the unemployment rate and infla tion for each year from through and over the longer run the projections were based on their individ ual assessments of appropriate monetary policy includ ing the path of the federal funds rate the longerrun projections represented each participants assessment of the rate to which each variable would be expected to converge over time under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy a summary of economic projections sep was released to the public following the conclusion of the meeting in their discussion of current economic conditions par ticipants observed that after stronger than expected growth of real gdp in the third quarter recent indica tors suggested that growth in economic activity had slowed while still strong job gains had moderated since earlier this year and the unemployment rate had re mained low participants observed that inflation had eased over the past year but remained elevated and above the committees longerrun goal of percent regarding the economic outlook participants generally judged that in real gdp growth would cool and that rebalancing of the labor market would continue with the unemployment rate rising somewhat from its current level based on betterthanexpected data on in flation participants revised down their inflation projec tions for and to a lesser extent in subsequent years participants judged that the current stance of monetary policy was restrictive and appeared to be re straining economic activity and inflation in light of the policy restraint in place along with more favorable data on inflation participants generally viewed risks to infla tion and employment as moving toward greater balance however participants remained highly attentive to infla tion risks in their discussion of inflation all participants observed that clear progress had been made in toward the committees percent inflation objective they re mained concerned that elevated inflation continued to harm households especially those with limited means to absorb higher prices participants observed that infla tion remained above the committees objective and that they would need to see more evidence that inflation pressures were abating to become confident in a sus tained return of inflation to percent in reviewing progress to date in reducing inflation par ticipants noted the improvement in both headline and core inflation and discussed the developments in com ponents of these aggregate measures they observed that progress had been uneven across components with energy and core goods prices falling or changing little recently but core services prices still increasing at an el evated pace several participants observed that the on going rebalancing of labor supply and demand would help reduce core services inflation several participants assessed that housing services inflation would fall fur ther over time as the earlier deceleration in rents on new leases continued to pass through to broader rent measures participants also discussed the role played by various supply and demand factors in the progress on reducing inflation thus far they assessed that the con tribution of improved supply had come from supply chain normalization boosts to labor supply due to a higher labor force participation rate and immigration better productivity growth or increased domestic oil production they also noted that restrictive monetary policy had helped restrain growth of demand particu larly in interestsensitive sectors such as business fixed investment housing and autos and other durable goods several participants assessed that healing in supply chains and labor supply was largely complete and there fore that continued progress in reducing inflation may need to come mainly from further softening in product and labor demand with restrictive monetary policy con tinuing to play a central role a few others saw potential for further improvements in supply several participants noted that longerterm inflation expectations remained well anchored and that nearterm inflation expectations of households had declined recently page federal open market committee in their comments about the household sector partici pants observed that consumer spending had been strong supported by the healthy balance sheets of many households a strong labor market and robust income growth retail sales growth had stepped down noticea bly in october though a few participants remarked that contacts reported strong sales in november notably re lated to holiday spending participants mentioned sev eral factors that may contribute to softer consumer spending including slower growth of labor income and diminishing pandemicrelated excess savings relatedly many participants noted increased usage of credit by households including from credit cards buynowpay later borrowing and payday loans as well as increased delinquency rates for many types of consumer loans reports from participants businesssector contacts were mixed with some contacts remaining relatively optimis tic and others expecting slower growth for several participants observed that higher interest rates were leading firms to reassess future projects and were con tributing to softer business investment and hiring a couple of participants commented on small businesses noting that such businesses were experiencing tighter credit conditions and increasing delinquencies a few participants noted that contacts in manufacturing re ported slowing growth while a couple of participants ex pected that low prices for some commodities and drought conditions would reduce agricultural incomes this year regarding concerns about cre several par ticipants noted that a significant share of properties would need to be refinanced in against a backdrop of higher interest rates continued weakness in the office sector and balance sheet pressures faced by some lend ers participants assessed that while the labor market re mained tight it continued to come into better balance many noted that nominal wage growth had continued to slow broadly and that business contacts expected a fur ther reduction in wage growth a few participants ob served that payroll growth had slowed substantially since the beginning of the year some participants remarked that their contacts reported larger applicant pools for va cancies and some participants highlighted that the ratio of vacancies to unemployed workers had declined to a value only modestly above its level just before the pan demic participants viewed improvements in labor sup ply and the easing of labor demand as both having con tributed to the labor market coming into better balance supply had improved because of higher labor force par ticipation and immigration with continued solid produc tivity growth also supporting the productive capacity of the economy as evidence for the softening of the growth of labor demand during many participants noted the decline in job openings and a few remarked on the lower quits rate several participants noted the risk that if labor demand were to weaken substantially further the labor market could transition quickly from a gradual easing to a more abrupt downshift in conditions participants generally perceived a high degree of uncer tainty surrounding the economic outlook as an upside risk to both inflation and economic activity participants noted that the momentum of economic activity may be stronger than currently assessed possibly on account of the continued balance sheet strength of many house holds furthermore participants observed that after a sharp tightening since the summer financial conditions had eased over the intermeeting period many partici pants remarked that an easing in financial conditions be yond what is appropriate could make it more difficult for the committee to reach its inflation goal participants also noted other sources of upside risks to inflation in cluding possible effects on global energy and food prices of geopolitical developments a potential rebound in core goods prices following the period of supply chain improvements or the effects of nearshoring and on shoring activities on labor demand and inflation down side risks to economic activity noted by participants in cluded the possibility that effects of past policy tighten ing may be larger than expected the risk of a marked weakening of household balance sheets possible nega tive spillovers from lower growth in some foreign econ omies geopolitical risks and lingering risks of further tightening in bank credit relatedly several participants noted that the weakness in gross domestic income growth relative to gdp growth over the past few quar ters may suggest that economic momentum during that period was not as strong as indicated by the gdp read ings in their consideration of appropriate monetary policy ac tions at this meeting participants noted that recent indi cators suggested that growth of economic activity had slowed from its strong pace in the third quarter job gains had moderated since earlier in the year but re mained strong the unemployment rate had remained low and there were continuing signs that supply and de mand in the labor market were coming into better bal ance inflation had eased over the past year but re mained elevated participants also noted that tighter fi nancial and credit conditions facing households and businesses would likely weigh on economic activity hir ing and inflation although the extent of these effects minutes of the meeting of december page remained uncertain participants continued to be reso lute in their commitment to bring inflation down to the committees percent objective in light of current economic conditions and their impli cations for the outlook for economic activity and infla tion as well as the balance of risks all participants judged it appropriate to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at to percent at this meeting all par ticipants also agreed that it was appropriate to continue the process of reducing the federal reserves securities holdings as described in the previously announced plans for reducing the size of the federal reserves balance sheet participants assessed that maintaining the current policy stance was supported by intermeeting data indicating that inflation had continued to move toward the com mittees percent objective and that the labor market had continued to move into better balance they judged that maintaining the target range for the federal funds rate at this meeting would promote further progress to ward the committees goals and allow participants more time to gather additional information to evaluate this progress in discussing the policy outlook participants viewed the policy rate as likely at or near its peak for this tightening cycle though they noted that the actual policy path will depend on how the economy evolves participants pointed to the decline in inflation seen during not ing the recent shift down in sixmonth inflation readings in particular and to growing signs of demand and supply coming into better balance in product and labor markets as informing that view several participants remarked that the committees past policy actions were having their intended effect of helping to slow the growth of aggregate demand and cool labor market conditions they judged that in combination with improvements in the supply situation these developments were helping to bring inflation back to percent over time most partic ipants noted that as indicated in their submissions to the sep they expected the committees restrictive policy stance to continue to soften household and business spending helping to promote further reductions in in flation over the next few years in their submitted projections almost all participants in dicated that reflecting the improvements in their infla tion outlooks their baseline projections implied that a lower target range for the federal funds rate would be appropriate by the end of participants also noted however that their outlooks were associated with an un usually elevated degree of uncertainty and that it was possible that the economy could evolve in a manner that would make further increases in the target range appro priate several also observed that circumstances might warrant keeping the target range at its current value for longer than they currently anticipated participants gen erally stressed the importance of maintaining a careful and datadependent approach to making monetary pol icy decisions and reaffirmed that it would be appropriate for policy to remain at a restrictive stance for some time until inflation was clearly moving down sustainably to ward the committees objective participants discussed several riskmanagement consid erations that could bear on future policy decisions par ticipants saw upside risks to inflation as having dimin ished but noted that inflation was still well above the committees longerrun goal and that a risk remained that progress toward price stability would stall a num ber of participants highlighted the uncertainty associated with how long a restrictive monetary policy stance would need to be maintained and pointed to the downside risks to the economy that would be associated with an overly restrictive stance a few suggested that the com mittee potentially could face a tradeoff between its dual mandate goals in the period ahead participants observed that the continuing process of re ducing the size of the federal reserves balance sheet was an important part of the committees overall ap proach to achieving its macroeconomic objectives and that balance sheet runoff had so far proceeded smoothly several participants noted that amid the ongoing bal ance sheet normalization there had been a further de cline over the intermeeting period in use of the on rrp facility and that this reduced usage largely reflected port folio shifts by money market mutual funds toward higheryielding investments including treasury bills and privatemarket repo several participants remarked that the committees balance sheet plans indicated that it would slow and then stop the decline in the size of the balance sheet when reserve balances are somewhat above the level judged consistent with ample reserves these participants suggested that it would be appropri ate for the committee to begin to discuss the technical factors that would guide a decision to slow the pace of runoff well before such a decision was reached in order to provide appropriate advance notice to the public committee policy actions in their discussions of monetary policy for this meeting members agreed that recent indicators suggested that growth of economic activity had slowed from its strong pace in the third quarter job gains had moderated since page federal open market committee earlier in the year but remained strong and the unem ployment rate had remained low inflation had eased over the past year but remained elevated members concurred that the us banking system was sound and resilient they also agreed that tighter finan cial and credit conditions for households and businesses were likely to weigh on economic activity hiring and in flation but that the extent of these effects was uncertain members agreed that they remained highly attentive to inflation risks in support of the committees objective to achieve max imum employment and inflation at the rate of percent over the longer run members agreed to maintain the tar get range for the federal funds rate at to percent they also agreed that they would continue to assess ad ditional information and its implications for monetary policy in determining the extent of any additional pol icy firming that may be appropriate to return inflation to percent over time members concurred that they would take into account the cumulative tightening of monetary policy the lags with which monetary policy affects eco nomic activity and inflation and economic and financial developments in addition members agreed to continue to reduce the federal reserves holdings of treasury se curities and agency debt and agency mortgagebacked securities as described in its previously announced plans all members affirmed their strong commitment to returning inflation to their percent objective members agreed that in assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy they would continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook they would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the committees goals mem bers also agreed that their assessments would take into account a wide range of information including readings on labor market conditions inflation pressures and in flation expectations and financial and international de velopments members agreed that their postmeeting statement should acknowledge the slowing of economic activity from its strong pace in the third quarter as well as the fact that inflation had eased over the past year but re mained elevated members also agreed to modify the sentence in their postmeeting statement discussing the considerations relevant for future policy actions to indi cate that the committee would determine the extent of any additional policy firming that may be appropriate to return inflation to percent over time members gen erally viewed the addition of the word any to this sen tence as appropriately relaying their judgment that the target range for the federal funds rate was likely now at or near its peak for this policy tightening cycle while leaving open the possibility of further increases in the target range if these were warranted by the totality of the incoming data the evolving outlook and the balance of risks at the conclusion of the discussion the

repurchase agreement operations ahead of the vote on policies relating to investment and trading information security and external communica tions the chair commented on the critical importance of

the next fiveyear review of the statement would begin in the latter half of this year and the results would be announced about a year later all participants indicated support for the statement on longerrun goals and monetary policy strategy and the committee voted unanimously to reaffirm it without revision developments in financial markets and open market operations the manager turned first to a review of developments in financial markets over the intermeeting period finan cial conditions eased modestly but remained about as tight as they were last summer and much tighter than when the hiking cycle began over the intermeeting pe riod declines in nominal treasury yields were concen trated at the front end of the yield curve staff models suggested that the declines in shorterterm yields were mostly attributable to a lower expected policy rate path and were concentrated in expected real rates while ex pected inflation was little changed pricing of inflation derivatives continued to suggest a nearterm path of in flation consistent with a return to percent later this year broad equity prices reached new highs over the intermeeting period but they were driven mostly by the strong gains of largecapitalization technology compa nies broader measures of equity valuations were more subdued still equities appeared priced for continued economic resilience the manager turned next to expectations for monetary policy market participants broadly viewed recent infla tion data and the december summary of economic pro jections sep as increasing the odds that rate cuts might start sooner than previously thought the modal path of the federal funds rate from the open market desks survey of primary dealers and survey of market partic ipants was little changed from december but showed an increased likelihood of earlier rate cuts the modal path implied by options prices declined some over the inter meeting period both modal paths were closer to the december median sep projection than the average path for the policy rate implied by futures prices which had declined more substantially over the period the fu turesbased path likely reflected the effect of investors perceived probability of more substantial rate cuts rather than their baseline expectations communications over the period heightened market at tention around a potential slowing of balance sheet run off most desk survey respondents expected a slowing of the pace to start by july although there was consider able uncertainty about the exact start date the average expected timing for the end of runoff shifted slightly ear lier and the portfolio size at the end of runoff was slightly higher than in the december surveys regarding developments in money markets and desk operations the effective federal funds rate was stable over the intermeeting period while the secured over night financing rate experienced temporary and modest upward pressure over the past few monthends includ ing the yearend such a pattern was common before the pandemic the usage of the overnight reverse repur chase agreement on rrp facility continued to fall over the period with balances below billion in late january since june when the debt ceiling was sus pended usage of the on rrp facility had declined at a much faster pace than the federal reserve securities portfolio and reserve balances had increased some as part of its ongoing market surveillance the staff con tinued to monitor a wide range of money market indica tors those gauges suggested that the supply of reserves remained abundant the staff also noted that once the on rrp facility is either depleted or stabilized at a low level reserves will decline at a pace comparable with the runoff of the federal reserves securities portfolio all else equal by unanimous vote the committee ratified the desks domestic transactions over the intermeeting period there were no intervention operations in foreign curren cies for the systems account

the fourth quarter of but had stepped down from the third quarters strong pace labor market conditions continued to be tight but showed further signs of easing consumer price infla tion had declined markedly over the course of the year though it remained above percent labor demand and supply continued to gradually move into better alignment the average monthly pace of nonfarm payroll employment

consumer goods and autos all told net exports contributed about percentage point to us gdp growth in the fourth quarter after making roughly neutral contributions in the preceding two quar ters foreign economic growth remained subdued in the fourth quarter in the advanced foreign economies afes a significant tightening of monetary policy over the past two years the erosion of real household

global demand for hightech prod ucts foreign headline inflation continued to fall however the pace of decline had varied across countries as well as sectors with a moderation in goods prices generally hav ing outpaced that in services prices most major foreign central banks kept their policy rates unchanged over the intermeeting period and emphasized the need to main tain a stance of policy that is sufficiently restrictive to ensure that inflation falls back to their targets staff review of the financial situation over the intermeeting period nominal treasury yields declined and the expected marketimplied path for the federal funds rate through shifted downward as market participants viewed monetary policy communi cations on balance as pointing to notably less restrictive policy than

and businesses continued to be moderately restrictive as borrowing costs remained elevated the marketimplied path for the federal funds rate through decreased over the intermeeting period a straight

increased slightly conditions in shortterm funding markets remained sta ble over the intermeeting period with typical dynamics observed surrounding yearend usage of the on rrp facility continued to decline over the period primarily reflecting money market funds reallocating their assets to treasury bills and privatemarket repurchase agree ments which offered slightly more attractive market rates relative to the on rrp rate banks total deposit levels were roughly unchanged in the fourth quarter of last year as outflows of core deposits were about offset by inflows of large time deposits in domestic credit markets borrowing costs for most businesses households and municipalities decreased moderately over the intermeeting period but remained elevated rates on loans to households declined over the intermeeting period but remained relatively high while interest rates on existing credit card accounts were little changed interest rates on commercial and indus trial ci loans and small business loans increased over the intermeeting period yields declined on a broad ar ray of fixedincome securities including investment and speculativegrade corporate bonds residential and com mercial

money market mutual funds and other cash management vehi cles continued to increase page federal open market committee staff economic outlook the economic forecast prepared by the staff for the jan uary meeting was slightly stronger than the december projection as the upward revision to gdp growth implied by incoming data boosted the level of output throughout the projection period the lagged effects of earlier monetary policy actions through their continued contribution to tight financial and credit conditions were still expected to push output growth in and below the staffs estimate of potential growth in output was expected to rise in line with potential the projected path for the unemployment rate was re vised down slightly reflecting the upward revision to the level of output total and core pce price inflation were both projected to step down in as demand and supply in product and labor markets moved into better alignment by total and core pce price inflation were expected to be close to percent the staff continued to view the uncertainty around the baseline projection as elevated but noted that this uncer tainty had diminished substantially over the past year risks around the inflation forecast were seen as tilted slightly to the upside although inflation had come in close to expectations throughout most of the staff placed some weight on the possibility that further pro gress in reducing inflation could take longer than ex pected the risks around the forecast for real activity were viewed as skewed to the downside as any substan tial setback in reducing inflation might lead to a tighten ing of financial conditions that would slow the pace of real activity by more than the staff anticipated in their baseline forecast in addition the possibility of a larger thanexpected erosion of households financial positions was seen as a downside risk to the projection for real activity participants views on current conditions and the economic outlook in their discussion of current economic conditions par ticipants noted that recent indicators suggested that eco nomic activity had been expanding at a solid pace real gdp growth in the fourth quarter of last year came in above percent at an annual rate below the strong growth posted in the third quarter but still above most forecasters expectations participants observed that the unexpected strength in real gdp growth in the fourth quarter reflected strongerthanexpected net exports and inventory investment which tend to be volatile and may carry little signal for future growth still consumption continued to grow at a solid pace in addition to strong demand many participants attributed the recent expan sion in economic activity to favorable supply develop ments participants noted that the pace of job gains had moderated since early last year but remained strong and that the unemployment rate had remained low inflation had eased over the past year but remained elevated regarding the economic outlook participants judged that the current stance of monetary policy was restrictive and would continue to put downward pressure on eco nomic activity and inflation accordingly they expected that supply and demand in product and labor markets would continue to move into better balance in light of the policy restraint in place along with more favorable inflation data amid ongoing improvements in supply conditions participants viewed the risks to achieving the committees employment and inflation goals as moving into better balance however participants noted that the economic outlook was uncertain and that they re mained highly attentive to inflation risks in their discussion of inflation participants observed that inflation had eased over the past year but remained above the committees percent inflation objective they remained concerned that elevated inflation contin ued to harm households especially those with limited means to absorb higher prices while the inflation data had indicated significant disinflation in the second half of last year participants observed that they would be carefully assessing incoming data in judging whether in flation was moving down sustainably toward percent participants noted improvements in both headline and core inflation and discussed the underlying components of these series although total pce inflation in decem ber remained above the committees percent objective on a month basis on a month basis total pce in flation was near percent at an annual rate and core pce inflation was just below percent participants judged that some of the recent improvement in inflation reflected idiosyncratic movements in a few series nev ertheless they viewed that there had been significant progress recently on inflation returning to the commit tees longerrun goal many participants indicated that they expected core nonhousing services inflation to gradually decline further as the labor market continued to move into better balance and wage growth moderated further various participants noted that housing services inflation was likely to fall further as the deceleration in rents on new leases continued to pass through to measures of such inflation while many participants pointed to disinflationary pressures associated with im provements in aggregate supplysuch as increases in the labor force or better productivity growtha couple minutes of the meeting of january page of participants judged that the downward pressure on core goods prices from the normalization of supply chains was likely to moderate participants observed that longerterm inflation expec tations had remained well anchored at a level consistent with the committees percent inflation objective measures of nearterm inflation expectations had also declined recently in some cases to within their ranges in the years before the pandemic some participants pointed to reports from contacts that firms could not as easily pass on price increases to consumers or were mak ing less frequent price adjustments than they had in re cent years in their discussion of the household sector participants observed that consumer spending had been stronger than expected supported by low unemployment and solid income growth a number of participants judged that consumption growth was likely to moderate this year as growth in labor income was expected to slow and pandemicrelated excess savings were expected to diminish in addition some participants noted signs that the finances of some householdsespecially those in the low and moderateincome categorieswere in creasingly coming under pressure which these partici pants saw as a downside risk to the outlook for con sumption in particular they pointed to increased usage of credit card revolving balances and buynowpaylater services as well as increased delinquency rates for some types of consumer loans the reports of business contacts cited by participants varied across industries and districts in a few districts contacts reported that the pace of economic activity was steady or solid while in several others contacts ex pressed increased optimism about the economic outlook and prospects for investment district reports from manufacturers were mixed as some contacts saw in creased activity whereas others saw subdued or weaken ing activity a couple of participants noted that although soft commodity prices and elevated borrowing costs had contributed to a decline in farm incomes recently agri cultural land values remained resilient and delinquencies on farm loans continued to be low a few participants remarked that financing and credit conditions were par ticularly challenging for small businesses participants noted that the labor market remained tight but demand and supply in that market had continued to come into better balance payroll growth had remained strong in the last few months of but had slowed from its pace seen a year ago while the unemployment rate remained low participants also observed that the ratio of job openings to unemployed workers had de clined over the past year but still remained somewhat above its prepandemic level consistent with a reduc tion in labor market tightness business contacts in sev eral districts reported an easing in wage pressures or an increased ability to hire and retain workers participants mentioned several developments that had boosted labor supply last year including higher labor force participa tion immigration and an improved jobmatching pro cess however a few participants judged that further in creases in labor supply may be limited pointing for in stance to the decline in labor force participation in de cember while labor market conditions were generally seen as strong several participants noted that recent job gains were concentrated in a few sectors which in their view pointed to downside risks to the outlook for em ployment participants discussed the uncertainty surrounding the economic outlook as an upside risk to both inflation and economic activity participants noted that momen tum in aggregate demand may be stronger than currently assessed especially in light of surprisingly resilient con sumer spending last year furthermore several partici pants mentioned the risk that financial conditions were or could become less restrictive than appropriate which could add undue momentum to aggregate demand and cause progress on inflation to stall participants also noted some other sources of upside risks to inflation in cluding possible disruptions to supply chains from geo political developments a potential rebound in core goods prices as the effects of supplyside improvements dissipate or the possibility that wage growth remains el evated downside risks to inflation and economic activ ity noted by participants included geopolitical risks that could result in a material pullback in demand possible negative spillovers from lower growth in some foreign economies the risk that financial conditions could re main restrictive for too long or the possibility that a weakening of household balance sheets could contribute to a greaterthanexpected deceleration in consumption a few participants mentioned the possibility that eco nomic activity could surprise to the upside and inflation to the downside because of morefavorablethanex pected supplyside developments in the discussion of financial stability participants ob served that risks to the banking system had receded no tably since last spring though they noted vulnerabilities at some banks that they assessed warranted monitoring these participants noted potential risks for some banks associated with increased funding costs significant reli ance on uninsured deposits unrealized losses on assets page federal open market committee resulting from the rise in longerterm interest rates or high cre exposures participants judged that liquidity in the financial system remained more than ample and discussed the importance of considering liquidity condi tions as the federal reserves balance sheet continues to normalize while participants noted that they were not seeing any signs of liquidity pressures at banks several participants noted that as a matter of prudent contin gency planning banks should continue to improve their readiness to use the federal reserves discount window and that the federal reserve should continue to improve the operational efficiency of the window in addition some participants commented on the difficulties associ ated with banks relying on some forms of private whole sale funding during times of stress a few participants remarked on the importance of measures aimed at in creasing the resilience of the treasury market a few participants noted cyber risks and the importance of firms being able to recover from cyber events a few participants also commented on the financial condition of low and moderateincome households who have ex hausted their savings as well as the importance of mon itoring data on rising delinquencies on credit cards and autos in their consideration of appropriate monetary policy ac tions at this meeting participants noted that recent indi cators suggested that economic activity had been ex panding at a solid pace job gains had moderated since early last year but remained strong and the unemploy ment rate had remained low inflation had eased over the past year but remained elevated participants also noted that the risks to achieving the committees em ployment and inflation goals were moving into better balance and that the committee remained highly atten tive to inflation risks participants continued to be reso lute in their commitment to bring inflation down to the committees percent objective in light of current economic conditions and their impli cations for the outlook for economic activity and infla tion as well as the balance of risks all participants judged it appropriate to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at to percent at this meeting all par ticipants also judged it appropriate to continue the pro cess of reducing the federal reserves securities hold ings as described in the previously announced plans for reducing the size of the federal reserves balance sheet participants viewed maintaining the current stance of policy as appropriate given the incoming data which in dicated that inflation had continued to move toward the committees percent objective and that demand and supply in the labor market had continued to move into better balance participants commented that maintain ing the target range for the federal funds rate at this meeting would promote further progress toward the committees goals and allow participants to gather addi tional information to evaluate this progress in discussing the policy outlook participants judged that the policy rate was likely at its peak for this tightening cycle they pointed to the decline in inflation seen dur ing and to growing signs of demand and supply coming into better balance in product and labor markets as informing that view participants generally noted that they did not expect it would be appropriate to reduce the target range for the federal funds rate until they had gained greater confidence that inflation was moving sus tainably toward percent many participants remarked that the committees past policy actions and ongoing improvements in supply conditions were working to gether to move supply and demand into better balance participants noted that the future path of the policy rate would depend on incoming data the evolving outlook and the balance of risks several participants empha sized the importance of continuing to communicate clearly about the committees datadependent approach in discussing riskmanagement considerations that could bear on the policy outlook participants remarked that while the risks to achieving the committees em ployment and inflation goals were moving into better balance they remained highly attentive to inflation risks in particular they saw upside risks to inflation as having diminished but noted that inflation was still above the committees longerrun goal some participants noted the risk that progress toward price stability could stall particularly if aggregate demand strengthened or supply side healing slowed more than expected participants highlighted the uncertainty associated with how long a restrictive monetary policy stance would need to be maintained most participants noted the risks of moving too quickly to ease the stance of policy and emphasized the importance of carefully assessing incoming data in judging whether inflation is moving down sustainably to percent a couple of participants however pointed to downside risks to the economy associated with main taining an overly restrictive stance for too long participants observed that the continuing process of re ducing the size of the federal reserves balance sheet was an important part of the committees overall ap proach to achieving its macroeconomic objectives and that balance sheet runoff had so far proceeded smoothly in light of ongoing reductions in usage of the on rrp minutes of the meeting of january page facility many participants suggested that it would be ap propriate to begin indepth discussions of balance sheet issues at the committees next meeting to guide an even tual decision to slow the pace of runoff some partici pants remarked that given the uncertainty surrounding estimates of the ample level of reserves slowing the pace of runoff could help smooth the transition to that level of reserves or could allow the committee to continue balance sheet runoff for longer in addition a few par ticipants noted that the process of balance sheet runoff could continue for some time even after the committee begins to reduce the target range for the federal funds rate committee policy actions in their discussions of monetary policy for this meeting members agreed that economic activity had been ex panding at a solid pace job gains had moderated since early last year but remained strong and the unemploy ment rate had remained low inflation had eased over the past year but remained elevated members judged that the risks to achieving the committees employment and inflation goals were moving into better balance members viewed the economic outlook to be uncertain and agreed that they remained highly attentive to infla tion risks in support of the committees goals to achieve maxi mum employment and inflation at the rate of percent over the longer run members agreed to maintain the tar get range for the federal funds rate at to percent members concurred that in considering any adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate they would carefully assess incoming data the evolving outlook and the balance of risks members agreed that they did not expect that it would be appropriate to reduce the target range until they have gained greater confidence that in flation is moving sustainably toward percent in addi tion members agreed to continue to reduce the federal reserves holdings of treasury securities and agency debt and agency mortgagebacked securities as de scribed in its previously announced plans all members affirmed their strong commitment to returning inflation to the committees percent objective members agreed that in assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy they would continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook they would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the committees goals mem bers also agreed that their assessments would take into account a wide range of information including readings on labor market conditions inflation pressures and in flation expectations and financial and international de velopments given that the stresses that emerged at some banks early last year have subsided members agreed to remove from the statement the reference to the resilience of the us banking system as well as to tighter financial and credit conditions and their effects on the economic outlook members also agreed to note the progress made toward the percent inflation objective and the resilience of economic activity over the past year by stating that the committee judges that the risks to achieving its em ployment and inflation goals are moving into better bal ance regarding considerations relevant for future pol icy actions members agreed given their assessment of the policy rate being likely at its peak for this tightening cycle to remove the reference to the extent of any ad ditional policy firming that may be appropriate to return inflation to percent over time as was included in the december statement in its place they agreed to adopt phrasing referencing their considering any adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate members also agreed that the statement should convey that the committee will carefully assess incoming data the evolving outlook and the balance of risks and that it does not expect it will be appropriate to reduce the tar get range until it has gained greater confidence that in flation is moving sustainably toward percent at the conclusion of the discussion the committee voted to direct the federal reserve bank of new york until instructed otherwise to execute transactions in the soma in accordance with the following domestic

members board developments in financial markets and open market operations the manager turned first to a review of developments in financial markets over the intermeeting period us fi nancial conditions had eased modestly since the january fomc meeting with higher equity prices more than off setting increases in interest rates nominal treasury yields had risen over the intermeeting period at shorter maturities most of the increase was attributable to a rise in inflation compensation prompted by indications that the decline in inflation was proceeding somewhat more slowly than markets in recent months had been expect ing in contrast at longer maturities much of the in crease in treasury yields was due to a rise in real rates reflecting solid labor market readings and strongerthan expected data on economic activity the manager turned next to policy rate expectations an estimate of the expected federal funds rate path derived from futures prices shifted up significantly over the in termeeting period the modal federal funds rate path implied by options prices had also risen but by substan tially less than the futuresimplied path the move up in the futuresimplied path reflected in part some shift in expectations toward policy rate cuts beginning later in the year and cumulating to a smaller rate reduction in than previously assessed investors also appeared to have considerably lowered the perceived probability of more substantial rate cuts than in their baseline ex pectations this lowering was evident in significantly more concentrated probability distributions for the fed eral funds rate over coming quarters the changes in policy rate expectations over the intermeeting period oc curred in the wake of stronger economic data percep tions that disinflation might be proceeding more slowly than previously thought and federal reserve communi cations the median of modal paths of the federal funds rate obtained from the open market desks survey of primary dealers and survey of market participants was also slightly higher responses still indicated substantial differences among survey participants in their assess ments of the total amount of rate cuts likely to occur this year the manager then discussed expectations regarding bal ance sheet policy survey responses reflected judgments that the committees slowing of balance sheet runoff would begin slightly later than previously expected with the majority of survey participants now expecting the slowing to start around midyear balance sheet runoff was expected to continue for some time thereafter and survey responses suggested a slightly smaller balance sheet size at the end of runoff than respondents had pre viously assessed the manager noted that broad equity prices had reached new highs over the intermeeting period this growth was again driven primarily by the strong increases in val uations of largecapitalization technology companies while broader equity price gains were more measured recent bank equity price behavior reflected renewed market attention on the challenges faced by the regional banking sector particularly that sectors exposures to commercial real estate cre in global financial mar kets the expected policy rate path in most advanced for eign economies afes shifted up over the intermeeting period at the end of the intermeeting period the bank of japan boj announced that it would discontinue its policies of a negative shortterm interest rate and yield curve control this decision was largely expected by in vestors and the bojs announcement had a limited ef fect on global financial markets conditions in us money markets had been stable over the intermeeting period with less upward pressure on repurchase agreement repo rates than in recent inter meeting periods the usage of the overnight reverse re purchase agreement on rrp facility had continued to decline albeit at a somewhat slower pace than that seen over the second half of staff projections sug gested that total on rrp balances might stabilize in coming months at either zero or a low level this as sessment was also supported by information acquired in desk outreach efforts the manager provided an update on indicators of re serve conditions over the past few years rate control had been effective with the effective federal funds rate being firmly within the committees target range the minutes of the meeting of march page staff assessed that over the intermeeting period the fed eral funds rate continued to be insensitive to daytoday changes in the supply of reserves this outcome to gether with various other indicators of reserve condi tions supported the conclusion that reserves remained abundant the manager noted that there was neverthe less significant uncertainty about the demand for re serves and that under the current pace of runoff of the federal reserves securities portfolio stabilization in to tal on rrp balances would all else equal cause re serves to start declining at a rapid rate by unanimous vote the committee ratified the desks domestic transactions over the intermeeting period there were no intervention operations in foreign curren cies for the systems account during the intermeeting pe riod considerations for slowing the pace of balance sheet reduction participants began a discussion related to slowing the pace of balance sheet runoff consistent with the com mittees plans for reducing the size of the federal re serves balance sheet announced in may those plans indicated that in order to ensure a smooth transi tion the committee intends to slow and then stop the decline in the size of the balance sheet when reserve bal ances are somewhat above the level it judges to be con sistent with ample reserves since balance sheet runoff began in june the federal reserves total securities holdings had declined roughly trillion in light of the ongoing sizable decline in the balance sheet and the prospect of a more rapid decline in reserve balances par ticipants agreed that their discussions at this meeting would help inform the committees future decisions re garding how and when to slow the pace of runoff no decisions about adjusting the pace of balance sheet run off were made at the meeting the participants discussion was preceded by staff presentations the staff reviewed the balance sheet runoff episode and the lessons learned from that experience including the importance of monitoring money market conditions in light of the uncertainty sur rounding the level of reserves consistent with operating in an amplereserves regime the staff presented a set of simulations in which the current monthly pace of se curities runoff was reduced to illustrate how the choice of when to start slowing the pace of runoff could affect the paths for the balance sheet and reserve balances the simulations showed how various options for when to slow the pace of runoff could affect the duration of each of the expected phases of the transition to an ample level of reserves participants observed that balance sheet runoff was pro ceeding smoothly nevertheless taking into account the experience around the end of the balance sheet runoff episode participants broadly assessed it would be appropriate to take a cautious approach to further run off the vast majority of participants thus judged it would be prudent to begin slowing the pace of runoff fairly soon most of these participants noted that de spite significant balance sheet reduction reserve bal ances had remained elevated because the decline in usage of the on rrp facility had shifted federal reserve lia bilities toward reserves however with the extent of fu ture declines in on rrp takeup becoming more lim ited further balance sheet runoff will likely translate more directly into declines in reserve balances poten tially at a rapid pace in light of the uncertainty regarding the level of reserves consistent with operating in an am plereserves regime slowing the pace of balance sheet runoff sooner rather than later would help facilitate a smooth transition from abundant to ample reserve bal ances slower runoff would give the committee more time to assess market conditions as the balance sheet continues to shrink it would allow banks and short term funding markets more generally additional time to adjust to the lower level of reserves thus reducing the probability that money markets experience undue stress that could require an early end to runoff therefore the decision to slow the pace of runoff does not mean that the balance sheet will ultimately shrink by less than it would otherwise rather a slower pace of runoff would facilitate ongoing declines in securities holdings con sistent with reaching ample reserves a few participants however indicated that they preferred to continue with the current pace of balance sheet runoff until market in dicators begin to show signs that reserves are approach ing an ample level all participants emphasized the im portance of communicating that a decision to slow the pace of runoff would have no implications for the stance of monetary policy as it would mean implementing one of the transitional steps previously announced in the committees balance sheet plans in their discussions regarding how to adjust the pace of runoff participants generally favored reducing the monthly pace of runoff by roughly half from the recent overall pace with redemptions of agency debt and agency mortgagebacked securities mbs expected to continue to run well below the current monthly cap par ticipants saw little need to adjust this cap which also would be consistent with the committees intention to page federal open market committee hold primarily treasury securities in the longer run ac cordingly participants generally preferred to maintain the existing cap on agency mbs and adjust the redemp tion cap on us treasury securities to slow the pace of balance sheet runoff participants also shared their initial perspectives on longerterm aspects of balance sheet policy beyond the more immediate issues concerning slowing the pace of runoff although they saw the current level of reserves as abundant participants emphasized the underlying un certainty about the level of reserves consistent with op erating in an amplereserves regime they noted various price and quantity metrics that they saw as important realtime indicators of conditions in shortterm funding markets that could provide signals that reserves are ap proaching a level somewhat above ample some partic ipants also mentioned the importance of both the dis count window and the standing repo facility as liquidity backstops as reserves decline many participants com mented on aspects of the composition of the federal re serves securities holdings including the appropriate longerrun maturity composition of the system open market account portfolio and options to achieve in the longer run a portfolio that consists primarily of treasury securities staff review of the economic situation the information available at the time of the march meeting suggested that us real gross domestic prod uct gdp was expanding at a solid rate in the first quar ter although slower than its robust fourthquarter pace labor market conditions remained strong in recent months consumer price inflationas measured by the month change in the price index for personal con sumption expenditures pcecontinued to trend down though it remained above percent labor demand and supply appeared to continue to move into better balance although recent indicators were mixed total nonfarm payroll employment increased at a faster average monthly pace over january and february than in the fourth quarter in contrast the unemploy ment rate edged up to percent in february while the labor force participation rate and the employmentto population ratio were essentially unchanged the unem ployment rate for african americans increased and the rate for hispanics was unchanged both rates were higher than those for asians and for whites the pri vatesector job openings rate and the quits rate were little changed in january and both rates were far below their yearearlier levels the month change in average hourly earnings for all employees was essentially the same in february as it was at the end of last year and it remained well below its level a year ago the wage growth tracker constructed by the federal reserve bank of atlanta was lower over the past two months than readings last year consumer price inflation continued to decline but re cent progress was uneven total pce prices increased percent over the months ending in january while core pce price inflationwhich excludes changes in energy prices and many consumer food priceswas percent over the same period both of those month measures continued to trend down although the monthovermonth readings for january had moved up the trimmed mean measure of month pce price inflation constructed by the federal reserve bank of dallas was percent in january lower than its level a year earlier over the months ending in february the consumer price

components of the retail sales data used to estimate pce were soft in february januarys readings on orders and shipments of nonde fense capital goods excluding aircraft and on nonresi dential construction spending suggested some decelera tion in business fixed investment in contrast starts and permits for singlefamily homes in january and february pointed to a modest pickup in residential investment growth real exports of goods stepped down in january relative to december following rapid growth last quar ter by contrast real goods imports picked up in janu ary as higher imports of

more than exports which increased only slightly in contrast to strong us gdp growth in the fourth quarter economic growth in foreign economies was generally weak amid tight monetary policy the erosion

reflecting strong demand for leadingedge semiconductors foreign headline inflation picked up early in the year as the downward pressure from previous energy price de clines waned and some emerging

yields moved up over the period with larger increases concentrated at shorter maturities most of the increase in shortterm treasury yields was attributed to a rise in nearterm inflation compensation

corporate bonds were little changed and those on speculativegrade bonds nar rowed slightly the onemonth optionimplied volatility on the sp index increased slightly over the period but remained low by

had many borrowers with loans maturing last year not re ceived extensions cmbs delinquency rates for most other property types were stable at normaltolow levels partly because many of these borrowers were also able to extend their loans when they reached maturity last year the deterioration in cre credit quality sparked investor concerns about the health of a few small us and foreign banks over the intermeeting period staff economic outlook the economic projection prepared by the staff for the march meeting was stronger than the january forecast the upward revision in the forecast primarily reflected the staffs incorporation of a higher projected path for population due to a boost from immigration the lagged effects of earlier monetary policy actions through their continued contribution to tight financial and credit con ditions were still expected to hold output growth in below the staffs estimate of potential growth as those policy effects waned output was expected to rise in line with potential in and the unemploy ment rate was forecast to remain roughly flat over the next several years total and core pce price inflation were both projected to edge down in ending the year around per cent as demand and supply in product and labor mar kets continued to move into better balance by total and core pce price inflation were expected to be close to percent the staff viewed uncertainty around the baseline projec tion as close to the average over the past years as uncertainty was judged to have diminished substantially over the past year risks around the inflation forecast were seen as tilted slightly to the upside as supplyside disruptionsfrom developments domestically or abroador unexpectedly persistent inflation dynamics could materialize the risks around the forecast for eco nomic activity were viewed as skewed a little to the downside as any substantial setback in reducing infla tion might lead to a tightening of financial conditions that would slow the pace of economic activity by more than the staff anticipated in their baseline forecast participants views on current conditions and the economic outlook in conjunction with this fomc meeting participants submitted their projections of the most likely outcomes for real gdp growth the unemployment rate and infla tion for each year from through and over the longer run the projections were based on their individ ual assessments of appropriate monetary policy includ ing the path of the federal funds rate the longerrun projections represented each participants assessment of the rate to which each variable would be expected to converge over time under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy a summary of economic projections was released to the public following the conclusion of the meeting in their discussion of inflation participants observed that significant progress had been made over the past minutes of the meeting of march page year toward the committees percent inflation objec tive even though the two most recent monthly readings on core and headline inflation had been firmer than ex pected some participants noted that the recent in creases in inflation had been relatively broad based and therefore should not be discounted as merely statistical aberrations however a few participants noted that re sidual seasonality could have affected the inflation read ings at the start of the year participants generally com mented that they remained highly attentive to inflation risks but that they had also anticipated that there would be some unevenness in monthly inflation readings as in flation returned to target in their outlook for inflation participants noted that they continued to expect that inflation would return to percent over the medium term they remained con cerned that elevated inflation continued to harm house holds especially those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials like food housing and transportation a few participants remarked that they expected core non housing services inflation to decline as the labor market continued to move into better balance and wage growth moderated further participants discussed the still elevated rate of housing services inflation and com mented on the uncertainty regarding when and by how much lower readings for rent growth on new leases would pass through to this category of inflation several participants noted that the disinflationary pressure for core goods that had resulted from the receding of supply chain bottlenecks was likely to moderate other factors related to aggregate supply such as increases in the labor force or better productivity growth were viewed by sev eral participants as likely to support continued disinfla tion some participants reported that business contacts had indicated that they were less able to pass on price increases or that consumers were becoming more sensi tive to price changes some participants observed that longerterm inflation expectations appeared to remain well anchored as reflected in a broad range of surveys of households businesses and forecasters as well as measures from financial markets participants expected that economic growth would slow from last years strong pace with regard to the house hold sector participants noted that consumption spend ing generally remained solid although many commented that recent readings on retail sales had been soft several participants pointed to the strong labor market ongoing wage gains and a generally healthy householdsector bal ance sheet as likely to continue to support consumption participants noted mixed reports about the pace of homebuilding amid stillelevated financing costs for de velopers despite strong housing demand and a limited supply of affordable housing some participants noted that increased immigration which had likely been boost ing the growth of personal consumption spending may also have been adding to the demand for housing many participants pointed to indicators such as higher credit card balances greater use of buynowpaylater pro grams or rising delinquency rates on some types of con sumer loans as evidence that the finances of some lower and moderateincome households might be coming un der pressure these developments were seen by these participants as a downside risk to the outlook for con sumption spending reports from business contacts in some industries and districts conveyed increased optimism about the out look while contacts in a couple of other districts re ported only a steady or stable pace of economic activity restrictive credit conditions were cited by a few partici pants as restraining sectors such as equipment invest ment and residential investment however several par ticipants noted that their contacts had reported increased investment in technology or in business process im provements that were enhancing productive capacity and helping businesses ameliorate the effects of a tight labor market manufacturing activity was characterized as stable a couple of participants noted that high input costs and lower expected commodity prices were weigh ing on farm incomes participants assessed that demand and supply in the la bor market were continuing to come into better balance although conditions generally remained tight partici pants noted strong recent payroll growth while the un employment rate remained low participants cited a va riety of indicators that suggested some easing in labor market conditions including declining job vacancies a lower quits rate and a reduced ratio of job openings to unemployed workers some participants indicated that business contacts had reported less difficulty in hiring or retaining workers several participants noted that the better balance between labor supply and demand had contributed to an easing of nominal wage pressures nevertheless some participants observed that portions of the labor market such as the healthcare sector and in less urban areas remained very tight most partici pants noted that during the past year labor supply had been boosted by increased labor force participation as well as by immigration participants further commented that recent estimates of greater immigration in the past few years and an overall increase in labor supply could help explain the strength in employment gains even as page federal open market committee the unemployment rate had remained roughly flat and wage pressures had eased participants discussed the uncertainties around the eco nomic outlook participants generally noted their uncer tainty about the persistence of high inflation and ex pressed the view that recent data had not increased their confidence that inflation was moving sustainably down to percent some participants pointed to geopolitical risks that might result in more severe supply bottlenecks or higher shipping costs that could put upward pressure on prices and observed that those developments could also weigh on economic growth the possibility that ge opolitical events or surges in domestic demand could generate increased energy prices was also seen as an up side risk to inflation some participants noted the un certainties regarding the restrictiveness of financial con ditions and the associated risk that conditions were or could become less restrictive than desired which could add momentum to aggregate demand and put upward pressure on inflation several participants commented that increased efficiencies and technological innovations had the potential to raise productivity growth which might allow the economy to grow faster without raising inflation participants also noted downside risks to eco nomic activity including slowing economic growth in china a deterioration in conditions in domestic cre markets a potential reemergence of stresses in the bank ing sector or the possibility that a pickup in layoffs could result in a relatively rapid rise in unemployment many participants pointed to the difficulty in assessing how re cent immigration trends would influence the evolution of labor supply aggregate demand and overall eco nomic activity in their consideration of monetary policy at this meeting all participants judged that in light of current economic conditions the outlook for economic activity and infla tion and the balance of risks it was appropriate to main tain the target range for the federal funds rate at to percent participants also agreed that it was appro priate to continue the process of reducing the federal reserves securities holdings as described in the previ ously announced plans for reducing the size of the fed eral reserves balance sheet participants commented that maintaining the current target range for the federal funds rate at this meeting would support the commit tees progress to return inflation to the percent objec tive and keep longerterm inflation expectations well an chored in discussing the policy outlook participants judged that the policy rate was likely at its peak for this tightening cycle and almost all participants judged that it would be appropriate to move policy to a less restrictive stance at some point this year if the economy evolved broadly as they expected in support of this view they noted that the disinflation process was continuing along a path that was generally expected to be somewhat uneven they also pointed to the committees policy actions together with the ongoing improvements in supply conditions as factors working to move supply and demand into better balance participants noted indicators pointing to strong economic momentum and disappointing readings on in flation in recent months and commented that they did not expect it would be appropriate to reduce the target range for the federal funds rate until they had gained greater confidence that inflation was moving sustainably toward percent participants remarked that in consid ering any adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate at future meetings they would carefully assess incoming data the evolving outlook and the balance of risks participants noted the importance of continuing to communicate clearly the committees datadependent approach in formulating monetary policy and the strong commitment to achieve its dualmandate objectives of maximum employment and price stability in discussing riskmanagement considerations that could bear on the policy outlook participants generally judged that risks to the achievement of the committees employment and inflation goals were moving into better balance they remarked that it was important to weigh the risks of maintaining a restrictive stance for too long which could unduly weaken economic activity and em ployment against the risks of easing policy too quickly which could stall or even reverse progress in returning inflation to the committees percent inflation objec tive regarding the latter risk participants emphasized the importance of carefully assessing incoming data to judge whether inflation is moving down sustainably to percent participants noted various sources of uncer tainty associated with their outlooks for economic activ ity the labor market and inflation with some partici pants additionally mentioning uncertainty about the ex tent to which past monetary policy actions or the current stance of policy would weigh further on aggregate de mand participants agreed however that monetary pol icy remained well positioned to respond to evolving eco nomic conditions and risks to the outlook including the possibility of maintaining the current restrictive policy stance for longer should the disinflation process slow or reducing policy restraint in the event of an unexpected weakening in labor market conditions minutes of the meeting of march page committee policy actions in their discussions of monetary policy for this meeting members agreed that economic activity had been ex panding at a solid pace job gains had remained strong and the unemployment rate had remained low inflation had eased over the past year but remained elevated members

board page federal open market committee developments in financial markets and open market operations the manager turned first to a review of developments in financial markets domestic data releases over the inter meeting period pointed to inflation being more persis tent than previously expected and to a generally resilient economy policy expectations shifted materially in re sponse the policy rate path derived from futures prices implied fewer than two basis point rate cuts by year end the modal path based on options prices was quite flat suggesting at most one such rate cut in the median of the modal paths of the federal funds rate ob tained from the open market desks survey of primary dealers and survey of market participants also indicated fewer cuts this year than previously thought respond ents baseline expectations for the timing of the first rate cutwhich had been concentrated around june in the march surveysshifted out significantly and became more diffuse treasury yields rose materially over the intermeeting pe riod at shorter maturities the increase appeared to largely reflect higher inflation compensation while at longer maturities it was attributable mostly to a higher expected path for the real policy rate and higher real risk premiums model estimates suggested that inflation ex pectations rose some but mostly at shorter horizons longerterm inflation expectations appeared to remain well anchored broad equity prices fell over the period as higher interest rates weighed on valuations while re cent earnings reports which were generally solid pro vided some support the dollar strengthened as several foreign central banks were expected to start easing policy before the federal reserve overall higher yields and lower equity prices together with the stronger dollar re sulted in a tightening of financial conditions over the pe riod the manager then discussed expectations regarding bal ance sheet policy respondents to the desk surveys ex pected a slowing in the pace of balance sheet reduction to begin soon the median respondent projected that the slowdown would start in june one month earlier than in the march surveys the average probability distribution of the size of the system open market account soma portfolio at the end of runoff had become a bit more concentrated and its probabilityweighted mean was slightly lower than in the march surveys overall the survey results suggested that respondents expecta tions for a slowdown of balance sheet runoff had been decoupled from expectations about the timing and ex tent of rate cuts and that respondents understood that a slowdown in the pace of runoff was not likely to trans late to a higher terminal size of the portfolio the manager then turned to money markets and desk operations unsecured overnight rates were stable over the intermeeting period in secured funding markets rates on overnight repurchase agreements firmed some what over the march quarterend reporting date in line with recent history market participants generally re ported that the return of somewhat higher rates around reporting dates had not been associated with any issues in market functioning despite the ongoing balance sheet runoff takeup at the overnight reverse repurchase agreement on rrp facility was largely steady over the period likely reflecting fewer attractive privatemarket alternatives for money market funds mmfs amid a re cent reduction in treasury bills outstanding as well as a decrease in mmfs weighted average maturities on rrp usage was also likely supported by typical monthend dynamics the staff and respondents to the desks survey of primary dealers expected on rrp takeup to decline in coming months the manager provided an update on reserve conditions over the intermeeting period the federal funds market continued to be insensitive to daytoday changes in the supply of reserves and suggested that reserves remained abundant the manager discussed various other indica tors that supported the same conclusion the committee voted unanimously to renew the recip rocal currency arrangements with the bank of canada and the bank of mexico these arrangements are associ ated with the federal reserves participation in the north american framework agreement of in ad dition the committee voted unanimously to renew the dollar and foreign currency liquidity swap arrangements with the bank of canada the bank of england the bank of japan the european central bank and the swiss na tional bank the votes to renew the federal reserves participation in these standing arrangements occur an nually at the april or may fomc meeting by unanimous vote the committee ratified the desks domestic transactions over the intermeeting period there were no intervention operations in foreign curren cies for the systems account during the intermeeting pe riod staff review of the economic situation the information available at the time of the april may meeting indicated that growth in us real gross domestic product gdp stepped down in the first quar ter of from the robust pace seen over the second minutes of the meeting of april may page half of labor market conditions remained strong consumer price inflationas measured by the month change in the price index for personal con sumption expenditures pceslowed significantly over the past year but had moved up slightly in recent months

increased at a faster average monthly pace in the first quarter of than in the fourth quarter of the unemployment rate ticked down to per cent in march while the labor force participation rate and the employmenttopopulation ratio both moved up percentage point the unemployment rate for afri can americans increased and the rate for hispanics moved down both rates were higher than those for asians and for whites the month changes in the employment cost index eci and average hourly earn ings for all employees both declined in march relative to a year earlier but the month change in the eci stepped up noticeably from the average pace that pre vailed over the second half of regarding consumer price inflation total pce prices in creased percent over the months ending in march while core

and services grew at a tepid pace overall in the first quarter with gains in exports of foods consumer goods and capital goods being mostly offset by declines in exports of industrial supplies by

quarter foreign gdp growth is estimated to have picked up in the first quarter from its subdued pace in the previous quarter in europe economic activity resumed expand ing following modest contractions in several economies amid monetary policy restraint and the repercussions of the energy shock growth stepped up in china led by strong exports but propertysector indicators re mained weak elsewhere in emerging asia exports re bounded further from last years lows lifted by robust global demand for hightech goods headline inflation eased modestly further in the ad vanced foreign economies afes in the first quarter but inched up in the emerging market economies in part because of food price pressure caused by adverse weather in some countries most major afe central banks kept their policy rates unchanged over the inter meeting period and some reiterated that policy rate cuts could be appropriate at coming meetings staff review of the financial situation over the intermeeting period the marketimplied path for the federal funds rate through increased mark edly and federal funds futures rates suggested that mar ket participants were placing lower odds on significant policy easing in than they did just before the march fomc meeting consistent with the rise in the implied policy path nominal treasury yields at all maturities also rose substantially as

standards over the past two years in the april senior loan officer opin ion survey on bank lending practices sloos large banks kept standards and most lending terms for ci loans unchanged on net while smaller banks con tinued to tighten standards and terms on net banks reported tightening standards further in the april sloos for all loan categories of commercial real estate cre loans the growth of bank cre loan balances slowed notably over the past year reflecting the tighten ing of credit standards over this period though growth of cre loan balances picked up modestly in the first quarter credit remained available for most consumers despite some signs of recent tightening for residential real es tate borrowers conforming and governmentbacked loans remained generally available credit card balances continued to grow at a robust pace though a significant net share of sloos respondents indicated that lending standards for credit cards tightened further in the first quarter growth in auto lending moderated in january and february and a modest net share of banks reported in the sloos that they tightened lending standards on auto loans in the first quarter although credit quality for household loans remained solid on balance delinquency rates for credit cards and auto loans in the fourth quarter remained notably above their levels just before the pandemic for residential mortgages delinquency rates across loan types were largely unchanged in february the credit quality of nonfinancial firms borrowing in the corporate bond and leveraged loan markets remained stable overall the av erage delinquency rate for loans in cmbs pools ticked down in march but remained at elevated levels mean while the share of nonperforming cre loans at banksdefined as loans past due days or in nonac crual statusrose further through march especially for loans secured by office buildings the staff provided an update on its assessment of the stability of the us financial system on balance the staff continued to characterize the systems financial vul nerabilities as notable but raised the assessment of vul nerabilities in asset valuations to elevated as valuations across a range of markets appeared high relative to risk adjusted cash flows house prices remained elevated rel ative to fundamentals such as rents and treasury yields though the fraction of mortgage borrowers with small equity positions remained low cre prices continued to decline especially in the multifamily and office sectors and vacancy rates in these sectors remained elevated vulnerabilities associated with business and household debt were characterized as moderate nonfinancial busi ness leverage was high but the ability of firms to service their debt remained solid partly due to robust earnings leverage in the financial sector was characterized as no table regulatory capital ratios in the banking sector re mained high however the fair value of bank assets was estimated to have fallen further in the first quarter re flecting the substantial duration risk on bank balance sheets for the nonbank sector the prevalence of the basis trade by hedge funds appeared to have declined from its peak but remained elevated by historical stand ards funding risks were also characterized as notable assets in prime mmfs and other cash management vehicles continued to grow steadily the staff assessed that the financial stability risks associated with the fastgrowing private credit sector were limited so far because of the modest leverage used by private debt funds and business development companies and the limited maturity mis match present in their funding vehicles however the staff also noted the growing connections between minutes of the meeting of april may page private credit and the banking sector the growth of some forms of private credit and the fact that the private credit market has yet to experience a severe credit down turn staff economic outlook the economic forecast prepared by the staff for the aprilmay meeting was similar to the march projection the economy was expected to maintain its high rate of resource utilization over the next few years with pro jected output growth roughly similar to the staffs esti mate of potential growth the unemployment rate was expected to edge down slightly over as labor mar ket functioning improved further and to remain roughly steady thereafter total and core pce price inflation were both projected to move lower this year relative to last year though the expected pace of disinflation was slower than in the march projection as incoming data pointed to more per sistence in inflation in coming months inflation was expected to decline further beyond this year as demand and supply in product and labor markets continued to move into better balance by total and core pce price inflation were expected to be close to percent the staff continued to view the uncertainty around the baseline projection as close to the average over the past years risks to the inflation forecast were seen as tilted to the upside reflecting the possibility that supply side disruptions or unexpectedly persistent inflation dy namics could materialize the risks around the forecast for economic activity were seen as skewed to the down side on the grounds that morepersistent inflation could result in tighter financial conditions than in the staffs baseline projection in addition deteriorating household financial positions especially for lowerincome house holds might prove to be a larger drag on activity than the staff anticipated participants views on current conditions and the economic outlook participants observed that while inflation had eased over the past year in recent months there had been a lack of further progress toward the committees percent ob jective the recent monthly data had showed significant increases in components of both goods and services price inflation in particular inflation for core services excluding housing had moved up in the first quarter compared with the fourth quarter of last year and prices of core goods posted their first threemonth increase in several months in addition housing services inflation had slowed less than had been anticipated based on the smaller increases in measures of market rents over the past year a few participants remarked that unusually large seasonal patterns could have contributed to janu arys large increase in pce inflation and several partici pants noted that some components that typically display volatile price changes had boosted recent readings however some participants emphasized that the recent increases in inflation had been relatively broad based and therefore should not be overly discounted participants generally commented that they remained highly attentive to inflation risks they also remained concerned that elevated inflation continued to harm the purchasing power of households especially those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials like food housing and transportation participants noted that they continued to expect that in flation would return to percent over the medium term however recent data had not increased their confidence in progress toward percent and accordingly had sug gested that the disinflation process would likely take longer than previously thought participants discussed several factors that in conjunction with appropriately re strictive monetary policy could support the return of in flation to the committees goal over time one was a further reduction in housing services price inflation as lower readings for rent growth on new leases continued to pass through to this category of inflation however many participants commented that the passthrough would likely take place only gradually or noted that a re acceleration of market rents could reduce the effect several participants stated that core nonhousing services price inflation could resume its decline as wage growth slows further with labor demand and supply moving into better balance aided by higher labor force participation and strong immigration flows in addition many partic ipants commented that ongoing increases in productivity growth would support disinflation if sustained though the outlook for productivity growth was regarded as un certain several participants said that business contacts in their districts reported increased difficulty in raising their output prices while a few participants reported a continued ability of firms in their districts to pass on higher costs to consumers although some measures of shortterm inflation expectations from surveys of con sumers had increased in recent months medium and longerterm measures of expected inflation had re mained well anchored which was seen as crucial for meeting the committees inflation goal on a sustained basis while supply chain improvements had supported disinflation for goods prices over the previous year par ticipants commented that an expected more gradual pace of such improvements could slow progress on page federal open market committee inflation several participants commented that growth of aggregate demand would likely have to slow from its strong pace in recent quarters for inflation to move sus tainably toward the committees goal participants assessed that demand and supply in the la bor market on net were continuing to come into better balance though at a slower rate nevertheless they saw conditions as having generally remained tight amid re cent strong payroll growth and a stilllow unemployment rate participants cited a variety of indicators that sug gested some easing in labor market tightness including declining job vacancies a lower quits rate and a reduced ratio of job openings to unemployed workers some participants indicated that business contacts had re ported less difficulty in hiring or retaining workers al though contacts in several districts continued to report tight labor conditions especially in the health care and construction sectors many participants commented that the better balance between labor demand and sup ply had contributed to an easing of nominal wage pres sures even so a number of participants noted that some measures of labor cost growth including the eci had not eased in recent months and a couple of participants remarked that negotiated compensation agreements had added to wage pressures in their districts many partic ipants noted that during the past year labor supply had been boosted by increased labor force participation rates as well as by immigration participants further com mented that recent estimates of greater immigration in the past few years and an overall increase in labor supply could help explain the strength in employment gains even as the unemployment rate had remained roughly flat and wage pressures had eased participants noted that recent indicators suggested that economic activity had continued to expand at a solid pace real gdp growth in the first quarter had moder ated relative to the second half of last year but pdfp growth maintained a strong pace high interest rates appeared to weigh on consumer durables purchases in the first quarter and growth of business fixed invest ment remained modest despite the high interest rates residential investment grew more strongly in the first quarter than its modest pace in the second half of last year although recent pdfp data suggested continued strong economic momentum participants generally did not in terpret the data as indicating a further acceleration of ac tivity and expected that gdp growth would slow from last years strong pace a number of participants com mented that high rates of immigration could support economic activity by boosting labor supply and contrib uting to aggregate demand participants noted the im portant influence of productivity growth for the eco nomic outlook some participants suggested that the re cent increase in productivity growth might not persist because it reflected onetime adjustments to the level of productivity or reflected continued elevated volatility in the data over the past several years a few participants commented that higher productivity growth might be sustained by the incorporation of technologies such as artificial intelligence into existing business operations or by high rates of new business formation in the technol ogy sector in their discussion of the outlook for the household sec tor participants observed that consumer spending re mained firm in the first quarter supported by low unem ployment and solid income growth a number of par ticipants judged that consumption growth was likely to moderate this year as growth in labor income was ex pected to slow and the financial positions of many households were expected to weaken many participants noted signs that the finances of low and moderatein come households were increasingly coming under pres sure which these participants saw as a downside risk to the outlook for consumption they pointed to increased usage of credit cards and buynowpaylater services as well as increased delinquency rates for some types of consumer loans in addition elevated housing costs were adding to financial strains for lowerincome house holds a couple of participants noted that financial con ditions appeared favorable for wealthier households which account for a large portion of aggregate consump tion with hefty wealth gains resulting from recent equity and house price increases business contacts in many districts reported a steady or stable pace of economic activity while contacts in a cou ple of districts conveyed increased optimism about the outlook a few participants noted that government spending was supporting business expansion in their districts consistent with a solid outlook for businesses a couple of participants noted that their contacts had re ported increased investment in technology or in business process improvements that were enhancing productive capacity regarding the agricultural sector a couple of participants noted that lower commodity prices were weighing on farm incomes participants discussed the risks and uncertainties around the economic outlook they generally noted their un certainty about the persistence of inflation and agreed that recent data had not increased their confidence that minutes of the meeting of april may page inflation was moving sustainably toward percent some participants pointed to geopolitical events or other factors resulting in more severe supply bottlenecks or higher shipping costs which could put upward pressure on prices and weigh on economic growth the possibil ity that geopolitical events could generate commodity price increases was also seen as an upside risk to infla tion a number of participants noted uncertainty regard ing the degree of restrictiveness of current financial con ditions and the associated risk that such conditions were insufficiently restrictive on aggregate demand and infla tion several participants commented that increased ef ficiencies and technological innovations could raise productivity growth on a sustained basis which might allow the economy to grow faster without raising infla tion participants also noted downside risks to economic activity including slowing economic growth in china a deterioration in conditions in domestic cre markets or a sharp tightening in financial conditions in their discussion of financial stability participants who commented noted vulnerabilities to the financial system that they assessed warranted monitoring participants discussed a range of risks emanating from the banking sector including unrealized losses on assets resulting from the rise in longerterm yields high cre exposure significant reliance by some banks on uninsured depos its cyber threats or increased financial interconnections among banks several participants commented on the rapid growth of private credit markets noting that such developments should be monitored because the sector was becoming more interconnected with other parts of the financial system and that some associated risks may not yet be apparent a few participants also commented on the importance of measures aimed at increasing resil ience in the treasury market such as central clearing or on potential vulnerabilities posed by leveraged investors in the treasury market a couple of participants com mented that the federal reserve should continue to im prove the operational efficiency of the discount window participants generally noted that high interest rates could contribute to vulnerabilities in the financial system in that context a number of participants emphasized that monetary policy should be guided by the outlook for em ployment and inflation and that other tools should be the primary means to address financial stability risks in their consideration of monetary policy at this meeting all participants judged that in light of current economic conditions and their implications for the outlook for em ployment and inflation as well as the balance of risks it was appropriate to maintain the target range for the fed eral funds rate at to percent participants assessed that maintaining the current target range for the federal funds rate at this meeting was supported by in termeeting data indicating continued solid economic growth and a lack of further progress toward the com mittees percent inflation objective in recent months participants also discussed the process of reducing the federal reserves securities holdings participants judged that balance sheet reduction had proceeded smoothly almost all participants expressed support for the decision to begin to slow the pace of decline of the federal reserves securities holdings in june by reducing the monthly redemption cap on treasury securities from billion to billion maintaining the monthly re demption cap on agency debt and agency mort gagebacked securities mbs at billion and rein vesting any principal payments in excess of the bil lion cap into treasury securities a few participants in dicated that they could have supported a continuation of the current pace of balance sheet runoff at this time or a slightly higher redemption cap on treasury securities than was decided upon various participants empha sized that the decision to slow the pace of runoff does not have implications for the stance of monetary policy several participants also emphasized that slowing the pace of balance sheet runoff did not mean that the bal ance sheet would ultimately shrink by less than it would otherwise some participants commented that slowing the pace of balance sheet runoff would help facilitate a smooth transition from abundant to ample reserve bal ances by reducing the likelihood that money markets ex perience undue stress that could require an early end to runoff participants generally assessed that it would be important to continue to monitor indicators of reserve conditions as balance sheet runoff continued in addi tion a few participants commented that the existing re demption cap on agency debt and agency mbs was un likely to bind at any point over the coming years but the decision to reinvest any principal payments above that cap into treasury securities was consistent with the committees longerrun intention to hold a portfolio that consists primarily of treasury securities a couple of participants commented that it would be useful to begin discussions regarding the appropriate longerrun maturity composition of the soma portfolio in discussing the policy outlook participants remarked that the future path of the policy rate would depend on incoming data the evolving outlook and the balance of risks many participants commented that the public ap peared to have a good understanding of the committees datadependent approach in formulating monetary pol icy and its commitment to achieving its dualmandate page federal open market committee goals of maximum employment and price stability var ious participants also emphasized the importance of continuing to communicate this message participants noted disappointing readings on inflation over the first quarter and indicators pointing to strong economic mo mentum and assessed that it would take longer than pre viously anticipated for them to gain greater confidence that inflation was moving sustainably toward percent in discussing riskmanagement considerations that could bear on the policy outlook participants generally assessed that risks to the achievement of the commit tees employment and inflation goals had moved toward better balance over the past year participants remained highly attentive to inflation risks and noted the uncer tainty associated with the economic outlook although monetary policy was seen as restrictive many partici pants commented on their uncertainty about the degree of restrictiveness these participants saw this uncer tainty as coming from the possibility that high interest rates may be having smaller effects than in the past that longerrun equilibrium interest rates may be higher than previously thought or that the level of potential output may be lower than estimated participants assessed however that monetary policy remained well positioned to respond to evolving economic conditions and risks to the outlook participants discussed maintaining the cur rent restrictive policy stance for longer should inflation not show signs of moving sustainably toward percent or reducing policy restraint in the event of an unexpected weakening in labor market conditions various partici pants mentioned a willingness to tighten policy further should risks to inflation materialize in a way that such an action became appropriate committee policy actions in their discussions of monetary policy for this meeting members agreed that economic activity continued to ex pand at a solid pace job gains remained strong and the unemployment rate remained low inflation eased over the past year but remained elevated members also con curred that in recent months there was a lack of further progress toward the committees percent inflation ob jective and agreed to acknowledge this development in the postmeeting statement members judged that the risks to achieving the committees employment and in flation goals had moved toward better balance over the past year members viewed the economic outlook as un certain and agreed that they remained highly attentive to inflation risks in support of the committees goals to achieve maxi mum employment and inflation at the rate of percent over the longer run members agreed to maintain the tar get range for the federal funds rate at to percent members concurred that in considering any adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate they would carefully assess incoming data the evolving outlook and the balance of risks members agreed that they did not expect that it would be appropriate to reduce the target range until they have gained greater confidence that in flation is moving sustainably toward percent in addi tion members agreed to continue to reduce the federal reserves holdings of treasury securities and agency debt and agency mbs members decided that beginning in june the committee would slow the pace of decline of its securities holdings by reducing the monthly re demption cap on treasury securities from billion to billion in addition members decided that the com mittee would maintain the monthly redemption cap on agency debt and agency mbs at billion and begin ning in june would reinvest any principal payments in excess of this cap into treasury securities all members affirmed their strong commitment to returning inflation to the committees percent objective members agreed that in assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy they would continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook they would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerged that could impede the attainment of the committees goals members also agreed that their assessments would take into account a wide range of information including readings on labor market conditions inflation pressures and inflation expectations and financial and interna tional developments at the conclusion of the discussion the committee voted to direct the federal reserve bank of new york until instructed otherwise to execute transactions in the soma in accordance with the following domestic policy directive for release at pm effective may the federal open mar ket committee directs the desk to undertake open market operations as nec essary to maintain the federal funds rate in a target

developments in financial markets and open market operations the manager turned first to a review of developments in financial markets financial conditions eased modestly over the intermeeting period mainly because of higher equity prices taking a somewhat longer perspective the manager noted that financial conditions had changed little since march but eased notably since the fall the main drivers of that easing were again higher equity prices which appeared to respond to the reductions in the perceived odds of a recession and a consensus among market participants that the federal funds rate has reached its peak nominal treasury yields declined moderately across the curve on net but continued to be very sensitive to incoming data surprises especially those pertaining to inflation and the labor market the net decline in nominal yields over the period was primar ily due to lower real yields inflation compensation also fell somewhat especially at shorter horizons longer term inflation expectations remained well anchored the manager turned next to policy rate expectations the path of the federal funds rate implied by futures prices shifted a bit lower over the intermeeting period and indicated one and onehalf basis point cuts by yearend this shift appeared to reflect mostly changes in perceived risks rather than basecase expectations be cause the modal path implied by options was virtually unchanged and remained consistent with at most one cut this year the median of modal paths of the federal funds rate obtained from the open market desks sur vey of primary dealers and survey of market partici pantstaken before the may employment reportwas also little changed the manager then discussed expectations regarding bal ance sheet policy responses to the desk surveys showed a median expected timing for the end of balance sheet runoff of april one month later than in the previous surveys though individual respondents views of the exact timing remained dispersed respondents expectations about the size of the portfolio at the end of runoff had changed little in recent surveys in international developments the european central bank ecb and the bank of canada boc initiated ratecutting cycles this period as generally expected market participants reportedly had not expected easing cycles to begin at the same time across economies but appeared to expect that most advancedeconomy central banks will have started easing policy within the next sev eral months the manager then turned to money markets and desk operations unsecured overnight rates were stable over the intermeeting period in secured funding markets re purchase agreement repo rates remained steady for most of the period but firmed close to the end of may because of monthend pressures and the effect of large settlements of treasury coupon securities rate firm ness around reporting and settlement dates was con sistent with historical patterns use of the overnight re verse repurchase agreement on rrp facility remained sensitive to market rates and the availability of alterna tive investments usage was little changed over much of the period but dipped late in the period coincident with the monthend firming in private repo rates the staff projected on rrp usage to decline in coming months as net treasury bill issuance was expected to turn posi tive and private repo rates were expected to continue to move higher relative to administered rates amid large is suance of treasury coupon securities the staff also projected that reserves will not change much in the near term with the exception of quarterend dates and then will decline about in line with the shrinking of the fed eral reserves portfolio after on rrp balances are nearly fully drained the uncertainty surrounding both projections however was considerable the manager also discussed the responses to a desk sur vey question about the most likely spread between the effective federal funds rate and the interest rate on re serve balances at different levels of the sum of reserves and on rrp balances the responses indicated consid erable uncertainty and dispersion of views about when and how the spread would move as the sum declines the manager observed that indicators based on market prices and activity were likely the best gauges of how quickly reserves are transitioning from abundant to am ple over the intermeeting period the federal funds market continued to be insensitive to daytoday changes in the supply of reserves various other indicators sug gested that reserves remained abundant and that the risk of money market strains in the near term was low by unanimous vote the committee ratified the desks domestic transactions over the intermeeting period there were no intervention operations in foreign curren cies for the systems account during the intermeeting pe riod staff review of the economic situation the information available at the time of the meeting sug gested that us economic activity had expanded at a solid pace so far this year labor market conditions re mained solid job gains continued to be strong while the unemployment rate had edged up but was still low consumer price inflation was running well below where it was a year earlier but further progress toward the minutes of the meeting of june page committees percent inflation objective had been modest in recent months consumer price inflationas measured by the month change in the price index for personal con sumption expenditures pcewas about the same in april as at the end of last year although recent month overmonth readings of pce prices were lower than ear lier this year total pce price inflation was percent in april and core pce price inflationwhich excludes changes in energy prices and many consumer food priceswas percent the consumer price index cpi in may showed that the month change measure of total cpi inflation was percent and core cpi in flation was percent and recent monthly cpi readings were lower than earlier this year although some survey based measures of shortterm inflation expectations had moved up longerterm expectations were little changed and stood at levels consistent with those that prevailed just before the pandemic labor demand and supply continued to move into better balance total nonfarm payroll employment increased at only a somewhat slower average monthly pace over april and may than the strong rate recorded in the first quarter the recently released fourthquarter data from the quarterly census of employment and wages sug gested that while the strong reported rate of payroll in creases last year may have been overstated job gains were still solid in may the unemployment rate ticked up further to percent while the labor force partici pation rate and the employmenttopopulation ratio both moved down a little the unemployment rates for african americans and for hispanics were somewhat higher in may than in the first quarter both rates were above those for asians and for whites the ratio of job vacancies to unemployment declined further to in may about the same as its prepandemic level most measures of the increase in nominal wages from a year earlier continued to trend down including the month change in average hourly earnings for all employees which was percent in may percentage point lower than at the end of last year real gross domestic product gdp rose modestly in the first quarter held down by significant negative contribu tions from inventory investment and net exports which tend to be volatile components in contrast private do mestic final purchases pdfpwhich comprises pce and private fixed investment and which often provides a better signal than gdp of underlying economic momen tumincreased at a solid pace similar to last year re cent spending indicators suggested that gdp and pdfp were increasing at solid rates in the second quarter real exports of goods edged up in april relative to march following tepid growth in the first quarter real imports of goods jumped in april driven by higher im ports of autos and capital goods overall the nominal us international trade deficit widened in april as im ports of goods and services rose more than exports foreign gdp growth firmed in the first quarter a buoyant service sector helped europe recover from a modest contraction in the second half of last year in emerging market economies emes including china growth was supported by strong external demand the firstquarter surge in economic activity in china was also boosted by policy support especially from fiscal policy more recent chinese data however especially a steep drop in lending to households and businesses in april pointed to a considerable slowdown in chinas eco nomic activity in this quarter headline inflation continued to ease in the advanced for eign economies afes through may albeit at a slower pace than last year while core inflation had slowed sig nificantly the core nonhousing services component re mained elevated in several regions partly reflecting strong nominal wage growth inflation inched up in emes in part because of weatherrelated increases in food prices in some countries the riksbank the boc and the ecb cut their policy rates as market participants expected amid easing inflation communications about future policy decisions varied and were focused on do mestic economic conditions staff review of the financial situation over the intermeeting period the marketimplied path for the federal funds rate beyond the next few months edged down options on interest rate futures suggested that market participants were placing higher odds on policy easing by early than they did just before the april fomc meeting consistent with the slight down ward shift in the implied policy path nominal treasury yields at all maturities also moved down moderately driven primarily by declines in real treasury yields in flation compensation also fell some with larger

levels since driven by the office hotel and retail sectors and the credit quality of cre borrowers at banks weakened slightly further in the first quarter staff economic outlook the economic forecast prepared by the staff for the june meeting was similar to the projection at the time of the previous meeting the economy was expected to main tain a high rate of resource utilization over the next few years with real gdp growth projected to be roughly similar to the staffs estimate of potential output growth the unemployment rate was expected to edge down slightly over the remainder of this year and the next and then to remain roughly flat in total and core pce price inflation were both projected to be lower at the end of this year than they were at the end of last year the staffs inflation projections for this yearwhich included a preliminary reaction to the may cpi datawere little changed on balance from the in flation forecast at the time of the previous meeting the inflation forecast was higher however than at the time of the march meeting and the march summary of minutes of the meeting of june page economic projections sep submissions inflation was still expected to decline further in and as de mand and supply in product and labor markets contin ued to move into better balance by total and core pce price inflation were expected to be close to per cent the staff continued to view the uncertainty around the baseline projection as close to the average over the past years risks to the inflation forecast were seen as tilted to the upside reflecting the possibility that more persistent inflation dynamics or supplyside disruptions could unexpectedly materialize the risks around the forecast for economic activity were seen as skewed to the downside on the grounds that morepersistent infla tion could result in tighter financial conditions than in the staffs baseline projection in addition deteriorating household financial positions especially for lower income households might prove to have a larger nega tive effect on economic activity than the staff antici pated participants views on current conditions and the economic outlook in conjunction with this fomc meeting participants submitted their projections of the most likely outcomes for real gdp growth the unemployment rate and infla tion for each year from through and over the longer run these projections were based on their indi vidual assessments of appropriate monetary policy in cluding their projections of the federal funds rate the longerrun projections represented each participants as sessment of the rate to which each variable would tend to converge under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy the sep was released to the public after the meeting in their discussion of inflation developments partici pants noted that after a significant decline in inflation during the second half of the early part of this year had seen a lack of further progress toward the commit tees percent objective participants judged that al though inflation remained elevated there had been mod est further progress toward the percent goal in recent months participants observed that some of this pro gress was evident in the smaller monthly change in the core pce price index and a lower trimmed mean infla tion rate for april with the may cpi reading providing additional evidence recent data had also indicated im provements across a range of price categories including marketbased services some participants commented that sustained achievement of the percent inflation ob jective would be aided by lower overall services price in flation and some noted that shelter price inflation had so far been slow to come down a few participants also highlighted the strong increases recorded this year in core import prices nevertheless participants suggested that a number of developments in the product and labor markets supported their judgment that price pressures were diminishing in particular a few participants em phasized that nominal wage growth though still above rates consistent with price stability had declined notably in laborintensive sectors a few participants also noted reports that various retailers had cut prices and offered discounts participants further indicated that business contacts reported that their pricing power had declined participants suggested that evidence of firms reduced pricing power reflected increased customer resistance to price increases slower growth in economic activity and a reassessment by businesses of prospective economic conditions with regard to the outlook for inflation participants em phasized that they were strongly committed to their percent objective and that they remained concerned that elevated inflation continued to harm the purchasing power of households especially those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials like food housing and transportation participants highlighted a variety of fac tors that were likely to help contribute to continued dis inflation in the period ahead the factors included con tinued easing of demandsupply pressures in product and labor markets lagged effects on wages and prices of past monetary policy tightening the delayed response of measured shelter prices to rental market developments or the prospect of additional supplyside improvements the latter prospect included the possibility of a boost to productivity associated with businesses deployment of artificial intelligencerelated technology participants observed that longerterm inflation expectations had re mained well anchored and viewed this anchoring as un derpinning the disinflation process participants af firmed that additional favorable data were required to give them greater confidence that inflation was moving sustainably toward percent participants remarked that demand and supply in the la bor market had continued to come into better balance participants observed that many labor market indicators pointed to a reduced degree of tightness in labor market conditions these included a declining job openings rate a lower quits rate increases in parttime employ ment for economic reasons a lower hiring rate a further stepdown in the ratio of job vacancies to unemployed workers and a gradual uptick in the unemployment rate in addition a few participants indicated that business contacts were reporting less difficulty in hiring and re taining workers although contacts in several districts continued to report tight labor market conditions in page federal open market committee certain sectors such as health care construction or spe cialty manufacturing many participants noted that labor supply had been boosted by increased labor force partic ipation rates as well as by immigration a few partici pants noted that it was unlikely that immigration would continue at the pace seen in recent years however sev eral participants judged that with recent immigrants gradually becoming part of the workforce past immigra tion likely would continue to add to labor supply a few participants observed that increases in labor force par ticipation would likely now be limited and so would not be a major source of additional labor supply in consid ering recent payrolls data some participants observed that although increases in payrolls had continued to be strong the monthly increase in employment consistent with labor market equilibrium might now be higher than in the past because of immigration several participants also suggested that the establishment survey may have overstated actual job gains several participants re marked that a variety of indicators including wage gains for job switchers suggested that nominal wage growth was slowing consistent with easing labor market pres sures a number of participants noted that although the labor market remained strong the ratio of vacancies to unemployment had returned to prepandemic levels and there was some risk that further cooling in labor market conditions could be associated with an increased pace of layoffs some participants observed that with the risks to the committees dualmandate goals having now come into better balance labor market conditions would need careful monitoring participants generally ob served that continued labor market strength could be consistent with the committee achieving both its em ployment and inflation goals though they noted that some further gradual cooling in the labor market may be required participants noted that recent indicators suggested that economic activity had continued to expand at a solid pace participants expected that real gdp growth this year would be below the strong pace recorded in and they remarked that recent data on economic activity were largely consistent with the anticipated slowing participants observed that a lower rate of output growth this year could aid the disinflation process while also be ing consistent with a strong labor market participants generally viewed the committees restrictive monetary policy stance as having a restraining effect on growth in consumption and investment spending and as contrib uting to a gradual slowing in the pace of economic activ ity a couple of participants particularly stressed that the committees past policy tightening had contributed to higher rates for home mortgage loans and other longer term borrowing which were moderating spending and production including households discretionary pur chases and residential construction activity a few par ticipants remarked that spending by some higherin come households was likely being bolstered by increas ing asset prices many participants observed that in contrast lower and moderateincome households were encountering increasing strains as they attempted to meet higher living costs after having largely run down savings accumulated during the pandemic these partic ipants noted that such strains which were evident in ris ing credit card utilization and delinquency rates as well as motor vehicle loan delinquencies were a significant concern participants continued to assess that the risks to achiev ing their employment and inflation goals had moved to ward better balance over the past year participants cited a number of downside risks to economic activity includ ing those associated with a sharperthananticipated slowing in aggregate demand alongside a marked deteri oration in labor market conditions or with strains on lower and moderateincome households budgets lead ing to an abrupt curtailment of consumer spending a few participants pointed to downside risks to economic activity associated with the fragility of some parts of the cre sector or the vulnerable balance sheet positions of some banks some participants highlighted reasons why inflation could remain above percent for longer than expected these participants pointed to risks that infla tion could stay elevated as a result of worsening geopo litical developments heightened trade tensions more persistent shelter price inflation financial conditions that might be or could become insufficiently restrictive or us fiscal policy becoming more expansionary than expected the latter two scenarios were also seen as im plying upside risks to economic activity several partici pants also cited the risk of an unanchoring of longer term inflation expectations in their consideration of monetary policy at this meeting participants observed that incoming data indicated con tinued solid growth in economic activity and a strong la bor market while also pointing to modest further pro gress toward the committees percent inflation objec tive in recent months participants remained highly at tentive to inflation risks all participants judged that in light of current economic conditions and their implica tions for the outlook for employment and inflation as well as the balance of risks it was appropriate to main tain the target range for the federal funds rate at to percent participants furthermore judged that it was appropriate to continue the process of reducing the fed eral reserves securities holdings minutes of the meeting of june page in discussing the outlook for monetary policy partici pants noted that progress in reducing inflation had been slower this year than they had expected last december they emphasized that they did not expect that it would be appropriate to lower the target range for the federal funds rate until additional information had emerged to give them greater confidence that inflation was moving sustainably toward the committees percent objective in discussing their individual outlooks for the target range for the federal funds rate participants emphasized the importance of conditioning future policy decisions on incoming data the evolving economic outlook and the balance of risks several participants noted that fi nancial market reactions to data and feedback received from contacts suggested that the committees policy ap proach was generally well understood some partici pants suggested that further clarity about the fomcs reaction function might be provided by communications that emphasized the committees datadependent ap proach with monetary policy decisions being condi tional on the evolution of the economy rather than being on a preset path a couple of participants remarked that providing more information about the committees views on the economic outlook and the risks around the outlook would improve the publics understanding of the committees decisions in discussing riskmanagement considerations that could bear on the outlook for monetary policy partici pants assessed that with labor market tightness having eased and inflation having declined over the past year the risks to achieving the committees employment and inflation goals had moved toward better balance leaving monetary policy well positioned to deal with the risks and uncertainties faced in pursuing both sides of the committees dual mandate the vast majority of partic ipants assessed that growth in economic activity ap peared to be gradually cooling and most participants re marked that they viewed the current policy stance as re strictive some participants noted that there was uncer tainty about the degree of restrictiveness of current pol icy some remarked that the continued strength of the economy as well as other factors could mean that the longerrun equilibrium interest rate was higher than pre viously assessed in which case both the stance of mon etary policy and overall financial conditions may be less restrictive than they might appear a couple of partici pants noted that the longerrun equilibrium interest rate was a better guide for determining where the federal funds rate may need to move over the longer run than for assessing the restrictiveness of current policy par ticipants noted the uncertainty associated with the eco nomic outlook and with how long it would be appropri ate to maintain a restrictive policy stance some participants emphasized the need for patience in allow ing the committees restrictive policy stance to restrain aggregate demand and further moderate inflation pres sures several participants observed that were inflation to persist at an elevated level or to increase further the target range for the federal funds rate might need to be raised a number of participants remarked that mone tary policy should stand ready to respond to unexpected economic weakness several participants specifically emphasized that with the labor market normalizing a further weakening of demand may now generate a larger unemployment response than in the recent past when lower demand for labor was felt relatively more through fewer job openings committee policy actions in their discussions of monetary policy for this meeting members agreed that economic activity continued to ex pand at a solid pace job gains remained strong and the unemployment rate remained low inflation eased over the past year but remained elevated members con curred that in recent months there was modest further progress toward the committees percent inflation ob jective and agreed to acknowledge this development in the postmeeting statement members judged that the risks to achieving the committees employment and in flation goals had moved toward better balance over the past year members viewed the economic outlook as un certain and agreed that they remained highly attentive to inflation risks in support of the committees goals to achieve maxi mum employment and inflation at the rate of percent over the longer run members agreed to maintain the tar get range for the federal funds rate at to percent members concurred that in considering any adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate they would carefully assess incoming data the evolving outlook and the balance of risks members agreed that they did not expect that it would be appropriate to reduce the target range until they have gained greater confidence that in flation is moving sustainably toward percent in addi tion members agreed to continue to reduce the federal reserves holdings of treasury securities and agency debt and agency mortgagebacked securities all mem bers affirmed their strong commitment to returning in flation to the committees percent objective members agreed that in assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy they would continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook they would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerged that could impede the attainment of the committees goals members also agreed that their assessments would take page federal open market committee into account a wide range of information including readings on labor market conditions inflation pressures and inflation expectations and financial and interna tional developments at the conclusion of the discussion the committee voted to direct the federal reserve bank of new york until instructed otherwise to execute transactions in the soma in accordance with the following domestic policy directive for release at pm effective june

2024,fomcminutes20240731.pdf,minutes of the federal open market committee july a joint meeting of the federal open market committee and the board of governors of the federal reserve system was held in the offices of the board of governors on tuesday july at am and continued on wednesday july at am developments in financial markets and open market operations the manager turned first to a review of developments in financial markets financial conditions eased modestly over the intermeeting period reflecting lower longterm interest rates and higher equity prices the manager noted that current financial conditions appeared to be providing neither a headwind nor tailwind to growth nominal treasury yields declined over the period with shorterterm yields having decreased by more than longerterm yields leading to a steepening of the yield curve treasury yields remained sensitive to surprises in economic data particularly consumer price index releases and employment reports while nearterm inflation compensation fell over the intermeeting period longerterm forward measures were little changed measures of inflation expectations obtained from term structure models were modestly lower the policy rate path derived from futures prices and the modal path derived from options prices both declined over the intermeeting period and had come into closer alignment with the median of the modal responses from the open market desks survey of primary dealers and survey of market participants policy expectations however measured pointed to a first rate cut at the september fomc meeting at least one more cut later in the year and further policy easing next year in the equity markets the high perceived likelihood of a september cut in the target range for the policy rate induced a notable appreciation in the stocks of firms with small and medium capitalization which tend to be more sensitive to interest rates stocks of larger companies especially those in the technology sector underperformed secondquarter earnings reports received before the meeting had been slightly above analysts expectations although some companies noted a softening in consumer spending the federal open market committee is referenced as the fomc and the committee in these minutes the board of governors of the federal reserve system is referenced as the board in these minutes july expectations for policy rates in most advanced foreign economies afes declined as recent data generally pointed to continued progress on inflation although most afe central banks had cut their policy rates or were expected to do so soon the manager noted that market participants continued to expect the bank of japan to tighten policy this year the sudden announcement of a french election contributed to some shortterm market volatility early in the intermeeting period including a widening between yields of french and german year sovereign bonds and a widening in spreads for offthe run us treasury securities but the effects on us treasury markets were short lived the effective federal funds rate remained unchanged over the intermeeting period but the manager noted that rates on repurchase agreements repo had edged higher reflecting increased demand for financing treasury securities as well as the expected effects of gradual balance sheet normalization use of the overnight reverse repo on rrp facility declined slightly over the intermeeting period the staff projected that on rrp usage would decline more noticeably over the remainder of the year particularly as issuance of treasury bills increases however the manager noted that it was possible that idiosyncratic factors specific to some on rrp participants might support on rrp balances in the months ahead looking at a range of money market indicators the manager concluded that reserves remained abundant but indicated that the staff would continue to closely monitor developments in money markets finally the manager described a set of technical adjustments to the production of the secured overnight financing rate that the federal reserve bank of new york had proposed in a recent public consultation by unanimous vote the committee ratified the desks domestic transactions over the intermeeting period there were no intervention operations in foreign currencies for the systems account during the intermeeting period staff review of the economic situation the information available at the time of the meeting indicated that us economic activity had advanced solidly so far this year but at a markedly slower pace than in the second half of labor market conditions continued to ease job gains moderated and the unemployment rate moved up further but remained low consumer price inflation was well below its yearearlier pace but remained somewhat elevated consumer price inflationas measured by the month change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures pcewas about the same in june as it was at the start of the year though the monthovermonth changes in may and june were smaller than those seen earlier in the year total pce price inflation was percent in june and core pce price inflationwhich excludes changes in energy prices and many consumer food priceswas percent minutes of the federal open market committee recent data suggested that labor market conditions had eased further average monthly nonfarm payroll gains in the second quarter were smaller than the average pace seen in the first quarter and over the previous year the unemployment rate moved up further in june to percent the labor force participation rate ticked up as well and the employmenttopopulation ratio was unchanged the unemployment rate for african americans rose in june while the rate for hispanics declined slightly both rates were above that for whites the ratio of job vacancies to unemployment remained at in june about the same as its prepandemic level measures of nominal wages continued to decelerate average hourly earnings for all employees rose percent over the months ending in june down percentage point relative to a year earlier and the month change in the employment cost index of hourly compensation of private industry workers was percent in june down percentage point from its yearearlier pace according to the advance release real gross domestic product gdp rose solidly in the second quarter after a modest gain in the first quarter over the first half of the year gdp growth was noticeably slower than its average pace in however real private domestic final purchases pdfpwhich comprises pce and private fixed investment and which often provides a better signal than gdp of underlying economic momentumposted a solid secondquarter increase that was in line with its first quarter pace and only moderately slower than its average rate of increase in as in the first quarter net exports subtracted from us gdp growth in the second quarter growth in real exports of goods and services remained tepid overall as gains in exports of capital goods and consumer goods were partly offset by declines in exports of foods and industrial supplies by contrast real imports continued to rise at a brisk pace driven by further increases in imports of capital goods foreign economic growth was estimated to have been subdued in the second quarter held down by a sharp deceleration in economic activity in china amid ongoing propertysector woes in europe and latin america output likely expanded below its trend pace as restrictive monetary policy continued to be a drag on activity recent global inflation developments were mixed in the afes headline inflation edged down in the second quarter but generally remained above target levels in emerging market economies headline inflation rose a touch overall reflecting in part runups in food prices in some countries the bank of canada and the swiss national bank cut their policy rates further in part citing easing inflation pressures the peoples bank of china also lowered some key policy rates amid ongoing property sector woes and weak consumer sentiment july staff review of the financial situation the marketimplied path for the federal funds rate moved down over the intermeeting period options on interest rate futures suggested that market participants were placing higher odds on a larger policy easing by early than they did just before the june meeting consistent with the downward shift in the implied policy path nominal treasury yields moved down on net with the most pronounced declines at shorter horizons driven largely by decreases in inflation compensation broad stock price indexes rose slightly on net yield spreads on investment and speculativegrade corporate bonds were little changed and remained at about the lowest decile of their respective historical distributions the onemonth optionimplied volatility on the sp index rose moderately and was somewhat elevated by historical standards suggesting that investors perceived some but not outsized risks to the economic outlook marketbased measures of the expected paths of policy rates and sovereign bond yields in most afes fell notably largely in response to declines in us rates following the surprise announcement of parliamentary elections in france the spread between yields of french and german year sovereign bonds widened to its highest level since but then partially retraced on the outcome of no clear parliamentary majority the broad dollar index was little changed over the intermeeting period on balance moves in foreign risky asset prices were mixed and modest overnight secured rates edged up over the intermeeting period but conditions in us shortterm funding markets remained stable with typical dynamics observed surrounding quarterend average usage of the on rrp facility declined slightly banks total deposit levels increased modestly as large time deposits displayed moderate inflows in domestic credit markets borrowing costs remained elevated over the intermeeting period despite modest declines in some markets rates on year conforming residential mortgages declined on net over the intermeeting period but stayed near recent high levels interest rates on new credit card offers increased slightly while rates on new auto loans were little changed interest rates on small business loans remained elevated yields on an array of fixedincome securitiesincluding commercial mortgagebacked securities cmbs investment and speculativegrade corporate bonds and residential mortgagebacked securitiesmoved lower to stillelevated levels relative to recent history the declines were largely driven by decreases in treasury yields financing through capital markets and nonbank lenders was readily accessible for public corporations and large and middlemarket private corporations and credit availability for leveraged loan borrowers remained solid over the intermeeting period for smaller firms however credit availability remained moderately tight in the july senior loan officer opinion survey on bank lending practices sloos minutes of the federal open market committee banks reported modestly tighter standards and lending terms for commercial and industrial ci loans on net while reported demand for ci loans remained about unchanged meanwhile ci loan balances increased in the second quarter regarding commercial real estate cre loans banks in the july sloos reported tightening standards for all loan categories nonetheless bank cre loan balances increased over the second quarter albeit at a diminished pace relative to the previous quarter credit remained available for most consumers over the intermeeting period though credit growth showed signs of moderating credit card balances slowed in june and sloos respondents indicated that standards for credit cards tightened moderately in the second quarter although banks reported in the sloos that lending standards on auto loans were unchanged in the second quarter growth in auto lending at both banks and nonbanks contracted further in the residential mortgage market access to credit was little changed overall and continued to depend on borrowers credit risk attributes credit quality remained solid for large and midsize firms home mortgage borrowers and municipalities but continued to deteriorate in other sectors the credit quality of nonfinancial firms borrowing in the corporate bond and leveraged loan markets remained stable delinquency rates on loans to small businesses remained slightly above prepandemic levels credit quality in the cre market deteriorated further with the average delinquency rate for loans in cmbs and the share of nonperforming cre loans at banks both rising further regarding household balance sheets delinquency rates on most residential mortgages remained near prepandemic lows though consumer delinquency rates had increased particularly among nonprime borrowers the rise in delinquency rates for both credit cards and auto loans slowed in the second quarter the staff provided an update on its assessment of the stability of the us financial system and on balance continued to characterize the systems financial vulnerabilities as notable the staff judged that asset valuation pressures remained elevated with estimates of risk premiums across key markets low compared with historical standards house prices remained elevated relative to fundamentals cre prices continued to decline especially in the multifamily and office sectors and vacancy rates in these sectors continued to increase vulnerabilities associated with business and household debt were characterized as moderate nonfinancial business leverage was high but the ability of public firms to service their debt remained solid in large part due to strong earnings the fraction of private firms with low debtservicing ability continued to move up and remained at high levels compared with the past decade household balance sheets remained strong overall as aggregate home equity stayed quite high and delinquencies on mortgage loans remained low july leverage in the financial sector was characterized as notable regulatory capital ratios in the banking sector remained high the fair value of bank assets however remained low for the nonbank sector leverage at hedge funds was at its highest recorded level based on data since partly due to the prevalence of the cashfutures basis trade leverage at life insurers was somewhat elevated and their holdings of risky and illiquid securities continued to grow funding risks were also characterized as notable assets in prime money market funds and other runnable cashmanagement vehicles remained near historical highs life insurers greater reliance on nontraditional liabilities coupled with their increasing holdings of risky corporate debt suggested that adverse shocks to the industry could trigger substantial funding pressures at these firms staff economic outlook the economic forecast prepared by the staff for the july meeting implied a lower rate of resource utilization over the projection period relative to the forecast prepared for the previous meeting the staffs outlook for growth in the second half of had been marked down largely in response to weakerthanexpected labor market indicators as a result the output gap at the start of was somewhat narrower than had been previously projected although still not fully closed over and real gdp growth was expected to rise about in line with potential leaving the output gap roughly flat in those years the unemployment rate was expected to edge up slightly over the remainder of and then to remain roughly unchanged in and the staffs inflation forecast was slightly lower than the one prepared for the previous meeting reflecting incoming data and the lower projected level of resource utilization both total and core pce price inflation were expected to decline further as demand and supply in product and labor markets continued to move into better balance by total and core inflation were expected to be around percent the staff continued to view the uncertainty around the baseline projection as close to the average over the past years risks to the inflation forecast were still seen as tilted to the upside albeit to a smaller degree than at the time of the previous meeting the risks around the forecast for real activity were viewed as skewed to the downside both because morepersistent inflation could result in tighter financial conditions than in the baseline and because the recent softening in some indicators of labor market conditions might be pointing to a largerthananticipated slowdown in aggregate demand growth minutes of the federal open market committee participants views on current conditions and the economic outlook participants observed that inflation had eased over the past year but remained elevated and that in recent months there had been some further progress toward the committees percent inflation objective participants noted that the recent progress on disinflation was broad based across the major subcomponents of core inflation core goods prices were about flat from march through june after having risen during the first three months of the year price inflation in june for housing services showed a notable slowing which participants had been anticipating for some time in addition core nonhousing services prices had decelerated in recent months some participants noted that the recent data corroborated reports from their business contacts that firms pricing power was waning as consumers appeared to be more sensitive to price increases various contacts had also reported that they had cut prices or were offering discounts to stay competitive or that declines in input costs had helped reduce pressure on retail prices with regard to the outlook for inflation participants judged that recent data had increased their confidence that inflation was moving sustainably toward percent almost all participants observed that the factors that had contributed to recent disinflation would likely continue to put downward pressure on inflation in coming months these factors included a continued waning of pricing power moderating economic growth and the runoff in excess household savings accumulated during the pandemic many participants noted that the moderation of growth in labor costs as labor market conditions rebalanced would continue to contribute to disinflation particularly in core nonhousing services prices some participants noted that the lags in the time it takes for housing rental conditions for new tenants to show through to aggregate price data for housing services meant that the disinflationary trend in this component would likely continue participants also observed that longerterm inflation expectations had remained well anchored and viewed this anchoring as underpinning the disinflation process a couple of participants noted that inflation pressures might persist for some time as they assessed that the economy had considerable momentum and that even with some easing of the demand for labor the labor market remained strong participants assessed that supply and demand conditions in the labor market had continued to come into better balance the unemployment rate had moved up but remained low having risen percentage point since its trough in april to percent in june the monthly pace of payroll job gains had moderated from the first quarter but had been solid in recent months however many participants noted that reported payroll gains might be overstated and several assessed that payroll gains may be lower than those needed to keep the unemployment rate constant with a flat labor force participation rate participants observed that other indicators also pointed to easing in labor market conditions including a lower hiring rate and a downtrend in job vacancies since the beginning of the july year participants noted that the rebalancing of labor market conditions over the past year was also aided by an expansion of the supply of workers reflecting increases in the labor force participation rate among individuals aged to and a strong pace of immigration participants noted that with continued rebalancing of labor market conditions nominal wage growth had continued to moderate many participants cited reports from district contacts that supported the view that labor market conditions had been easing in particular contacts reported that they had been experiencing less difficulty in hiring and retaining workers and that they saw limited wage pressures participants generally assessed that overall conditions in the labor market had returned to about where they stood on the eve of the pandemicstrong but not overheated regarding the outlook for the labor market participants discussed various indicators of layoffs including initial claims for unemployment benefits and measures of job separations some participants commented that these indicators had remained at levels consistent with a strong labor market participants agreed that these and other indicators of labor market conditions merited close monitoring several participants said that their district contacts reported that they were actively managing head counts through selective hiring and attrition participants noted that real gdp growth was solid in the first half of the year though slower than the robust pace seen in the second half of last year pdfp growth which usually gives a better signal than gdp growth of economic momentum also moderated in the first half but by less than gdp growth pdfp expanded at a solid pace supported by growth in consumer spending and business fixed investment participants viewed the moderation in the growth of economic activity to be largely in line with what they had anticipated regarding the household sector participants observed that consumer spending had slowed from last years robust pace consistent with restrictive monetary policy easing of labor market conditions and slowing income growth they noted however that consumer spending had still grown at a solid pace in the first half of the year supported by the stillstrong labor market and aggregate household balance sheets some participants observed that lower and moderateincome households were encountering increasing strains as they attempted to meet higher living costs after having largely run down savings accumulated during the pandemic these participants noted that such strains were evident in indicators such as rising credit card delinquency rates and an increased share of households paying the minimum due on balances and warranted continued close monitoring several participants cited reports that consumers especially those in lowerincome households were shifting away from discretionary spending and switching to lowercost food items and brands a couple of participants remarked that spending by some higherincome households was likely being bolstered by wealth effects from equity and housing price appreciation participants noted that residential minutes of the federal open market committee investment was weak in the second quarter likely reflecting the pickup in mortgage rates from earlier in the year regarding the business sector participants noted that conditions varied by firm size sector and region a couple of participants noted that their district contacts had reported larger firms as having a generally stable outlook while the outlook for smaller firms appeared more uncertain a few participants said that their contacts reported that conditions in the manufacturing sector were somewhat weaker while the professional and business services sector and technologyrelated sectors remained strong a few participants noted that the agricultural sector continued to face strains stemming from low food commodity prices and high input costs participants discussed the risks and uncertainties around the economic outlook upside risks to the inflation outlook were seen as having diminished while downside risks to employment were seen as having increased participants saw risks to achieving the inflation and employment objectives as continuing to move into better balance with a couple noting that they viewed these risks as more or less balanced some participants noted that as conditions in the labor market have eased the risk had increased that continued easing could transition to a more serious deterioration as sources of upside risks to inflation some participants cited the potential for disruptions to supply chains and a further deterioration in geopolitical conditions a few participants noted that an easing of financial conditions could boost economic activity and present an upside risk to economic growth and inflation in their discussion of financial stability participants who commented noted vulnerabilities to the financial system that they assessed warranted monitoring some participants observed that the banking system was sound but noted risks associated with unrealized losses on securities reliance on uninsured deposits and interconnections with nonbank financial intermediaries in their discussion of bank funding several participants commented that because the discount window is an important liquidity backstop the federal reserve should continue to improve the windows operational efficiency and to communicate effectively about the windows value participants generally noted that some banks and nonbank financial institutions likely have vulnerabilities associated with high cre exposures through loan portfolios and holdings of cmbs most of these participants remarked that risks related to cre exposures depend importantly on the property type and the local market conditions of the properties involved a couple of participants noted concerns about asset valuation pressures in other markets as well many participants commented on cyber risks that could impair the operation of financial institutions financial infrastructure and potentially the overall economy many participants remarked that because a few firms play a substantial role in the provision of information technology services to the financial sector and because of the highly interconnected nature of some firms in the financial industry itself there was an increased risk that significant cyber disruptions at a small number of key firms could have widespread effects several participants noted that leverage in july the treasury market remained a risk that it would be important to monitor developments regarding treasury market resilience amid the move to central clearing or that it is valuable to communicate about the federal reserves standing repo facility as a liquidity backstop a couple of participants commented on the financial condition of low and moderateincome households that have exhausted their savings and the importance of monitoring rising delinquency rates on credit cards and auto loans in their consideration of monetary policy at this meeting participants observed that recent indicators suggested that economic activity had continued to expand at a solid pace job gains had moderated and the unemployment rate had moved up but remained low while inflation remained somewhat above the committees longerrun goal of percent participants noted that inflation had eased over the past year and that recent incoming data indicated some further progress toward the committees objective all participants supported maintaining the target range for the federal funds rate at to percent although several observed that the recent progress on inflation and increases in the unemployment rate had provided a plausible case for reducing the target range basis points at this meeting or that they could have supported such a decision participants furthermore judged that it was appropriate to continue the process of reducing the federal reserves securities holdings in discussing the outlook for monetary policy participants noted that growth in economic activity had been solid there had been some further progress on inflation and conditions in the labor market had eased almost all participants remarked that while the incoming data regarding inflation were encouraging additional information was needed to provide greater confidence that inflation was moving sustainably toward the committees percent objective before it would be appropriate to lower the target range for the federal funds rate nevertheless participants viewed the incoming data as enhancing their confidence that inflation was moving toward the committees objective the vast majority observed that if the data continued to come in about as expected it would likely be appropriate to ease policy at the next meeting many participants commented that monetary policy continued to be restrictive although they expressed a range of views about the degree of restrictiveness and a few participants noted that ongoing disinflation with no change in the nominal target range for the policy rate by itself results in a tightening in monetary policy most participants remarked on the importance of communicating the committees datadependent approach and emphasized in particular that monetary policy decisions are conditional on the evolution of the economy rather than being on a preset path or that those decisions depend on the totality of the incoming data rather than on any particular data point several participants stressed the need to monitor conditions in money markets and factors affecting the demand for reserves amid the ongoing reduction in the federal reserves balance sheet minutes of the federal open market committee in discussing riskmanagement considerations that could bear on the outlook for monetary policy participants highlighted uncertainties affecting the outlook such as those regarding the amount of restraint currently provided by monetary policy the lags with which past and current restraint have affected and will affect economic activity and the degree of normalization of the economy following disruptions associated with the pandemic a majority of participants remarked that the risks to the employment goal had increased and many participants noted that the risks to the inflation goal had decreased some participants noted the risk that a further gradual easing in labor market conditions could transition to a more serious deterioration many participants noted that reducing policy restraint too late or too little could risk unduly weakening economic activity or employment a couple participants highlighted in particular the costs and challenges of addressing such a weakening once it is fully under way several participants remarked that reducing policy restraint too soon or too much could risk a resurgence in aggregate demand and a reversal of the progress on inflation these participants pointed to risks related to potential shocks that could put upward pressure on inflation or the possibility that inflation could prove more persistent than currently expected committee policy actions in their discussions of monetary policy for this meeting members agreed that economic activity had continued to expand at a solid pace job gains had moderated and the unemployment rate had moved up but remained low inflation eased over the past year but remained somewhat elevated members concurred that in recent months there had been some further progress toward the committees percent inflation objective members judged that the risks to achieving the committees employment and inflation goals had continued to move into better balance members viewed the economic outlook as uncertain and agreed that they were attentive to the risks to both sides of the committees dual mandate

percent members concurred that in considering any adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate they would carefully assess incoming data the evolving outlook and the balance of risks members agreed that they did not expect that it would be appropriate to reduce the target range until they had gained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward percent in addition members agreed to continue to reduce the federal reserves holdings of treasury securities and agency debt and agency mortgagebacked securities all members affirmed their strong commitment to returning inflation to the committees percent objective members agreed that in assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy they would continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook they would be prepared to july adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerged that could impede the attainment of the committees goals members also agreed that their assessments would take into account a wide range of information including readings on labor market conditions inflation pressures and inflation expectations and financial and international developments members agreed that to appropriately reflect developments since the previous meeting related to their maximumemployment objective they should note in the statement that job gains have moderated and the unemployment rate has moved up but remains low similarly to appropriately reflect developments related to their pricestability objective they agreed to note that there has been some further progress toward the committees percent inflation objective members also agreed to reflect the shifting balance of risks by stating that the committee judges that the risks to achieving its employment and inflation goals continue to move into better balance and that the committee is attentive to the risks to both sides of its dual mandate at the conclusion of the discussion the committee voted to direct the federal reserve bank of new york until instructed otherwise to execute transactions in the system open market account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive for

2024,fomcminutes20240918.pdf,minutes of the federal open market committee september a joint meeting of the federal open market committee and the board of governors of the federal reserve system was held in the offices of the board of governors on tuesday september at am and continued on wednesday september at am developments in financial markets and open market operations the manager turned first to a review of developments in financial markets nominal treasury yields declined notably over the period driven by weakerthanexpected data releasesespecially the july employment report in early augustand policy communications that were seen as affirming expectations that a reduction in policy restraint would begin at this meeting the decline in nominal yields over the period was primarily attributable to lower expected real yields but measures of inflation compensation declined as well broad equity prices finished the period modestly higher while credit spreads had come off the very tight levels seen earlier this year but were still narrow by historical standards overall risky asset prices were compatible with continued economic expansion the manager also discussed the brief episode of elevated market volatility in early august that episode saw some large moves in us and foreign equity indexes equityimplied volatilities the dollaryen exchange rate and treasury yields these sharp moves appeared to be the result of a rapid unwinding of some speculative trading positions induced by unrelated eventssuch as the unexpectedly inflationfocused communications from the bank of japan boj in late july and the weakerthanexpected us employment report in early augustand amplified by technical and liquidity factors all told the unwinding process was contained and market functioning recovered relatively quickly turning to policy expectations the manager noted that the marketimplied policy rate path shifted down materially at the time of the september meeting the modal path for the federal funds rate implied by options prices was consistent with about basis points of cuts through yearend compared with around basis points at the time of the july meeting the average path for the federal funds rate obtained from futures prices also shifted notably lower and remained below the optionsimplied modal path likely reflecting investors perception that risks were tilted toward more the federal open market committee is referenced as the fomc and the committee in these minutes the board of governors of the federal reserve system is referenced as the board in these minutes september rather than fewer cuts in the open market desks survey of primary dealers and survey of market participants most respondents had a modal expectation of a basis point cut at this meeting though the manager also noted that since the time of the surveysabout a week earlierthe probability of a basis point cut at the september meeting implied by futures prices had increased and exceeded the implied probability of a basis point cut the median respondents modal path for the federal funds rate shifted down notably over the next two years in line with the optionsimplied modal path and was unchanged thereafter balance sheet expectations in the surveys were little changed from july most survey respondents did not appear to be concerned about an economic downturn in either the near or medium term the median dealers most likely path of the unemployment rate for the next few years was only modestly higher than that in the july survey and was roughly stable around current levels in international developments many central banks in advanced foreign economies afes had begun or continued to lower policy rates during the intermeeting period with the bank of england boe deciding to initiate its ratecutting cycle with a basis point reduction and the european central bank ecb and the bank of canada boc delivering their second and third basis point cut respectively the marketimplied expectations for yearend policy rates fell over the period for most central banks in afes although by a smaller amount than they did for the federal reserve contributing to a modest decline in the tradeweighted us dollar index the manager then turned to money markets and desk operations unsecured overnight rates remained stable over the intermeeting period in secured funding markets rates on overnight repurchase agreements repo were higher than a few months earlier amid large issuance of treasury securities and elevated demand for securities financing but were little changed on net over the period the manager discussed the interconnections between the repo and federal funds markets underscoring the importance of monitoring a range of indicators to assess reserve conditions and the state of money markets looking at a range of such indicators the manager concluded that reserves appeared to remain abundant usage of the overnight reverse repurchase agreement on rrp facility declined about billion over the intermeeting period helped by an increase in the net supply of treasury bills with net bill supply expected to decrease as a result of the september tax date before increasing again the staff assessed that the decline in on rrp usage might slow over the coming intermeeting period before resuming later this year the manager also added that with the concentration of on rrp usage in a small number of fund complexes there was an increased risk that idiosyncratic allocation decisions could have an outsized effect on aggregate on rrp volumes minutes of the federal open market committee by unanimous vote the committee ratified the desks domestic transactions over the intermeeting period there were no intervention operations in foreign currencies for the systems account during the intermeeting period staff review of the economic situation the information available at the time of the meeting indicated that real gross domestic product gdp had expanded solidly so far this year the pace of job gains continued to moderate since the beginning of the year and the unemployment rate had moved up but remained low consumer price inflation was well below its yearearlier rate but remained somewhat elevated consumer price inflationas measured by the month change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures pcewas lower in july than it had been in march which had followed some high monthovermonth changes in the beginning of the year monthly changes in pce prices since april had been smaller than those seen in the first three months of the year on a month basis total pce price inflation was percent in july and core pce price inflationwhich excludes changes in energy prices and many consumer food priceswas percent in august the month change in the consumer price index cpi was percent and core cpi inflation was percent both measures were well below their rates from a year ago the staff estimated given both the cpi and producer price index data that total pce price inflation would be percent over the months ending in august and that core pce price inflation would be percent recent data suggested that labor market conditions had eased further but remained solid over july and august average monthly nonfarm payroll gains were less than their average secondquarter pace the unemployment rate edged up to percent the labor force participation rate ticked up and the employmenttopopulation ratio ticked down the unemployment rate for african americans moved down while the rate for hispanics rose and both rates were above those for asians and for whites the ratio of job vacancies to unemployment edged down to in august a bit below its level just before the pandemic job layoffs as measured by initial claims for unemployment insurance benefits remained low through august measures of nominal labor compensation continued to decelerate average hourly earnings for all employees rose percent over the months ending in august and the fourquarter change in businesssector compensation per hour was percent in the second quarter both measures were well below their pace from a year earlier real gdp rose solidly on balance over the first half of the year real private domestic final purchases pdfpwhich comprises pce and private fixed investment and which often provides a better signal than gdp of underlying economic momentumposted a stronger firsthalf increase than gdp and pdfp growth over the first half was only moderately slower than last year recent indicators for third september quarter gdp and pdfp suggested that economic growth was continuing at a solid pace particularly for pce and business investment in equipment and intangibles after growing at a tepid pace in the second quarter real exports of goods moved down in july led by declines in exports of autos and industrial supplies by contrast real imports of goods especially of capital goods continued to grow at a robust pace in july real gdp growth in foreign economies stepped down in the second quarter and recent economic indicators suggested economic growth abroad remained subdued although services activity and high tech manufacturing had been relatively robust overall manufacturing activity remained weak in part due to restrictive monetary policies weakness in manufacturing was particularly pronounced in canada germany and mexico in china indicators of domestic demand remained weak inflation in economies abroad continued to abate on net though developments were mixed in the afes excluding japan month headline inflation ticked down but remained above target levels due to stillhigh services inflation in the emerging market economies inflation moved sideways with some latin american economies still experiencing upward inflation pressures from food prices the boe cut its policy rate for the first time in the current cycle while the boc the ecb and the bank of mexico eased policy further in part citing progress toward achieving their inflation targets by contrast the boj continued to remove monetary accommodation staff review of the financial situation the marketimplied path for the federal funds rate declined notably over the intermeeting period similarly options on interest rate futures suggested that market participants were placing higher odds on greater policy easing by early than they had just before the july fomc meeting consistent with the downward shift in the implied policy rate path nominal treasury yields declined significantly on net with the most pronounced decreases at shorter horizons driven by reductions in both inflation compensation and real treasury yields marketbased measures of interest rate uncertainty in the near term rose notably reportedly reflecting in part increased concerns among investors about downside risks to economic activity broad stock price indexes increased on net despite a sizable but temporary drop in early august yield spreads on investment and speculativegrade corporate bonds were little changed on net and remained in the bottom quintile of their respective historical distributions the onemonth option implied volatility on the sp index ended the period roughly unchanged on net after a large but temporary spike in early august minutes of the federal open market committee overnight secured rates were largely unchanged and conditions in us shortterm funding markets remained stable average usage of the on rrp facility declined as net treasury bill issuance increased providing a more attractive alternative asset for money market funds marketbased measures of the expected paths of policy rates as well as sovereign bond yields in most afes fell notably largely in response to declines in us interest rates the broad dollar index declined with the dollar depreciating significantly against afe currencies amid a narrowing in interest rate differentials between the us economy and afes financial markets were volatile early in the intermeeting period following the weakerthanexpected us employment report and the policy rate increase by the boj which led to the unwinding of some speculative trading positions however declines in equities mostly retraced over the following weeks and moves in foreign risky asset prices were mixed over the intermeeting period in domestic credit markets borrowing costs remained elevated despite modest declines in most credit segments rates on year conforming residential mortgages and yields on agency mortgagebacked securities mbs declined on net but continued to be elevated interest rates on both new credit card offers and new auto loans were little changed and remained at elevated levels interest rates for newly originated commercial real estate cre loans on banks books increased yields on an array of fixedincome securities including investment and speculativegrade corporate bonds and commercial mortgagebacked securities cmbs moved lower generally following decreases in benchmark treasury yields financing through capital markets and nonbank lenders was readily accessible for public corporations and for large and middlemarket private corporations and credit availability for leveraged loan borrowers remained solid for smaller firms however credit availability remained moderately tight commercial and industrial loan balances at banks were little changed on net credit remained generally accessible to most cre borrowers cre loans at banks continued to decelerate in july and were unchanged in august nonagency cmbs issuance was robust in august while agency cmbs issuance slipped to a bit below its postpandemic average credit remained available for most consumers though credit growth showed signs of moderating auto lending continued to slow while balances on credit cards increased moderately in july and august on average in the residential mortgage market access to credit was little changed overall and continued to be sensitive to borrowers credit risk attributes credit quality continued to be solid for large and midsize firms home mortgage borrowers and municipalities but kept deteriorating in other sectors the credit quality of nonfinancial firms borrowing in the corporate bond and leveraged loan markets remained stable delinquency rates on loans to small businesses remained slightly above prepandemic levels credit quality in the cre september market deteriorated further with the average delinquency rate for loans in cmbs and the share of nonperforming cre loans at banks both rising further regarding household credit quality delinquency rates on most residential mortgages remained near prepandemic lows though consumer loan delinquency rates remained above prepandemic levels the pace of increases had slowed delinquency rates for credit cards rose moderately in the second quarter while they were largely flat for auto loans staff economic outlook the staff forecast at the september meeting was for the economy to remain solid with real gdp growth about the same as in the forecast for the july meeting but the unemployment rate a little higher although real gdp growth in the second quarter was stronger than the staff had expected the forecast for economic growth in the second half of this year was marked down largely in response to recent softerthanexpected labor market indicators the real gdp growth forecast for as a whole was little changed though the unemployment rate was expected to be a little higher at the end of the year than previously forecast over through real gdp growth was expected to rise about in line with the staffs estimate of potential output growth the unemployment rate was expected to remain roughly flat from through all told supply and demand in labor and product markets were forecast to be more balanced and resource utilization less tight than they had been in recent years the staffs inflation forecast was slightly lower than the one prepared for the previous meeting primarily reflecting incoming data along with the projection of a less tight economy both total and core pce price inflation were expected to decline further as supply and demand in labor and product markets continued to move into better balance by total and core inflation were expected to be percent the staff judged that the risks around the baseline forecast for economic activity were tilted to the downside as the recent softening in some indicators of labor market conditions could point to greater slowing in aggregate demand growth than expected the risks around the inflation forecast were seen as roughly balanced reflecting both the further progress on disinflation and the effects of downside risks for economic activity on inflation the staff continued to view the uncertainty around the baseline projection as close to the average over the past years participants views on current conditions and the economic outlook in conjunction with this fomc meeting participants submitted their projections of the most likely outcomes for real gdp growth the unemployment rate and inflation for each year from through and over the longer run these projections were based on participants individual assessments minutes of the federal open market committee of appropriate monetary policy including their projections of the federal funds rate the longerrun projections represented each participants assessment of the rate to which each variable would tend to converge under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy the summary of economic projections was released to the public after the meeting in their discussion of inflation developments participants observed that inflation remained somewhat elevated but almost all participants judged that recent monthly readings had been consistent with inflation returning sustainably to percent some participants commented that though food and energy prices had played an important part in the decline in the overall inflation rate slower rates of price increases had become more evident across a broad range of goods and services notably core goods prices had declined in recent months and the rate of increase in core nonhousing services prices had moved down further many participants remarked that the recent inflation data were consistent with reports received from business contacts who had indicated that their pricing power was limited or diminishing and that consumers were increasingly seeking discounts many participants also observed that inflation developments in the second and third quarters of suggested that the strongerthananticipated inflation readings in the first quarter had been only a temporary interruption of progress toward percent participants remarked that even though the rate of increase in housing services prices had slowed these prices were continuing to rise at an elevated rate in contrast to many other core prices with regard to the outlook for inflation almost all participants indicated they had gained greater confidence that inflation was moving sustainably toward percent participants cited various factors that were likely to put continuing downward pressure on inflation these included a further modest slowing in real gdp growth in part due to the committees restrictive monetary policy stance well anchored inflation expectations waning pricing power increases in productivity and a softening in world commodity prices several participants noted that nominal wage growth was continuing to slow with a few participants citing signs that it was set to decline further these signs included lower rates of increases in cyclically sensitive wages and data indicating that job switchers were no longer receiving a wage premium over other employees a couple of participants remarked that with wages being a relatively large portion of business costs in the services sector that sectors disinflation process would be particularly assisted by slower nominal wage growth in addition several participants observed that with supply and demand in the labor market roughly in balance wage increases were unlikely to be a source of general inflation pressures in the near future with regard to housing services prices some participants suggested that a more rapid disinflationary trend might emerge fairly soon reflecting the slower pace of rent increases faced by new tenants participants emphasized that inflation remained somewhat elevated and that they were strongly committed to returning inflation to the committees percent objective september participants noted that labor market conditions had eased further in recent months and that after being overheated in recent years the labor market was now less tight than it had been just before the pandemic as evidence participants cited the slowdown in payroll employment growth and the uptick in the unemployment rate in the two employment reports received since the committees july meeting lower readings on hiring and job vacancies reduced quits and jobfinding rates and widespread reports from business contacts of less difficulty in hiring workers some participants highlighted the fact that the unemployment rate had risen notably on net since april participants noted however that labor market conditions remained solid as layoffs had been limited and initial claims for unemployment insurance benefits had stayed low some participants stressed that rather than using layoffs to lower their demand for labor businesses had instead been taking steps such as posting fewer openings reducing hours or making use of attrition a few participants suggested that firms remained reluctant to lay off workers after having difficulty obtaining employees earlier in the postpandemic period some participants remarked that the recent pace of payroll increases had fallen short of what was required to keep the unemployment rate stable on a sustained basis assuming a constant labor force participation rate many participants observed that the evaluation of labor market developments had been challenging with increased immigration revisions to reported payroll data and possible changes in the underlying growth rate of productivity cited as complicating factors several participants emphasized the importance of continuing to use disaggregated data or information provided by business contacts as a check on readings on labor market conditions obtained from aggregate data participants agreed that labor market conditions were at or close to those consistent with the committees longerrun goal of maximum employment with regard to the outlook for the labor market participants noted that further cooling did not appear to be needed to help bring inflation back to percent participants indicated that in their baseline economic outlooks which included an appropriate recalibration of the committees monetary policy stance the labor market would remain solid participants agreed that labor market indicators merited close monitoring with some noting that as conditions in the labor market have eased the risk had increased that continued easing could transition to a more serious deterioration participants observed that economic activity had continued to expand at a solid pace and highlighted resilient consumption spending a couple of participants noted that rising real household incomes had bolstered consumption though some cited signs of a slowing in expenditures or of strains on household budgets including increased delinquencies in credit card and automobile loans a couple of participants suggested that the financial strains being experienced by low and moderateincome households would likely imply slower consumption growth in coming periods various participants reported that their business contacts were optimistic about the economic outlook though they were exercising caution in their hiring and investment decisions participants noted that favorable minutes of the federal open market committee aggregate supply developments including increases in productivity had contributed to the recent solid expansion of economic activity and a few participants discussed possible implications of the introduction of new technology into the workplace many participants emphasized that they expected that real gdp would grow at roughly its trend rate over the next few years participants discussed the risks and uncertainties associated with the economic outlook almost all participants saw upside risks to the inflation outlook as having diminished while downside risks to employment were seen as having increased as a result those participants now assessed the risks to achieving the committees dualmandate goals as being roughly in balance a couple of participants however did not perceive an increased risk of a significant further weakening in labor market conditions several participants cited risks of a sharperthanexpected slowing in consumer spending in response to labor market cooling or to continuing strains on the budgets of low and moderate income households risks to achieving the committees pricestability goal had diminished significantly since the target range for the federal funds rate was last raised and the vast majority of participants saw the risks to inflation as broadly balanced a couple of participants specifically noted upside inflation risks associated with geopolitical developments in addition some participants cited risks that progress toward the committees percent inflation objective could be stalled by a larger thananticipated easing in financial conditions strongerthanexpected consumption growth or continued strong increases in housing services prices in their consideration of monetary policy at this meeting participants noted that inflation had made further progress toward the committees objective but remained somewhat elevated almost all participants expressed greater confidence that inflation was moving sustainably toward percent participants also observed that recent indicators suggested that economic activity had continued to expand at a solid pace job gains had slowed and the unemployment rate had moved up but remained low almost all participants judged that the risks to achieving the committees employment and inflation goals were roughly in balance in light of the progress on inflation and the balance of risks all participants agreed that it was appropriate to ease the stance of monetary policy given the significant progress made since the committee first set its target range for the federal funds rate at to percent a substantial majority of participants supported lowering the target range for the federal funds rate by basis points to to percent these participants generally observed that such a recalibration of the stance of monetary policy would begin to bring it into better alignment with recent indicators of inflation and the labor market they also emphasized that such a move would help sustain the strength in the economy and the labor market while continuing to promote progress on inflation and would reflect the balance of risks some participants noted that there had been a plausible case for a basis point rate cut at the previous meeting and that data over the intermeeting period had provided further evidence that inflation was on a sustainable path toward september percent while the labor market continued to cool however noting that inflation was still somewhat elevated while economic growth remained solid and unemployment remained low some participants observed that they would have preferred a basis point reduction of the target range at this meeting and a few others indicated that they could have supported such a decision several participants noted that a basis point reduction would be in line with a gradual path of policy normalization that would allow policymakers time to assess the degree of policy restrictiveness as the economy evolved a few participants also added that a basis point move could signal a more predictable path of policy normalization a few participants remarked that the overall path of policy normalization rather than the specific amount of initial easing at this meeting would be more important in determining the degree of policy restriction participants judged that it was appropriate to continue the process of reducing the federal reserves securities holdings in discussing the outlook for monetary policy participants anticipated that if the data came in about as expected with inflation moving down sustainably to percent and the economy near maximum employment it would likely be appropriate to move toward a more neutral stance of policy over time participants emphasized that it was important to communicate that the recalibration of the stance of policy at this meeting should not be interpreted as evidence of a less favorable economic outlook or as a signal that the pace of policy easing would be more rapid than participants assessments of the appropriate path those who commented on the degree of restrictiveness of monetary policy observed that they believed it to be restrictive though they expressed a range of views about the degree of restrictiveness participants generally remarked on the importance of communicating that the committees monetary policy decisions are conditional on the evolution of the economy and the implications for the economic outlook and balance of risks and therefore not on a preset course several participants discussed the importance of communicating that the ongoing reduction in the federal reserves balance sheet could continue for some time even as the committee reduced its target range for the federal funds rate in discussing riskmanagement considerations that could bear on the outlook for monetary policy almost all participants agreed that the upside risks to inflation had diminished and most remarked that the downside risks to employment had increased some participants emphasized that reducing policy restraint too late or too little could risk unduly weakening economic activity and employment a few participants highlighted in particular the costs and challenges of addressing such a weakening once it is fully under way several participants remarked that reducing policy restraint too soon or too much could risk a stalling or a reversal of the progress on inflation some participants noted that uncertainties concerning the level of the longerterm neutral rate of interest complicated the assessment of the degree of restrictiveness of policy and in their view made it appropriate to reduce policy restraint gradually minutes of the federal open market committee committee policy actions in their discussions of monetary policy for this meeting members agreed that economic activity had continued to expand at a solid pace job gains had slowed and the unemployment rate had moved up but remained low members concurred that there had been further progress toward the committees percent inflation objective but that inflation remained somewhat elevated almost all members agreed that to appropriately reflect cumulative developments related to inflation and the balance of risks the postmeeting statement should note that they had gained greater confidence that inflation was moving sustainably toward percent and judged that the risks to achieving the committees employment and inflation goals were roughly in balance members viewed the economic outlook as uncertain and agreed that they were attentive to the risks to both sides of the committees dual mandate in light of the progress on inflation and the balance of risks the committee decided to lower the target range for the federal funds rate to to percent one member voted against that decision preferring to lower the target range for the federal funds rate to to percent members concurred that in considering additional adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate they would carefully assess incoming data the evolving outlook and the balance of risks members agreed to continue to reduce the federal reserves holdings of treasury securities and agency debt and agency mbs all members agreed that the postmeeting statement should affirm their strong commitment both to supporting maximum employment and to returning inflation to the committees percent objective members agreed that in assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy they would continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook they would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerged that could impede the attainment of the committees goals members also agreed that their assessments would take into account a wide range of information including readings on labor market conditions inflation pressures and inflation expectations and financial and international developments at the conclusion of the discussion the committee voted to direct the federal reserve bank of new york until instructed otherwise to execute transactions in the system open market account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive for release at pm effective september the federal open market committee directs the desk to undertake open market operations as necessary to maintain the federal funds rate in a target range of to percent september conduct standing overnight repurchase agreement operations with a minimum bid rate of percent and with an aggregate operation limit of billion conduct standing overnight reverse repurchase agreement operations at an offering rate of percent and with a percounterparty limit of billion per day roll over at auction the amount of principal payments from the federal reserves holdings of treasury securities maturing in each calendar month that exceeds a cap of billion per month redeem treasury coupon securities up to this monthly cap and treasury bills to the extent that coupon principal payments are less than the monthly cap reinvest the

treasury securities to roughly match the maturity composition of treasury securities outstanding allow modest deviations from stated amounts for reinvestments if needed for operational reasons engage in dollar roll and coupon swap transactions as necessary to facilitate settlement of the federal reserves agency mbs transactions the vote also encompassed approval of the statement below for release at pm recent indicators suggest that economic activity has continued to expand at a solid pace job gains have slowed and the unemployment rate has moved up but remains low inflation has made further progress toward the committees percent objective but remains somewhat elevated the committee seeks to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of percent over the longer run the committee has gained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward percent and judges that the risks to achieving its employment and inflation goals are roughly in balance the economic outlook is uncertain and the committee is attentive to the risks to both sides of its dual mandate in light of the progress on inflation and the balance of risks the committee decided to lower the target range for the federal funds rate by percentage point to to percent in considering additional adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate the committee will carefully assess incoming data the evolving outlook and the balance of risks the committee will continue reducing its holdings of treasury securities and agency debt and minutes of the federal open market committee agency mortgagebacked securities the committee is strongly committed to supporting maximum employment and returning inflation to its percent objective in assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy

for the federal funds rate by basis points to to percent in light of core inflation remaining well above the committees objective a labor market that is near full employment and solid underlying growth she also expressed her concern that the committees larger policy action could be seen as a premature declaration of victory on the pricestability part of the dual mandate consistent with the committees decision to lower the target range for the federal funds rate to to percent the board of governors of the federal reserve system voted unanimously to lower the interest rate paid on reserve

2024,fomcminutes20241107.pdf,minutes of the federal open market committee november a joint meeting of the federal open market committee and the board of governors of the federal reserve system was held in the offices of the board of governors on wednesday november at am and continued on thursday november at am developments in financial markets and open market operations the manager turned first to a review of developments in financial markets nominal treasury yields rose notably over the period factors driving the increases in yields included strongerthanexpected data releases and monetary policy communications that were interpreted as signaling a more gradual pace of policy easing than previously thought the rise at short maturities reflected increases in both real yields and inflation compensation while the rise at longer maturities was primarily driven by increases in real yields broad equity prices also rose over the period likely reflecting in part the solid incoming data and consequent lower odds of a weakening in the economic outlook the vix which measures day optionimplied volatility of broad equity prices had moved higher in the period leading up to the november elections and then decreased following election day the manager noted that the federal funds rate path had shifted up notably over the period as measured by both the optionsimplied modal path and the futuresimplied average path although the futuresimplied path remained below the optionsimplied path at longer horizons the gap between the two paths narrowed likely reflecting market participants judgment that risks had become less skewed toward the downside in the open market desks survey of primary dealers and survey of market participants a large majority of respondents had a modal expectation of a basis point cut at this meeting and another basis point cut at the december meeting further out there was considerably more uncertainty for example although the mean of the average respondents probability distribution for the federal funds rate at the trough of this easing cycle was close to the average respondents expected longerrun level of the federal funds rate respondents placed substantial weight on a wide range of outcomes the manager also discussed balance sheet policy expectations the average of the survey responses indicated that the modal expectation regarding the timing of the end of balance sheet runoff had the federal open market committee is referenced as the fomc and the committee in these minutes the board of governors of the federal reserve system is referenced as the board in these minutes november shifted a bit later to may these responses remained dispersed though roughly twothirds of respondents expected an end to runoff in either the first or the second quarter of survey results indicated that respondents expected balance sheet runoff to continue alongside rate cuts for several more months the surveys therefore suggested that the committees two policy toolsthe policy rate and the balance sheetwere not seen as working at crosspurposes regarding international developments the manager noted that policy rate expectations for the year end declined in most advanced foreign economies afes with the exception of australia and the uk the widening of differentials with us interest rates had likely contributed to an increase in the trade weighted dollar index which reached its highest level this year the manager then turned to money markets and desk operations unsecured overnight rates remained stable over the intermeeting period in secured funding markets rates on overnight repurchase agreements repo increased sharply and were volatile around the september quarterend but on other dates generally stayed just above the rate offered at the overnight reverse repurchase agreement on rrp facility market contacts attributed the pressures seen around the quarterend to a combination of typical balance sheet constraints associated with financial reporting dates and a large net settlement of treasury coupon securities that took place on the same day overall developments in the repo market at the end of september and in early october appeared to conform with the typical quarterend pattern although the spike in repo rates observed on those days was the largest in the postpandemic period the september quarterend also saw the first nontest use of the standing repo facility srf with two counterparties borrowing billion the manager noted that the relatively small utilization was not surprising as repo rates in the noncentrally cleared segment of the triparty repo marketin which the facility operatesdid not exceed the srf rate for the most part the manager also observed that there was a substantial volume of trades taking place above the srf rate around quarterend in other segments of the repo market the manager indicated that with dealers typically earning a spread in their intermediation activity this outcome was not surprising the manager suggested that considerations related to market structure also helped explain why repo rates were above the srf rate in those segments at quarterend overall the manager judged that the srf performed about in line with the desks expectations usage of the on rrp facility declined about billion over the intermeeting period this decline appeared to be driven primarily by additional net treasury bill supply in recent weeks which made treasury bill yields more attractive the manager also noted that of late the largest on rrp participants had substantially reduced their participation at the facility leading to a less concentrated configuration of on rrp takeup than had been the case for some time minutes of the federal open market committee over the intermeeting period pricing in the federal funds market continued to be insensitive to dayto day changes in the supply of reserves the manager noted that this outcome was consistent with reserves remaining abundant and that various other indicators pointed to the same conclusion the staff also provided an informational briefing to the committee on two considerations related to the management of the balance sheet over the near term the first consideration focused on the possibility of a technical adjustment to the on rrp offering rate the staff reviewed developments with respect to the usage of the on rrp facility the staff also noted that lowering the on rrp offering rate basis points would align the on rrp offering rate with the bottom of the target range for the federal funds rate and would probably put some downward pressure on other money market rates the second consideration focused on the possible implications for the composition of federal reserve liabilities stemming from the federal debt limit potentially being reinstated in the staff presentation highlighted the fact that should this event occur a drawdown in the treasury general account tga balances would increase the sum of reserves and on rrp balances and that a subsequent rebuilding of tga balances would have the reverse effect the staff noted that these substantial shifts could mask the effects of ongoing balance sheet runoff on money market conditions and pose challenges in assessing reserve conditions by unanimous vote the committee ratified the desks domestic transactions over the intermeeting period there were no intervention operations in foreign currencies for the systems account during the intermeeting period staff review of the economic situation the information available at the time of the meeting indicated that real gross domestic product gdp had expanded solidly so far this year the pace of job gains had moderated since the beginning of the year and the unemployment rate had moved up on net but remained low consumer price inflation was well below its yearearlier pace consumer price inflationas measured by the month change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures pcehad moved lower in august and september total pce price inflation was percent in september and core pce price inflationwhich excludes changes in energy prices and many consumer food priceswas percent recent data suggested that labor market conditions remained solid average monthly nonfarm payroll gains in the third quarter were similar to those seen in the second quarter october job gains were held down noticeably by the effects of strikes and hurricanes the unemployment rate had edged down slightly since august and was percent in october the labor force participation rate also november ticked down over this period and the employmenttopopulation ratio was unchanged on net the unemployment rates for african americans and for hispanics moved down both rates were above those for asians and for whites the ratio of job vacancies to unemployment was in october slightly lower than its level just before the pandemic average hourly earnings for all employees rose percent over the months ending in october down percentage point relative to a year earlier and the month change in the employment cost index of hourly compensation for private industry workers was percent in september down percentage point from its yearearlier pace according to the advance release real gdp posted a solid gain in the third quarter that was similar to its secondquarter pace real private domestic final purchaseswhich comprises pce and private fixed investment and which often provides a better signal than gdp of underlying economic momentumrose slightly faster than real gdp in the third quarter net exports were a drag on third quarter real gdp growth as a brisk rise in exports was outpaced by even faster import growth real gdp growth in foreign economies picked up somewhat in the third quarter including in the euro area and especially mexico in china growth also firmed in the third quarter and there were signs that recent fiscal stimulus measures were starting to shore up confidence that said more recent indicators such as purchasing managers indexes pmis continued to suggest ongoing weakness in foreign manufacturing in part due to monetary policies still being restrictive inflation abroad continued to ease in the advanced afes excluding japan month headline inflation slowed to near or below target levels mainly reflecting the rapid passthrough of lower energy prices earlier this year at the same time services inflation remained high in these economies in china core inflation fell to its lowest level since the global financial crisis by contrast in some latin american countries notably brazil inflation increased partly because of renewed food price pressures many foreign central banks eased policy during the intermeeting period including the bank of canada and the european central bank among the afes and the central banks of colombia mexico korea the philippines and thailand among the emerging market economies staff review of the financial situation the expected path of the federal funds rate implied by financial market quotes increased notably over the intermeeting period amid strongerthanexpected data releases pertaining to economic activity somewhat higherthanexpected readings on inflation and comments by some fomc participants that were interpreted as signaling a more gradual approach to recalibrating the stance of monetary policy consistent with a higher expected path of the federal funds rate and a shift in investors perceptions of the balance of risks nominal treasury yields across the maturity spectrum increased significantly minutes of the federal open market committee the increase in longerterm yields appeared to be mostly attributable to higher term premiums consistent with investors perceived shift in the balance of risks away from outcomes characterized by slower real gdp growth and lower inflation marketbased measures of inflation compensation moved up over the period from relatively low levels while surveybased measures of longerterm inflation expectations were little changed these measures continued to suggest an expectation that inflation would return over time to the committees percent objective despite higher yields and amid greater confidence about the growth outlook and somewhat better thanexpected corporate earnings reports broad equity price indexes increased notably on net over the intermeeting period and credit spreads for both corporate and municipal bonds narrowed the vix rose appreciably reportedly reflecting uncertainty about the outcome of the us presidential election and escalating tensions in the middle east however it subsequently more than retraced those increases ending the period moderately lower and slightly below the median of its historical distribution conditions in us shortterm funding markets remained generally stable over the intermeeting period with the lowering of the target range for the federal funds rate in september fully passing through to both secured and unsecured reference rates rates in secured markets exhibited significant but temporary upward pressure around the september quarterend driven by typical quarterend dynamics and a large net treasury coupon settlement over the intermeeting period government money market funds mmfs continued to increase allocations to treasury bills and private repo in light of the generally favorable rates on these instruments usage of the on rrp facility declined significantly over the period over the intermeeting period foreign financial markets were driven by greater investor confidence in the us economic outlook foreign economic data releases and political developments higher us treasury yields spilled over to foreign yields across the curve though softerthanexpected inflation and pmi survey data weighed on shortterm yields in the euro area in the uk yields increased following the release of the new governments budget as market participants processed the budgets impact on projected inflation and gilt issuance the broad dollar index increased significantly as us interest rates rose more than foreign rates in china the announcement of new policy stimulus measures boosted domestic risky asset prices with limited spillovers to other markets the announcements also drove notable flows into chinafocused investment funds most european equity price indexes decreased somewhat while japanese and canadian equity markets rose moderately in domestic credit markets borrowing costs for households and most businesses rose over the intermeeting period from already elevated levels primarily reflecting increases in longerterm treasury yields rates on year fixedrate conforming residential mortgages rose while interest rates on november credit cards remained relatively unchanged at near historical highs by contrast interest rates on new auto loans edged down but remained elevated meanwhile interest rates on commercial and industrial ci loans and small business loans continued to be elevated yields also rose on an array of fixedincome securities including commercial mortgagebacked securities cmbs investment and speculativegrade corporate bonds and residential mortgagebacked securities over the intermeeting period financing through capital markets and nonbank lenders remained broadly available for public corporations and for large and midsize private corporations for smaller firms however credit availability remained relatively tight in the october senior loan officer opinion survey on bank lending practices sloos banks on net reported maintaining their lending standards and most terms basically unchanged for ci loans meanwhile net growth in ci loan balances remained subdued in august and september with respect to commercial real estate cre loans banks in the october sloos reported on balance basically unchanged lending standards for all categories of cre loans the first survey since early in which standards on cre loans of every category have not tightened bank cre loan balances were flat in the third quarter partly reflecting lending standards staying on the tighter end of the range prevailing since credit remained available for most consumers although consumer credit availability continued to tighten moderately through september credit card balances expanded modestly in the third quarter while auto credit growth continued to slow through august in the october sloos respondents on net indicated that standards for credit cards tightened but most of them reported no change in lending standards for auto loans access to credit in the residential mortgage market was little changed on balance and continued to depend on borrowers credit risk attributes in the october sloos banks on net moderately eased residential lending standards credit quality remained solid in the cases of large and midsize firms most home mortgage borrowers and municipalities but it continued to deteriorate in other sectors the credit quality of nonfinancial firms borrowing in the corporate bond and leveraged loan markets remained stable delinquency rates on loans to small businesses remained modestly above prepandemic levels credit quality in the cre market deteriorated further with the average delinquency rate on loans in cmbs pools rising further in september driven largely by office loans regarding household credit quality delinquency rates on most residential mortgages were largely unchanged in september at about their historical low delinquency rates for credit cards increased a bit further in the third quarter while delinquency rates on auto loans inched down the sloos results reported are based on banks responses weighted by each banks outstanding loans in the respective loan category and might therefore differ from the results reported in the published sloos which are based on banks unweighted responses minutes of the federal open market committee the staff provided an update on its assessment of the stability of the us financial system and on balance continued to characterize the systems financial vulnerabilities as notable the staff judged that asset valuation pressures were elevated with estimates of risk premiums across key markets low by historical standards house prices remained elevated relative to fundamentals such as rents although the pace of decline in cre prices slowed fundamentals continued to deteriorate across multiple categories vulnerabilities associated with business and household debt were characterized as moderate nonfinancial business leverage was elevated by historical standards but the ability of publicly traded firms to service their debt remained strong supported by robust earnings and the low interest rates that firms continued to enjoy on the portion of fixedrate debt issued early in the pandemic that said the fraction of private firm debt having very low interest coverage ratios continued to increase pointing to further deterioration in the balance sheets of riskier firms household balance sheets remained solid overall as aggregate home equity remained high and delinquencies on mortgage loans continued to be low vulnerabilities associated with leverage in the financial sector were characterized as notable regulatory capital ratios in the banking sector remained high however banks continued to hold large quantities of longduration assets leaving them more exposed than usual to an unexpected rise in longerterm interest rates in the nonbank sector leverage at hedge funds remained high partly on account of the prevalence of the treasury cashfutures basis trade life insurers leverage remained somewhat elevated and they continued to maintain large holdings of risky and illiquid securities by contrast brokerdealer leverage remained low as their capital increased in line with their assets vulnerabilities associated with funding risks were also characterized as notable assets in prime mmfs and other runnable cashmanagement vehicles remained near historical highs life insurers greater reliance on nontraditional liabilities suggested that adverse shocks to the industry could trigger substantial funding pressures at these firms staff economic outlook the staff forecast at the november meeting called for economic conditions to remain solid relative to september the real gdp growth projection for as a whole was higher reflecting stronger thanexpected spending and labor market indicators the staff had revised up their assessment of potential output growth in light of the upward revisions to productivity implied by the recent annual update of the national income and product accounts from to real gdp growth was expected to be slightly slower than potential output growth resulting in a very small increase in the unemployment rate november the staffs inflation forecast for was slightly higher than the one prepared for the previous meeting reflecting incoming data thereafter the outlook was similar to the previous projection both total and core pce price inflation were expected to decline further as supply and demand in labor and product markets continued to move into better balance by total and core inflation were expected to be percent the staff continued to view the uncertainty around the baseline projection as close to the average over the past years the staff had reduced its assessment of the downward risks to the baseline forecast for economic activity in light of incoming data nevertheless the staff judged that these risks were somewhat skewed to the downside although current labor market conditions remained solid it was possible that the easing in the labor market seen over the past two years could give way to a more pronounced slowdown in economic activity the risks around the inflation forecast were seen as roughly balanced participants views on current conditions and the economic outlook in their discussion of inflation developments participants continued to observe that inflation had eased substantially from its peak although core inflation remained somewhat elevated almost all participants judged that though monthtomonth movements would remain volatile incoming data generally remained consistent with inflation returning sustainably to percent participants commented that disinflationary progress had been seen across a broad range of core goods and services prices notably in both the core goods and nonhousing services categories prices were now increasing at rates close to those seen during earlier periods of price stability many participants noted that the slowing in these components of core inflation corroborated reports received from their business contacts that firms were more reluctant to increase prices as consumers appeared to be more price sensitive and were increasingly seeking discounts some participants remarked that although increases in housing services prices remained somewhat elevated they continued to expect that these increases would slow as the more subdued pace of rent increases faced by new tenants would eventually be reflected further in housing services prices with regard to the outlook for inflation participants indicated that they remained confident that inflation was moving sustainably toward percent although a couple noted the possibility that the process could take longer than previously expected a few participants remarked that insofar as recent robust increases in real gdp reflected favorable supply developments the strength of economic activity was unlikely to be a source of upward inflation pressures participants cited various factors likely to put continuing downward pressure on inflation including waning business pricing power the committees stillrestrictive monetary policy stance and wellanchored longerterm inflation expectations several participants noted that nominal wage growth had continued to move down and minutes of the federal open market committee that the wage premium available to job switchers had diminished in addition some participants observed that with supply and demand in the labor market being roughly in balance and in light of recent productivity gains wage increases were unlikely to be a source of inflationary pressure in the near future in discussing labor market developments participants generally viewed recent readings as consistent with labor market conditions remaining solid although labor strikes and the devastating hurricanes had been important sources of temporary fluctuations in the employment data participants continued to cite declines in job vacancies the quits rate and turnover as consistent with a gradual easing in labor demand some participants reported that businesses were becoming more selective in hiring as they faced larger pools of more qualified job applicants and job applicants were more willing to accept less accommodative work arrangements and more moderate wage offers participants generally noted however that there was no sign of rapid deterioration in labor market conditions with layoffs remaining low a few participants cited business contacts who were using attrition instead of layoffs to manage the size of their workforce some participants observed that the evaluation of underlying trends in labor market developments had continued to be challenging with difficulties in measuring the effects of immigration on labor supply revisions to data and the effects of natural disasters and labor strikes among the factors cited as complicating this evaluationand that assessments of the outlook for the labor market were associated with considerable uncertainty participants generally judged that current labor market conditions were broadly consistent with the committees longerrun goal of maximum employment with regard to the outlook for the labor market participants generally anticipated that with an appropriate recalibration of the committees monetary policy stance over time the labor market would remain solid participants generally agreed that labor market indicators merited close monitoring some participants still saw elevated risks that the labor market could deteriorate though many participants saw the risk of an excessive cooling in the labor market as having diminished somewhat since the committees september meeting participants observed that recent data on economic activity and consumer spending were largely stronger than anticipated and they assessed that economic activity had continued to expand at a solid pace and consumer spending remained strong participants remarked that consumption had been supported by a solid labor market rising real wages and elevated household wealth many participants observed that recent upward revisions in data on household income and the saving rate had made these series behavior more consistent with the strength in consumer spending however several participants cautioned that low and moderateincome households continued to experience financial strains which could damp their spending a couple of participants cited recent increases in rates of delinquencies on credit card borrowing and automobile loans as signs of such strains november regarding the business sector a few participants noted that favorable aggregate supply developmentsincluding increases in labor supply business investment and productivitycontinued to support solid expansion of business activity a couple of participants remarked that there was considerable uncertainty about the durability of recent rates of increase in productivity although a few participants attributed some of the productivity gains to potentially transitory factorssuch as one time efficiency gains in response to earlier labor shortagesor the possible underestimation of labor inputs some participants highlighted more durable factors such as new business formation and investment as well as the integration into the workplace of technological advances a couple of participants discussed some of these recent trends noting especially possible implications of the expanded use of artificial intelligence in the workplace several participants indicated that their district contacts reported larger corporations and firms in sectors like financial services construction professional services and technology as having a generally more optimistic outlook than smaller businesses or firms in the manufacturing sector several participants remarked that the agricultural sector continued to face significant strains due to low crop prices and high input costs in participants evaluation of the risks and uncertainties associated with the economic outlook upside risks to the inflation outlook were seen as little changed while downside risks to employment and growth were seen as having decreased somewhat among the upside risks to inflation cited by participants were the possibility of sudden disruptions in global supply chains due to geopolitical developments a largerthananticipated easing in financial conditions strongerthanexpected consumption morepersistent shelter price increases or sharp rises in insurance charges for health autos or homes some participants pointed to various downside risks to economic activity and employment including weaker global growth sharply worsening financing conditions due to an escalation of geopolitical tensions or a sizable asset price correction or an unwelcome weakening of the labor market almost all participants judged the risks to the attainment of their dualmandate objectives of maximum employment and price stability to be roughly in balance in their discussion of financial stability participants who commented noted vulnerabilities to the financial system that they assessed warranted monitoring a couple of participants observed that the banking system was sound but that there continued to be potential risks associated with unrealized losses on bank assets many participants discussed vulnerabilities associated with cre exposures focusing on risks in the office sector a few of these participants noted signs that the deterioration of conditions in this sector of the cre market might be lessening a couple of participants noted concerns about asset valuation pressures in other markets some participants commented on cyber risks that could impair the operation of financial institutions financial infrastructure and potentially the overall economy these participants noted in particular vulnerabilities that could emanate from thirdparty service providers a couple of participants also mentioned thirdparty service providers in minutes of the federal open market committee the context of risks associated with brokered and reciprocal deposit arrangements several participants noted that leverage in the market for treasury securities remained a risk and commented that it would be important to monitor developments regarding the markets resilience a few participants discussed vulnerabilities posed by the growth of private credit and potential links to banks and other financial institutions a couple of participants commented on the financial condition of low and moderateincome households that have exhausted their savings and the importance of monitoring rising delinquency rates on credit cards and auto loans a couple of participants remarked on the successful implementation of the securities and exchange commissions money fund rules noting that it would reduce financial stability risks posed by domestic mmfs in their consideration of monetary policy at this meeting participants noted that inflation had made progress toward the committees objective but remained somewhat elevated participants also observed that recent indicators suggested that economic activity had continued to expand at a solid pace labor market conditions had generally eased since earlier in the year and the unemployment rate had moved up but remained low almost all participants judged that the risks to achieving the committees employment and inflation goals were roughly in balance in support of the committees goals all participants viewed it as appropriate to lower the target range for the federal funds rate by basis points to to percent participants observed that such a further recalibration of the monetary policy stance would help maintain the strength in the economy and the labor market while continuing to enable further progress on inflation participants judged that it was appropriate to continue the process of reducing the federal reserves securities holdings in discussing the outlook for monetary policy participants anticipated that if the data came in about as expected with inflation continuing to move down sustainably to percent and the economy remaining near maximum employment it would likely be appropriate to move gradually toward a more neutral stance of policy over time participants noted that monetary policy decisions were not on a preset course and were conditional on the evolution of the economy and the implications for the economic outlook and the balance of risks they stressed that it would be important for the committee to make this clear as it adjusted its policy stance while emphasizing that monetary policy would be data dependent many participants noted the volatility of recent economic data and highlighted the importance of focusing on underlying economic trends and the evolution of the outlook when assessing incoming information some participants remarked that at a future meeting there would be value in the committee considering a technical adjustment to the rate offered at the on rrp facility to set the rate equal to the bottom of the target range for the federal funds rate thereby bringing the rate back into an alignment that had existed when the facility was established as a monetary policy tool november in discussing riskmanagement considerations that could bear on the outlook for monetary policy almost all participants agreed that risks to achieving the committees employment and inflation goals remained roughly in balance some participants judged that downside risks to economic activity or the labor market had diminished participants noted that monetary policy would need to balance the risks of easing policy too quickly thereby possibly hindering further progress on inflation with the risks of easing policy too slowly thereby unduly weakening economic activity and employment in discussing the positioning of monetary policy in response to potential changes in the balance of risks some participants noted that the committee could pause its easing of the policy rate and hold it at a restrictive level if inflation remained elevated and some remarked that policy easing could be accelerated if the labor market turned down or economic activity faltered many participants observed that uncertainties concerning the level of the neutral rate of interest complicated the assessment of the degree of restrictiveness of monetary policy and in their view made it appropriate to reduce policy restraint gradually committee policy actions in their discussions of monetary policy for this meeting members agreed that economic activity had continued to expand at a solid pace labor market conditions had generally eased since earlier in the year and the unemployment rate had moved up but remained low members concurred that inflation had made progress toward the committees percent inflation objective but that inflation remained somewhat elevated in discussing the committees statement members agreed that it was appropriate to omit the previous reference to their greater confidence that inflation was moving sustainably toward percent as this language had been specifically associated with the commencement of policy easing in september and therefore was no longer needed almost all members agreed that the risks to achieving the committees employment and inflation goals were roughly in balance members viewed the economic outlook as uncertain and agreed that they were attentive to the risks to both sides of the committees dual mandate in support of its goals the committee decided to lower the target range for the federal funds rate by basis points to to percent members concurred that in considering additional adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate they would carefully assess incoming data the evolving outlook and the balance of risks members agreed to continue to reduce the federal reserves holdings of treasury securities and agency debt and agency mortgagebacked securities all members agreed that the postmeeting statement should affirm their strong commitment both to supporting maximum employment and to returning inflation to the committees percent objective members agreed that in assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy they would continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook they would be prepared to minutes of the federal open market committee adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerged that could impede the attainment of the committees goals members also agreed that their assessments would take into account a wide range of information including readings on labor market conditions inflation pressures and inflation expectations and financial and international developments at the conclusion of the discussion the committee voted to direct the federal reserve bank of new york until instructed otherwise to execute transactions in the system open market account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive for release at pm effective november the federal open market committee directs the desk to undertake open market operations as necessary to maintain the federal funds rate in a target range of to percent conduct

payments are less than the monthly cap reinvest the amount of principal payments from the federal reserves holdings of agency debt and agency mortgagebacked securities mbs received in each calendar month that exceeds a cap of billion per month into treasury securities to roughly match the maturity composition of treasury securities outstanding allow modest deviations from stated amounts for reinvestments if needed for operational reasons engage in dollar roll and coupon swap transactions as necessary to facilitate settlement of the federal reserves agency mbs transactions the vote also encompassed approval of the statement below for release at pm recent indicators suggest that economic activity has continued to expand at a solid pace since earlier in the year labor market conditions have generally eased and the unemployment rate has moved up but remains low inflation has made progress toward the committees percent objective but remains somewhat elevated november the committee seeks to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of percent over the longer run the committee judges that the risks to achieving its employment and inflation goals are roughly in balance the economic outlook is uncertain and the committee is attentive to the risks to both sides of its dual mandate in support of its goals the committee decided to lower the target range for the federal funds rate by percentage point to to percent in considering additional adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate the committee will carefully assess incoming data the evolving outlook and the balance of risks the committee will continue reducing its holdings of treasury securities and agency debt and agency mortgagebacked securities the committee is strongly committed to supporting

2024,fomcminutes20241218.pdf,fomc federal reserve system minutes of the federal open market committee december minutes of the federal open market committee december a joint meeting of the federal open market committee and the board of governors of the federal reserve system was held in the offices of the board of governors on tuesday december at am and continued on wednesday december at am developments in financial markets and open market operations the manager turned first to a review of developments in financial markets nominal treasury yields fluctuated over the intermeeting period and were slightly higher on net than in early november treasury yields had risen notably since their trough in midseptember with the rise in the year nominal yield driven largely by increases in real yields liquidity in treasury markets deteriorated somewhat following the us election but remained well within the ranges observed over the past three years with nearterm measures of inflation compensation a little higher over the intermeeting period and longerterm measures little changed the manager noted that there were few signs of concern about persistent inflationary pressures in market prices equity prices largely sustained the gains that they had experienced in anticipation of and immediately following the us election the manager noted that market expectations for the path of the federal funds rate were little changed over the intermeeting period markets had almost fully priced in a basis point cut in the target range for the federal funds rate at this meeting and all respondents from the open market desks survey of primary dealers and survey of market participants expected the same survey respondents anticipated that the pace of rate cuts would slow considerably in with the median respondent expecting basis points of cuts for the full year options and futures prices suggested a somewhat lower level of expected policy easing in however in discussing both survey and market expectations the manager noted that there was considerable uncertainty among market participants about the path of the federal funds rate in the year ahead the manager also discussed balance sheet policy expectations the average estimate of survey respondents for the timing of the end of balance sheet runoff shifted a bit later to june this shift mainly reflected revisions to estimates by respondents who had expected balance sheet runoff to end in the last quarter of or in early the federal open market committee is referenced as the fomc and the committee in these minutes the board of governors of the federal reserve system is referenced as the board in these minutes december regarding international developments the manager noted that market participants expected central banks in nearly all advanced foreign economies afes to continue to reduce their policy rates in in contrast to the us market expectations for policy rates at the end of in most afes had shifted lower over the intermeeting period the manager noted that this widening between us and foreign interest rates appeared to be a major contributor to the increase in the tradeweighted us dollar index observed over the intermeeting period the manager then turned to money markets and desk operations unsecured overnight rates had remained stable over the intermeeting period and with the exception of temporary pressures around monthend and treasury auction settlement dates rates on overnight repurchase agreements repo were little changed the manager noted that on average market participants appeared to be expecting upward pressure in repo markets around yearend comparable with that seen at the september quarterend based on term and forwardsettling repo volumes market participants appeared to have been more proactive than in recent years in preparing for the yearend which the manager judged could help mitigate somewhat the extent of upward pressure on repo rates during that time pricing in the federal funds market continued to be insensitive to daytoday changes in the supply of reserves over the intermeeting period the manager noted that this outcome was consistent with reserves remaining abundant and that various other indicators as well as responses about banks desired reserve levels from the federal reserves senior financial officer survey pointed to the same conclusion looking ahead the manager raised the possibility that the potential reinstatement of the debt limit in could result in substantial shifts in federal reserve liabilities that could pose challenges in assessing reserve conditions usage of the overnight reverse repurchase agreement on rrp facility continued its decline over the intermeeting period the recent decrease in on rrp usage was attributable in part to increases in net treasury bill issuance which made treasury bill rates more attractive in the near term the manager judged that on rrp volumes were likely to rise because of an expected decline in net treasury bill issuance and typical yearend dynamics the manager also noted that the potential reinstatement of the debt limit could keep on rrp balances elevated for some time in the manager discussed market expectations regarding a technical adjustment that would lower the on rrp offering rate to the bottom of the target range for the federal funds rate based on the desk surveys and market outreach most market participants expected such an adjustment at this meeting market participants views varied on how much downward pressure this adjustment would put on money market rates but repo rates were generally expected to fall more than the federal funds rate minutes of the federal open market committee the manager concluded by noting that the desk was planning to add a second standing repo facility srf auction on each day of the week spanning yearend the manager viewed these additional auctions as technical exercises that could improve the federal reserves understanding of how srf auction times can support effective policy implementation and market functioning during periods of expected money market pressures by unanimous vote the committee ratified the desks domestic transactions over the intermeeting period there were no intervention operations in foreign currencies for the systems account during the intermeeting period staff review of the economic situation the information available at the time of the meeting indicated that real gross domestic product gdp had continued to expand at a solid pace in labor market conditions had eased since early but the unemployment rate remained low consumer price inflation was below its yearearlier rate but was still somewhat elevated total consumer price inflationas measured by the month change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures pcewas percent in october below the percent rate seen a year earlier core pce price inflationwhich excludes changes in consumer energy prices and many consumer food priceswas percent in october lower than its percent rate a year earlier in november the month change in the consumer price index cpi was percent and core cpi inflation was percent both were below their yearearlier rates given both the cpi and producer price index data the staff estimated that total pce price inflation would be reported as percent over the months ending in november and that core pce price inflation would be percent recent data suggested that labor market conditions had eased slightly further but remained solid average monthly nonfarm payroll gains over october and november were a little below their pace in the third quarter the staff estimated that job gains were held down by the effects of labor strikes and hurricanes in october and were boosted by a similar amount in november after those effects unwound the unemployment rate ticked up to percent in november and both the labor force participation rate and the employmenttopopulation ratio moved down a bit further the unemployment rates for african americans and for hispanics also moved up and both rates were above those for asians and for whites the ratio of job vacancies to unemployment held steady at in november slightly lower than its level just before the pandemic average hourly earnings for all employees rose percent over the months ending in novemberthe same rate as in the previous month real gdp posted a solid gain in the third quarter that was similar to its secondquarter pace real private domestic final purchases pdfpwhich comprises pce and private fixed investment and december which often provides a better signal than gdp of underlying economic momentumrose faster than real gdp in the third quarter exports rose briskly in the third quarter import growth was even faster in the fourth quarter available economic indicators suggested that real gdp growth remained solid with growth of real pdfp still outpacing that of real gdp imports fell more than exports in october with real imports of capital goods dropping back after brisk growth earlier in the year foreign economic growth picked up in the third quarter notably in the euro area and in mexico recent economic indicators however suggested much weaker momentum in foreign economies in the fourth quarter with lackluster manufacturing activity and subdued private consumption spending in china growth in retail sales slowed suggesting that domestic demand remained weak strength in hightech goods production continued abroad mainly in asia excluding china supported by buoyant us demand inflation in foreign economies continued to ease in most afes headline inflation slowed to near or below target levels mainly reflecting the passthrough of lower energy prices earlier in the year services inflation however remained high in some of those economies in china inflation remained close to zero in part due to falling food prices by contrast in some latin american countries most notably brazil inflation continued to increase partly because of currency depreciation staff review of the financial situation the marketimplied path of the federal funds rate over the next year edged higher on net since the us election as investors assessed the implications of incoming inflation data and potential economic policy changes for the nearterm economic outlook communications by federal reserve officials contributed to investors perceptions of a slower timeline for policy rate reductions nominal treasury yields across the maturity spectrum initially increased but then reversed those increases ending the intermeeting period little changed measures of nearterm inflation compensation moved up while those of longerterm inflation compensation were little changed broad equity prices rose with more pronounced increases in stock prices in cyclical sectors amid increased investor optimism for corporate profits and highyield bond spreads narrowed the vixa forwardlooking measure of nearterm equity market volatilityfell notably and remained well below preelection levels foreign financial market pricing reflected weakerthanexpected foreign data releases expectations of further policy easing by foreign central banks and potential changes in us trade policy accordingly foreign bond yields generally declined relative to their us counterparts contributing to dollar appreciation against most foreign currencies foreign equities generally underperformed us equities in part reflecting investors expectations of economic growth diverging further between the us and the rest of the world minutes of the federal open market committee many foreign central banks eased their policy rates during the intermeeting period including the bank of canada the european central bank and the swiss national bank among the afes and the central banks of hong kong india korea and mexico among the emerging market economies an exception was the central bank of brazil which increased its policy rate basis points and signaled further hikes in the face of inflationary pressures conditions in us shortterm funding markets remained generally stable over the intermeeting period with the lowering of the target range for the federal funds rate in november fully passing through to both secured and unsecured reference rates money market funds mmfs usage of the on rrp facility was lower on average than in the previous intermeeting period reflecting increased holdings of treasury bills amid sizable net bill issuance overall mmf assets under management stayed near record highs spreads of unsecured commercial paper maturing over yearend remained within typical ranges and global offshore dollar funding markets continued to be stable in domestic markets borrowing costs for households businesses and municipalities remained elevated despite small declines in most credit segments rates on year fixedrate conforming residential mortgages declined but stayed elevated interest rates on credit cards and new auto loans continued to be at historical highs although interest rates on new auto loans decreased further borrowing costs for leveraged loan borrowers declined slightly interest rates on newly originated commercial and industrial ci loans ticked down in the third quarter and interest rates on short term loans to small businesses remained unchanged yields on an array of fixedincome securities including investment and speculativegrade corporate bonds and commercial mortgagebacked securities cmbs decreased slightly but remained elevated financing in capital markets continued to be broadly available for largetomidsize businesses and municipalities for small businesses however credit availability remained relatively tight and loan originations stayed subdued in october ci loans by banks increased moderately in october and were flat through november after modest growth in the third quarter after stalling in the third quarter commercial real estate cre loan growth picked up moderately in october and remained subdued through late november meanwhile agency cmbs issuance continued to be weak in october while nonagency cmbs issuance was strong in october and in the first three weeks of november reflecting a high volume of refinancing activity credit continued to be generally available for most households even so auto loans were little changed in the third quarter and growth of revolving credit was weak into november credit in the residential mortgage market continued to be readily available for highcreditscore borrowers while credit availability for lowcreditscore borrowers improved on net over the six months through october december credit quality remained solid for largetomidsize firms municipalities and most home mortgage borrowers the credit performance of corporate bonds and leveraged loans was generally stable at banks delinquency rates on ci loans were stable and remained within the range observed over the past decade delinquency rates on small business loans continued to increase through october as did delinquencies on small business credit cards through september in cre markets credit performance deteriorated further as aggregate cmbs delinquency rates rose through october driven by delinquencies on office loans at banks delinquency rates on cre loans ticked up through september from already elevated levels regarding household credit quality delinquency rates on most residential mortgages were largely unchanged and stood near historical lows however the delinquency rate on federal housing administration mortgages which are disproportionately used by borrowers with lower credit scores and smaller down payments remained above prepandemic levels delinquency rates on credit cards continued to increase albeit at a slower pace than earlier in the year while delinquency rates on auto loans were unchanged staff economic outlook the staff projection at the december meeting was for economic conditions to stay solid given the elevated uncertainty regarding specifics about the scope and timing of potential changes to trade immigration fiscal and regulatory policies and their potential effects on the economy the staff highlighted the difficulty of selecting and assessing the importance of such factors for the baseline projection and featured a number of alternative scenarios after incorporating the recent data and preliminary placeholder assumptions about potential policy changes real gdp growth was projected to be slightly slower than in the previous baseline forecast and the unemployment rate was expected to be a bit higher but to remain near the staffs estimate of its natural rate in the staffs baseline projection the inflation forecast for was slightly higher than the one prepared for the previous meeting reflecting upside surprises in some recent data inflation in was expected to remain at about the same rate as in as the effects of the staffs placeholder trade policy assumptions held inflation up thereafter inflation was forecast to decline to percent by the same as in the projection at the november meeting the staff continued to view the uncertainty around the baseline projection as within the range seen over the past years a period that encompassed a number of episodes during which uncertainty about the economy and federal policy changes was elevated the staff judged that the risks around the baseline forecasts for employment and real gdp growth were balanced as concerns about downside risks from a marked cooling in labor market conditions had eased in recent months the risks around the inflation forecast were seen as tilted to the upside as core inflation had not come minutes of the federal open market committee down as much as expected in and the effects of trade policy changes could be larger than the staff had assumed participants views on current conditions and the economic outlook in conjunction with this fomc meeting participants submitted their projections of the most likely outcomes for real gdp growth the unemployment rate and inflation for each year from through and over the longer run these projections were based on participants individual assessments of appropriate monetary policy including their projections of the federal funds rate the longerrun projections represented each participants assessment of the rate to which each variable would tend to converge under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy the summary of economic projections was released to the public after the meeting in their discussion of inflation developments participants noted that although inflation had eased substantially from its peak in it remained somewhat elevated participants commented that the overall pace of disinflation had slowed over and that some recent monthly price readings had been higher than anticipated nevertheless most remarked that disinflationary progress continued to be apparent across a broad range of core goods and services prices notably some participants observed that in the core goods and marketbased core services categories excluding housing prices were increasing at rates close to those seen during earlier periods of price stability many participants noted that the slowing in these components of inflation corroborated reports received from their business contacts that firms were more reluctant to increase prices as consumers appeared to be more price sensitive and were increasingly seeking discounts with respect to core services prices a majority of participants remarked that increases in some components had exceeded expectations over recent months many noted however that the increases were concentrated largely in nonmarket based price categories and that price movements in such categories typically have not provided reliable signals about resource pressures or the future trajectory of inflation most participants also remarked that increases in housing services prices remained somewhat elevated though they continued to slow gradually as the pace of rent increases for new tenants continued to moderate and would eventually be reflected further in housing services prices with regard to the outlook for inflation participants expected that inflation would continue to move toward percent although they noted that recent higherthanexpected readings on inflation and the effects of potential changes in trade and immigration policy suggested that the process could take longer than previously anticipated several observed that the disinflationary process may have stalled temporarily or noted the risk that it could a couple of participants judged that positive sentiment in financial markets and momentum in economic activity could continue to put upward pressure on inflation all participants judged that uncertainty about the scope timing and economic effects of december potential changes in policies affecting foreign trade and immigration was elevated reflecting that uncertainty participants took varied approaches in accounting for these effects a number of participants indicated that they incorporated placeholder assumptions to one degree or another into their projections other participants indicated that they did not incorporate such assumptions and a few participants did not indicate whether they incorporated such assumptions several participants remarked that insofar as recent solid increases in real gdp reflected favorable supply developments the strength of economic activity was unlikely to be a source of upward inflation pressures participants cited various factors as being likely to put continuing downward pressure on inflation including waning business pricing power the committees stillrestrictive monetary policy stance and wellanchored longerterm inflation expectations some participants noted that nominal wage growth had continued to move down further several observed that with supply and demand in the labor market being roughly in balance and in light of recent productivity gains labor market conditions were unlikely to be a source of inflationary pressure in the near future however several remarked that nominal wage growth remained slightly above the pace likely to be consistent over time with percent inflation in discussing labor market developments participants viewed recent readings on a range of indicators as consistent with an ongoing gradual easing in labor market conditions even as the unemployment rate remained low participants cited declines in job vacancies the quits rate the rate at which the unemployed were obtaining jobs and turnover as consistent with a gradual easing in labor demand participants generally noted however that there were no signs of rapid deterioration in labor market conditions as layoffs remained low participants generally judged that current labor market conditions were broadly consistent with the committees longerrun goal of maximum employment with regard to the outlook for the labor market participants anticipated that under appropriate monetary policy conditions in the labor market would likely remain solid participants generally noted that labor market indicators merited close monitoring several participants observed that the evaluation of underlying trends in labor market developments had continued to be challenging and that assessments of the outlook for the labor market were associated with considerable uncertainty some participants noted that the labor market could soften further as the recent pace of payroll growth had been below the rate that would likely keep the unemployment rate constant given a stable labor force participation rate participants observed that economic activity had continued to expand at a solid pace and that recent data on economic activity and consumer spending in particular were on balance stronger than anticipated participants remarked that consumption had been supported by a solid labor market rising real wages and elevated household net worth several participants cautioned that low and moderateincome households continued to experience financial strains which could damp their minutes of the federal open market committee spending a couple of participants cited continued increases in rates of delinquencies on credit card borrowing and automobile loans as signs of such strains with regard to the business sector several participants noted that favorable aggregate supply developmentsincluding increases in labor supply business investment and productivitycontinued to support a solid expansion of business activity a majority of participants remarked that the behavior of equity markets reflected positive sentiment on the part of investors many participants also remarked that district contacts generally reported greater optimism about the economic outlook stemming in part from an expectation of an easing in government regulations and changes in tax policies in contrast some participants noted that contacts reported increased uncertainty regarding potential changes in federal government policies a couple of participants remarked that the agricultural sector continued to face significant strains stemming from low crop prices and high input costs in their evaluation of the risks and uncertainties associated with the economic outlook the vast majority of participants judged the risks to the attainment of the committees dualmandate objectives of maximum employment and price stability to be roughly in balance in particular participants saw twosided risks to achieving those goals almost all participants judged that upside risks to the inflation outlook had increased as reasons for this judgment participants cited recent strongerthan expected readings on inflation and the likely effects of potential changes in trade and immigration policy other reasons mentioned included possible disruptions in global supply chains due to geopolitical developments a largerthananticipated easing in financial conditions strongerthan expected household spending and more persistent shelter price increases a few participants remarked that in the period ahead it might be difficult to distinguish more persistent influences on inflation from potentially temporary ones such as those stemming from changes in trade policy that could lead to shifts in the level of prices most participants noted that risks to the achievement of the committees maximumemployment goal appeared to be roughly balanced though some saw risks to the labor market as tilted to the downside participants pointed to various risks to economic activity and employment including downside risks associated with weaker output growth abroad increased financial vulnerabilities stemming from overvaluation of risky assets or an unexpected weakening of the labor market and upside risks associated with increased optimism and continued strength in domestic spending as upside factors in their consideration of monetary policy at this meeting participants generally noted that inflation had made progress toward the committees objective but remained somewhat elevated participants also observed that recent indicators suggested that economic activity had continued to expand at a solid pace labor market conditions had generally eased since earlier in the year and the unemployment rate had moved up but remained low the vast majority of participants viewed it as appropriate to december lower the target range for the federal funds rate by basis points to to percent they assessed that such a further lowering of the target range for the policy rate would help maintain the strength in the economy and the labor market while continuing to enable further progress on inflation a majority of participants noted that their judgments about this meetings appropriate policy action had been finely balanced some participants stated that there was merit in keeping the target range for the federal funds rate unchanged these participants suggested that the risk of persistently elevated inflation had increased in recent months and several of these participants stressed the need for monetary policy to help foster financial conditions that would be consistent with inflation returning sustainably to percent participants judged that it was appropriate to continue the process of reducing the federal reserves securities holdings in discussing the outlook for monetary policy participants indicated that the committee was at or near the point at which it would be appropriate to slow the pace of policy easing they also indicated that if the data came in about as expected with inflation continuing to move down sustainably to percent and the economy remaining near maximum employment it would be appropriate to continue to move gradually toward a more neutral stance of policy over time some participants observed that with the target range for the federal funds rate having been lowered a total of basis points with this meetings decision the policy rate was now significantly closer to its neutral value than when the committee commenced policy easing in september in addition many participants suggested that a variety of factors underlined the need for a careful approach to monetary policy decisions over coming quarters these factors included recent elevated inflation readings the continuing strength of spending reduced downside risks to the outlook for the labor market and economic activity and increased upside risks to the outlook for inflation a substantial majority of participants observed that at the current juncture with its policy stance still meaningfully restrictive the committee was well positioned to take time to assess the evolving outlook for economic activity and inflation including the economys responses to the committees earlier policy actions participants noted that monetary policy decisions were not on a preset course and were conditional on the evolution of the economy the economic outlook and the balance of risks in discussing riskmanagement considerations that could bear on the outlook for monetary policy the vast majority of participants agreed that risks to achieving the committees employment and inflation goals remained roughly in balance many participants observed that the current high degree of uncertainty made it appropriate for the committee to take a gradual approach as it moved toward a neutral policy stance participants noted that although inflation was on course to return sustainably to percent over the next few years and the committee was determined to restore and maintain price stability the likelihood that elevated inflation could be more persistent had increased most participants remarked that with the stance of monetary policy now significantly less restrictive the committee could take a careful approach in considering adjustments to the stance of monetary policy minutes of the federal open market committee many participants noted that the committee could hold the policy rate at a restrictive level or ease policy more slowly if inflation remained elevated and several remarked that policy easing could take place more rapidly if labor market conditions deteriorated economic activity faltered or inflation returned to percent more quickly than anticipated committee policy actions in their discussions of monetary policy for this meeting members agreed that recent indicators suggested that economic activity had continued to expand at a solid pace labor market conditions had generally eased since earlier in the year and the unemployment rate had moved up but remained low members concurred that inflation had made progress toward the committees percent objective but remained somewhat elevated almost all members agreed that the risks to achieving the committees employment and inflation goals were roughly in balance members viewed the economic outlook as uncertain and agreed that they were attentive to the risks to both sides of the committees dual mandate in support of its goals the committee agreed to lower the target range for the federal funds rate by basis points to to percent one member voted against that decision preferring to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at to percent in light of their judgment that after this meeting the committee would likely slow the pace of further adjustments to the stance of monetary policy members agreed to indicate that in considering the extent and timing of additional adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate the committee would carefully assess incoming data the evolving outlook and the balance of risks members agreed to continue to reduce the federal reserves holdings of treasury securities and agency debt and agency mortgagebacked securities members also judged that it was appropriate to make a technical adjustment to the rate offered at the on rrp facility by setting it equal to the bottom of the target range for the federal funds rate thereby bringing the rate back into an alignment that had existed when the facility was established as a monetary policy tool all members agreed that the postmeeting statement should affirm their strong commitment both to supporting maximum employment and to returning inflation to the committees percent objective members agreed that in assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy the committee would continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook they would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerged that could impede the attainment of the committees goals members also agreed that their assessments would take into account a wide range of information including readings on labor market conditions inflation pressures and inflation expectations and financial and international developments december at the conclusion of the discussion the committee voted to direct the federal reserve bank of new york until instructed otherwise to execute transactions in the system open market account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive for release at pm effective december the federal open market committee directs the desk to undertake open market operations as necessary to maintain the federal funds rate in a target range of to percent conduct standing overnight repurchase agreement operations with a minimum bid rate of percent and with an aggregate operation limit of billion conduct standing overnight reverse repurchase agreement operations at an offering rate of percent and with a percounterparty limit of billion per day setting this rate at the bottom of the target range for the federal funds rate is intended to support effective monetary policy implementation and the smooth functioning of shortterm funding markets roll over at auction the amount of principal payments from the federal reserves holdings of treasury securities maturing in each calendar month that exceeds a cap of billion per month redeem treasury coupon securities up to this monthly cap and treasury bills to the extent that coupon principal payments are less than the monthly cap reinvest the amount of principal payments from the federal reserves holdings of agency debt and agency mortgagebacked securities mbs received in each calendar month that exceeds a cap of billion per month into treasury securities to roughly match the maturity composition of treasury securities outstanding allow modest deviations from stated amounts for reinvestments if needed for operational reasons engage in dollar roll and coupon swap transactions as necessary to facilitate settlement of the federal reserves agency mbs transactions the vote also encompassed approval of the statement below for release at pm recent indicators suggest that economic activity has continued to expand at a solid pace since earlier in the year labor market conditions have generally eased and the unemployment rate has moved up but remains low inflation has made progress toward the committees percent objective but remains somewhat elevated the committee seeks to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of percent over the longer run the committee judges that the risks to achieving its employment and minutes of the federal open market committee inflation goals are roughly in balance the economic outlook is uncertain and the committee is attentive to the risks to both sides of its dual mandate in support of its goals the committee decided to lower the target range for the federal funds rate by percentage point to to percent in considering the extent and timing of additional adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate the committee will carefully assess incoming data the evolving outlook

christopher j waller voting against this action beth m hammack president hammack dissented because she preferred to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at to percent in light of uneven progress in returning inflation to percent the strength of the economy and the labor market and the state of financial conditions in her view with the current federal funds rate not far from neutral holding the funds rate at a modestly restrictive stance for a time was appropriate to ensure that inflation returns to percent in a timely fashion consistent with the committees decision to lower the target range for the federal funds rate to to percent the board of governors of the federal reserve system voted unanimously to lower the interest rate paid on reserve balances to percent

regularly scheduled meeting of the committee in jerome h powell chair john c williams vice chair joshua gallin secretary matthew m luecke deputy secretary brian j bonis assistant secretary michelle a

vote the committee selected the federal reserve bank of new york to execute transactions for the system open market account soma by unanimous vote the committee selected roberto perli and julie ann remache to serve at the pleasure of the committee as manager and deputy manager of the soma respectively on the understanding that these selections were subject to being satisfactory to the federal reserve bank of new york secretarys note the federal reserve bank of new york subsequently sent advice that the selections indicated previously were satisfactory minutes of the federal open market committee by unanimous vote the committee voted to reaffirm without revision the fomc authorizations and continuing directives for open market operations all participants indicated support for and agreed to abide by the fomc policy on investment and trading for committee participants and federal reserve system staff the program for security of fomc information the fomc policy on external communications of committee participants and the fomc policy on external communications of federal reserve system staff the committee voted unanimously to approve those four policies review of monetary policy strategy tools and communications committee participants began discussions related to their review of the federal reserves monetary policy framework this review is focused on two specific areas the committees statement on longerrun goals and monetary policy strategy which presents the committees approach to the conduct of monetary policy and the committees policy communication practices the committees percent longerrun inflation goal will be retained and is not a focus of the review in support of these discussions staff briefings provided a retrospective on the committees framework review and summarized the experience abroad in conducting reviews of monetary policy frameworks the staff presentation began by recapping the creation and evolution of the committees statement on longerrun goals and monetary policy strategy and the context of the committees review the adoption of the statement in introduced the committees percent inflation target and codified longstanding practices followed by the committee and as such was an important step in improving the transparency accountability and predictability of us monetary policymaking the launch of the review was motivated in part by a desire to evaluate the experience of the global financial crisis and its aftermath during this period inflation had run persistently below the committees percent objective even as the unemployment rate and interest rates remained low these developments indicated a greater risk that the federal funds rate would be constrained by its effective lower bound elb more often in the future posing challenges to the achievement of the committees dualmandate goals over the medium term the staff summarized the scope and components of the review including its outreach to a broad range of individuals and groups and the rationale behind the changes made to the statement at the end of the review in summarizing the international experience the staff noted that occasional reviews of monetary policy frameworks were seen as useful in adapting to evolving economic environments promoting transparency and fostering public understanding and therefore were becoming the norm in advanced economies reviews abroad had covered various aspects related to monetary policy goals january strategies tools communications forecasting and governance with some of the recent reviews giving particular attention to topics such as the experience of the covid pandemic the ensuing global inflation episode and the conduct and communication of monetary policy in times of unusual uncertainty participants viewed the statement as having played an important role in building a common understanding among policymakers of the congressionally mandated monetary policy goals and of their monetary policy strategy the statement and other means of policy communication also figured importantly in conveying that understanding to the public and helping to anchor inflation expectations thereby supporting the effective transmission of monetary policy participants indicated that they were looking forward to their discussions at upcoming meetings and to hearing a range of perspectives at various fed listens events as well as at a planned research conference and that they were approaching the review with open minds participants noted that the economic consequences of the covid pandemic were largely unforeseen at the time of the review and that the current economic environment differed greatly from the period leading up to that review which was characterized in part by persistently low inflation and interest rates in light of the experience of the past five years participants assessed that it was important to consider potential revisions to the statement with particular attention to some of the elements introduced in participants highlighted as areas of consideration the statements focus on the risks to the economy posed by the elb the approach of mitigating shortfalls from maximum employment and the approach of aiming to achieve inflation moderately above percent following periods of persistently belowtarget inflation participants emphasized the need for the fomcs monetary policy framework to be robust to a wide range of economic circumstances they noted that economic uncertaintyincluding about the values of the longerrun neutral policy rate the economys potential growth rate and the level of maximum employmentwould remain an important factor affecting their decisionmaking participants also mentioned aspects of the statement that they thought should continue to be emphasizedincluding the committees firm commitment to achieving maximum employment and percent inflation as well as the importance of keeping longerterm inflation expectations well anchored participants expected that their discussions related to the framework review would continue at upcoming meetings they expected the review to wrap up by late summer and intended to report the outcomes of the review to the public developments in financial markets and open market operations the manager turned first to a review of developments in financial markets over the intermeeting period broad equity price indexes had declined moderately credit spreads had remained very tight minutes of the federal open market committee and the tradeweighted value of the dollar had risen slightly in considering the expected path of the federal funds rate the manager noted that the modal policy rate path implied by options prices had not changed appreciably on net over the intermeeting period and was broadly consistent with a single quarterpoint lowering of the target range for the federal funds rate taking place during the average rate path implied by futures prices was also little changed and was above the corresponding median rates in the december summary of economic projections the modal path implied by the open market desks survey of market expectations shifted up somewhat over the intermeeting period with respondents generally judging that policy rate reductions would occur later than previously assessed and was broadly consistent with marketimplied paths at horizons up to early beyond that period however the surveybased path was notably below the marketimplied path this discrepancy likely partly reflected positive market risk premiums as well as survey biases in their expectations of federal reserve balance sheet policy survey respondents on average saw the process of runoff concluding by mid slightly later than they had previously expected the manager next considered the recent behavior of treasury yields longerterm nominal treasury yields had risen sharply following the committees december meeting and the release of the unexpectedly strong december payrolls report subsequently a partial retracing of this increase took place after consumer price index cpi data indicated that prices rose more slowly than expected in december over the intermeeting period longerdated treasury yields rose to basis points while shorterdated yields were little changed the manager discussed staff analysis that had aimed at decomposing the increase of nearly basis points in longerterm treasury yields that had taken place since midseptember that analysis suggested an upward revision in financial markets evaluation of the path of the real policy rate required to achieve the committees goals especially at longer horizons nevertheless much of the increase in real yields was in real term premiums likely reflecting uncertainty about the policy rate trajectory as well as a number of other factors the manager noted that measures of inflation compensation had generally risen slightly however both survey measures of inflation expectations and pricing in the treasury inflationprotected securities market remained broadly consistent with the anticipation that inflation would return to the committees percent inflation objective with respect to money markets the manager noted that decembers quarterpoint lowering of the target range for the federal funds rate had been fully passed through to other shortterm interest rates in addition the basis point technical adjustment to the overnight reverse repurchase agreement on rrp offering rate implemented in december appeared to have been transmitted nearly in full to repurchase agreement repo rates money market conditions had been orderly over yearend with the technical adjustment to the on rrp offering rate directly contributing to a lower rate environment by keeping repo rates below the values that would have otherwise prevailed january throughout the week of yearend the desk conducted standing repo facility srf auctions each morning in addition to the regular afternoon auctions although there was no takeup market contacts suggested that the morning auctions may also have helped contain yearend pressures the manager noted that morning srf auctions may be conducted again in the future on december a considerable volume of activity had taken place in the noncentrally cleared segment of the repo market in which the srf operates at rates above the srf rate the manager stated that in the future the desk may consider possible ways to improve the efficacy of the facility in that market segment the manager observed that usage of the on rrp facility increased as expected at yearend but had declined on net over the intermeeting period the manager also noted that a range of indicators continued to suggest that reserves had remained abundant over the intermeeting period however the manager cautioned that the debt limit situation may cloud the signals provided by the indicators in addition reserves might decline quickly upon resolution of the debt limit and at the current pace of balance sheet runoff might potentially reach levels below those viewed by the committee as appropriate next the deputy manager briefed policymakers on possible alternative strategies that the committee might follow with regard to purchases of treasury securities in the secondary market after the eventual conclusion of the process of balance sheet runoff these strategies would further implement the policy laid out in the committees principles and plans for reducing the size of the federal reserves balance sheet the briefing outlined a few illustrative scenarios under each scenario principal payments received from agency debt and agency mortgagebacked securities mbs holdings would be directed toward treasury securities via secondarymarket purchases the scenarios presented corresponded to different trajectories of the holdings of treasury securities in the soma under all scenarios considered the maturity composition of treasury holdings in the soma portfolio moved into closer alignment with the maturity composition of the outstanding stock of treasury securities the scenarios differed on how quickly this alignment would be achieved and correspondingly on the assumed increase over coming years in the share of treasury bills held in the soma portfolio by unanimous vote the committee ratified the desks domestic transactions over the intermeeting period there were no intervention operations in foreign currencies for the systems account during the intermeeting period staff review of the economic situation the information available at the time of the meeting indicated that real gross domestic product gdp rose at a solid pace in after a period of considerable rebalancing labor market conditions had minutes of the federal open market committee stabilized and the unemployment rate remained low consumer price inflation remained somewhat elevated total consumer price inflationas measured by the month change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures pcewas percent in november down from its yearearlier pace of percent core pce price inflation which excludes changes in consumer energy prices and many consumer food prices was percent in november down from percent a year ago in december the month change in the cpi was percent and core cpi inflation was percent both were below their yearearlier rates based on the cpi and the producer price index the staff estimated that total pce price inflation would be reported as percent over the months ending in december and that core pce price inflation would be percent recent data suggested that labor market conditions remained solid and that the labor market was not especially tight average monthly gains for nonfarm payrolls over the fourth quarter were slightly higher than their thirdquarter pace the unemployment rate edged down to percent in december while the labor force participation rate was unchanged and the employmenttopopulation ratio moved up slightly the unemployment rates for african americans and for hispanics moved down but remained higher than the rates for asians and for whites the ratio of job vacancies to unemployed workers edged up to in december its average over and the quits rate fell back to percent and remained well below its average average hourly earnings for all employees rose percent over the months ending in december down from percent a year ago available data indicated that real gdp rose at a solid pace in the fourth quarter real private domestic final purchases which comprises pce and private fixed investment and which often provides a better signal than gdp of underlying economic momentum appeared to have risen faster than real gdp in the fourth quarter led by continued strength in consumer spending by contrast monthly trade data were volatile but overall pointed to a stepdown in both export and import growth relative to the third quarter the pace of foreign economic activity appeared to have moderated at the end of last year indicators suggested that in both the euro area and mexico economic growth had slowed notably in the fourth quarter amid lackluster manufacturing activity and subdued private consumption by contrast chinese growth had picked up in large part because of policy stimulus and elsewhere in emerging asia the pace of activity looked to have remained solid supported by strong global demand for high tech manufacturing goods inflation abroad continued to ease in most advanced foreign economies afes headline inflation hovered near target levels mainly reflecting the rapid passthrough of lower energy prices in the second half of even so services price inflation remained elevated in some of these economies january such as germany in china inflation remained close to zero partly reflecting lower food prices by contrast in some latin american countries most notably brazil inflation continued to increase in part spurred by currency depreciation many foreign central banks eased policy during the intermeeting period including the bank of canada the european central bank and the swiss national bank among the afes and the central banks of colombia indonesia and mexico among the emerging market economies emes in contrast amid improving economic conditions the bank of japan increased its policy rate taking a further step in gradually removing policy accommodation staff review of the financial situation the marketimplied path of the federal funds rate over the next year was little changed on net over the intermeeting period yields on shorterterm nominal treasury securities edged down but longerterm rates rose moderately the increase in longerterm yields appeared to be partly attributable to higher term premiums measures of inflation compensation over the near term moved up but measures of longerterm inflation compensation remained at levels consistent with inflation returning over time to the committees percent objective broad equity price indexes were little changed on net while measures of the equity risk premium remained low and corporate bond spreads remained compressed by historical standards the vixa forwardlooking measure of nearterm equity market volatilitywas also roughly unchanged on net and remained at a moderate level by historical standards foreign financial market moves over the intermeeting period mainly reflected developments in the us including trade policy news and the relative strength of the us economic data releases during the period the broad dollar index increased slightly on net longerterm afe yields edged higher reflecting in part spillovers from higher us yields stock price indexes increased in most foreign countries with the notable exception of china in which equity prices declined moderately in part reflecting weakerthanexpected forwardlooking manufacturing indicators capital outflows from emerging markets continued and several eme central banks drew down their foreign exchange reserves including their holdings of us treasury securities to resist currency depreciation pressures conditions in us shortterm funding markets remained generally stable over the intermeeting period with the lowering of the target range for the federal funds rate in december fully passing through to both secured and unsecured reference rates rates in secured markets exhibited temporary and typical upward pressure around yearend excluding the yearend period rates in secured markets declined somewhat relative to the effective federal funds rate likely reflecting the effects of the nearly full passthrough of decembers technical adjustment to the on rrp offering rate and of declining bill minutes of the federal open market committee issuance on rrp usage increased around yearend but declined slightly on net over the intermeeting period in domestic credit markets borrowing costs for households and most businesses remained elevated rates on year fixedrate conforming residential mortgages rose interest rates for credit cards and new auto loans declined but remained elevated relative to their historical ranges meanwhile interest rates on commercial and industrial ci loans and small business loans remained elevated yields rose for an array of fixedincome securities including investmentgrade corporate bonds and senior commercial mbs tranches consistent with movements in longterm treasury yields financing through capital markets and nonbank lenders remained broadly available for public corporations and for large and midsize private corporations with respect to smaller firms however credit availability remained relatively tight issuance of corporate bonds and leveraged loans moderated toward yearend likely reflecting seasonal factors regarding bank credit banks in the january senior loan officer opinion survey on bank lending practices sloos reported leaving their ci loan standards basically unchanged on net over the fourth quarter meanwhile growth in ci loan balances picked up from modest levels banks in the january sloos reported tighter lending standards for all commercial real estate cre loan categories consistent with tight standards growth in cre loans on banks books remained subdued in the fourth quarter credit remained available for most households though standards appear to have tightened somewhat for lowercreditscore borrowers growth in credit card loan balances at banks picked up in the fourth quarter but issuance of new credit cards to nonprime borrowers continued to decline in the residential mortgage market credit remained easily available for highcreditscore borrowers but tightened slightly in november and december for lowerscore borrowers in the january sloos respondents on net indicated that standards tightened for credit cards eased for auto loans and were about unchanged for most residential mortgages credit quality remained solid for large and midsize firms most home mortgage borrowers and municipalities but continued to deteriorate in other sectors the credit performance of corporate bonds and leveraged loans showed some signs of deterioration but remained generally stable delinquency rates on loans to small businesses ticked down but remained elevated credit quality in the cre market deteriorated further driven largely by office and multifamily loans regarding household credit quality the delinquency rate on federal housing administration mortgages edged up in november and remained elevated relative to the past few years in contrast delinquency rates on the sloos results reported are based on banks responses weighted by each banks outstanding loans in the respective loan category and might therefore differ from the results reported in the published sloos which are based on banks unweighted responses january most other mortgage loan types remained low delinquency rates for credit cards increased a bit further in the third quarter while those for auto loans stayed about flat the staff provided an update on its assessment of the stability of the us financial system and on balance continued to characterize the systems financial vulnerabilities as notable the staff judged that asset valuation pressures were elevated in contrast to valuations in equity corporate debt and residential real estate markets cre property prices have declined notably in recent years though price indexes were about flat in the third quarter vulnerabilities associated with business and household debt were characterized as moderate nonfinancial business leverage was elevated by historical standards but the ability of publicly traded firms to service their debt remained strong supported by robust earnings and the low interest rates that firms continued to enjoy on the portion of fixedrate debt issued early in the pandemic that said the fraction of private firm debt having very low interest coverage ratios continued to increase pointing to further deterioration in the balance sheets of riskier firms household balance sheets remained solid overall as aggregate home equity remained high and delinquencies on mortgage loans continued to be low vulnerabilities associated with leverage in the financial sector were characterized as notable regulatory capital ratios in the banking sector remained high however banks continued to hold large quantities of longduration assets leaving them more exposed than usual to an unexpected rise in longerterm interest rates in the nonbank sector leverage at hedge funds remained high vulnerabilities associated with funding risks were characterized as moderate large nonglobal systemically important banks and regional banks reduced their reliance on uninsured deposits notably since the end of though assets in prime money market funds had been growing recently their size relative to gdp remained well below levels seen before staff economic outlook the staff projection for economic activity was similar to the one prepared for the december meeting with the output gap expected to narrow further until early next year and to remain roughly flat thereafter and with the unemployment rate expected to remain close to the staffs estimate of its natural rate for this projection the staff had used the same preliminary placeholder assumptions for potential policy changes that were used for the previous baseline forecast and continued to note elevated uncertainty regarding the scope timing and potential economic effects of possible changes to trade immigration fiscal and regulatory policies the staff highlighted the difficulty of assessing the importance of such factors for the baseline projection and had prepared a number of alternative scenarios minutes of the federal open market committee the staffs inflation projection was also essentially unchanged from the one prepared for the previous meeting inflation in was expected to be similar to s rate as the effects of the staffs placeholder assumption for trade policy put upward pressure on inflation this year after that inflation was projected to decline to percent by the staff continued to view the uncertainty around the baseline projection as similar to the average over the past years a period that saw a number of episodes during which uncertainty about the economy and federal policy changes was elevated the staff judged that the risks around the baseline projections for economic activity and employment were roughly balanced the risks around the baseline projection for inflation were seen as skewed to the upside because core inflation had not come down as much as expected in and because changes to trade policy could put more upward pressure on inflation than the staff had assumed participants views on current conditions and the economic outlook in their discussion of inflation developments participants observed that inflation had eased significantly over the past two years inflation remained somewhat elevated however relative to the committees percent longerrun goal and progress toward that goal had slowed over the past year available data suggested that total pce prices had risen about percent over the months ending in december and that excluding the volatile consumer food and energy categories core pce prices rose percent a number of participants remarked that current readings of month inflation were boosted by relatively high inflation readings in the first quarter of last year and several participants noted that cumulative inflation over the past or months showed greater progress than month measures most participants commented that monthovermonth inflation readings in november and december had exhibited notable progress toward the committees goal of price stability including in some key subcategories many participants however emphasized that additional evidence of continued disinflation would be needed to support the view that inflation was returning sustainably to percent regarding the subcategories housing services inflation which had remained elevated for much of the previous year had shown a decline as had marketbased measures of core nonhousing services inflation several participants noted that some nonmarket based services price categories such as financial and insurance services had shown less improvement but a few also observed that price movements in such categories typically have not provided reliable signals about resource pressures or the future trajectory of inflation several participants observed that core goods prices had not declined as much on net in recent months compared with earlier in with regard to the outlook for inflation participants expected that under appropriate monetary policy inflation would continue to move toward percent although progress could remain uneven january participants cited various factors as likely to put continuing downward pressure on inflation including an easing in nominal wage growth wellanchored longerterm inflation expectations waning business pricing power and the committees stillrestrictive monetary policy stance a few noted however that the current target range for the federal funds rate may not be far above its neutral level furthermore some participants commented that with supply and demand in the labor market roughly in balance and in light of recent productivity gains labor market conditions were unlikely to be a source of inflationary pressure in the near future however other factors were cited as having the potential to hinder the disinflation process including the effects of potential changes in trade and immigration policy as well as strong consumer demand business contacts in a number of districts had indicated that firms would attempt to pass on to consumers higher input costs arising from potential tariffs in addition some participants noted that some market or surveybased measures of expected inflation had increased recently although many participants emphasized that longerterm measures of expected inflation had remained well anchored some participants remarked that reported inflation at the beginning of the year was harder than usual to interpret because of the difficulties in fully removing seasonal effects and a couple of participants commented that any increase in reported inflation in the first quarter due to such difficulties would imply a corresponding decrease in reported inflation in other quarters of the year participants judged that labor market conditions had remained solid and that those conditions were broadly consistent with the committees goal of maximum employment payroll gains had averaged per month over the last three months of and the unemployment rate had stabilized at a relatively low level participants also noted that recent readings of indicators such as job vacancies the quits rate and labor turnover were generally consistent with stable labor market conditions participants anticipated that under appropriate monetary policy conditions in the labor market would likely remain solid nonetheless participants generally noted that labor market indicators merited close monitoring business contacts in a few districts noted that they were expecting stable employment levels and moderate wage growth at their firms a couple of participants noted that the upcoming benchmark revision to the payroll growth estimates by the bureau of labor statistics could provide more clarity regarding labor market conditions participants observed that the economy had continued to expand at a solid pace and that recent data on economic activity and consumer spending in particular were on balance stronger than anticipated participants remarked that consumption had been supported by a solid labor market elevated household net worth and rising real wages which had been associated in part with productivity gains several participants cautioned that low and moderateincome households continued to experience financial strains which could damp their spending a few participants cited minutes of the federal open market committee continued increases in rates of delinquencies on credit card borrowing and automobile loans as signs of such strains with regard to the business sector participants observed that investment in equipment and intangibles was strong over the past year though it appeared to have slowed in the fourth quarter some participants noted that favorable aggregate supply developmentsincluding increases in labor supply business investment and productivitycontinued to support a solid expansion of business activity many participants remarked that district contacts or surveys of businesses reported substantial optimism about the economic outlook stemming in part from an expectation of an easing in government regulations or changes in tax policies in contrast some participants noted that contacts reported increased uncertainty regarding potential changes in federal government policies a couple of participants remarked that the agricultural sector continued to face significant strains stemming from low crop prices and high input costs a number of participants commented on the financial conditions bearing on spending by households and businesses participants generally saw it as important to continue to keep a close watch on such conditions and their potential effects on economic activity and inflation many participants noted that certain financial conditions had tightened over the past several months for example longerterm treasury and corporate bond yields and mortgage rates had risen notably a couple of participants commented that high equity valuations or low credit spreads were providing some support to economic activity in their evaluation of the risks and uncertainties associated with the economic outlook the vast majority of participants judged that the risks to the achievement of the committees dualmandate objectives of maximum employment and price stability were roughly in balance though a couple commented that the risks to achieving the price stability mandate currently appeared to be greater than the risks to achieving the maximum employment mandate participants generally pointed to upside risks to the inflation outlook in particular participants cited the possible effects of potential changes in trade and immigration policy the potential for geopolitical developments to disrupt supply chains or strongerthanexpected household spending a couple of participants remarked that in the period ahead it might be especially difficult to distinguish between relatively persistent changes in inflation and more temporary changes that might be associated with the introduction of new government policies participants pointed to various risks to economic activity and employment including downside risks associated with an unexpected weakening of the labor market a weakening of consumers financial positions or a tightening of financial conditions as well as upside risks associated with a potentially more favorable regulatory environment for businesses and continued strength in domestic spending january in their discussion of financial stability participants who commented noted a range of factors that warranted monitoring several participants mentioned issues related to the banking system a few commented that bank funding risks had lessened and that many banks had improved their ability to access the discount window however a couple observed that some banks had increased their reliance on reciprocal deposits and that the stability of these deposits had not been tested in a time of stress several participants noted that some banks remained vulnerable to a rise in longerterm yields and the associated unrealized losses on bank assets several participants also mentioned potential vulnerabilities at nonbank financial institutions or nonfinancial corporations to a rise in longerterm yields or to leverage in these sectors a few participants noted concerns about asset valuation pressures in equity and corporate debt markets a few participants discussed vulnerabilities associated with cre exposures noting that risks remained although there were some signs that the deterioration of conditions in the cre sector was lessening several participants commented on cyber risks that could impair the operation of financial institutions financial infrastructure and potentially the overall economy several participants commented on vulnerabilities in the treasury market including concerns about dealer intermediation capacity and the degree of leveraged positions in the market the migration to central clearing was noted by a few as an important development to track in this regard in their consideration of monetary policy at this meeting participants noted that inflation remained somewhat elevated participants also observed that recent indicators suggested that economic activity had continued to expand at a solid pace that the unemployment rate had stabilized at a low level and that labor market conditions had remained solid in recent months with the stance of policy significantly less restrictive than it had been before the committees policy easing over its previous three meetings all participants viewed it as appropriate to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at to percent participants judged that it was appropriate to continue the process of reducing the federal reserves securities holdings in discussing the outlook for monetary policy participants observed that the committee was well positioned to take time to assess the evolving outlook for economic activity the labor market and inflation with the vast majority pointing to a stillrestrictive policy stance participants indicated that provided the economy remained near maximum employment they would want to see further progress on inflation before making additional adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate participants noted that policy decisions were not on a preset course and were conditional on the evolution of the economy the economic outlook and the balance of risks in discussing riskmanagement considerations that could bear on the outlook for monetary policy a majority of participants observed that the current high degree of uncertainty made it appropriate for the committee to take a careful approach in considering additional adjustments to the stance of minutes of the federal open market committee monetary policy factors mentioned by participants as supporting such an approach included the reduced downside risks to the outlook for the labor market and economic activity increased upside risks to the outlook for inflation and uncertainties concerning the neutral rate of interest the degree of restraint from higher longerterm interest rates or the economic effects of potential government policies many participants noted that the committee could hold the policy rate at a restrictive level if the economy remained strong and inflation remained elevated while several remarked that policy could be eased if labor market conditions deteriorated economic activity faltered or inflation returned to percent more quickly than anticipated a number of participants also discussed some issues related to the balance sheet regarding the composition of secondarymarket purchases of treasury securities that would occur once the process of reducing the size of the federal reserves holdings of securities had come to an end many participants expressed the view that it would be appropriate to structure purchases in a way that moved the maturity composition of the soma portfolio closer to that of the outstanding stock of treasury debt while also minimizing the risk of disruptions to the market regarding the potential for significant swings in reserves over coming months related to debt ceiling dynamics various participants noted that it may be appropriate to consider pausing or slowing balance sheet runoff until the resolution of this event several participants also expressed support for the desks future consideration of possible ways to improve the efficacy of the srf committee policy actions in their discussions of monetary policy for this meeting members agreed that recent indicators suggested that economic activity had continued to expand at a solid pace the unemployment rate had stabilized at a low level in recent months and labor market conditions had remained solid members concurred that inflation remained somewhat elevated almost all members agreed that the risks to achieving the committees employment and inflation goals were roughly in balance members viewed the economic outlook as uncertain and agreed that they were attentive to the risks to both sides of the committees dual mandate in support of its goals the committee agreed to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at to percent members agreed that in considering the extent and timing of additional adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate the committee would carefully assess incoming data the evolving outlook and the balance of risks members agreed to continue to reduce the federal reserves holdings of treasury securities and agency debt and agency mbs all members agreed that the postmeeting statement should affirm their strong commitment both to supporting maximum employment and to returning inflation to the committees percent objective january members agreed that in assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy the committee would continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook they would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerged that could impede the attainment of the committees goals members also agreed that their assessments would take into account a wide range of information including readings on labor market conditions inflation pressures and inflation expectations and financial and international developments at the conclusion of the discussion the committee voted to direct the federal reserve bank of new york until instructed otherwise to execute transactions in the soma in accordance with the following domestic policy directive for release at pm effective january the federal open market committee directs the desk to undertake open market operations as necessary to maintain the federal funds rate in a target range of to percent conduct standing overnight repurchase agreement operations with a minimum bid rate of percent and with an aggregate operation limit of billion conduct

the federal reserves holdings of treasury securities maturing in each calendar month that exceeds a cap of billion per month redeem treasury coupon securities up to this monthly cap and treasury bills to the extent that coupon principal payments are less than the monthly cap reinvest the amount of principal payments from the federal reserves holdings of agency debt and agency mortgagebacked securities mbs received in each calendar month that exceeds a cap of billion per month into treasury securities to roughly match the maturity composition of treasury securities outstanding allow modest deviations from stated amounts for reinvestments if needed for operational reasons engage in dollar roll and coupon swap transactions as necessary to facilitate settlement of the federal reserves agency mbs transactions the vote also encompassed approval of the statement below for release at pm minutes of the federal open market committee recent indicators suggest that economic activity has continued to expand at a solid pace the unemployment rate has stabilized at a low level in recent months and labor market conditions remain solid inflation remains somewhat elevated the committee seeks to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of percent over the longer run the committee judges that the risks to achieving its employment and inflation goals are roughly

2025,fomcminutes20250319.pdf,fomc federal reserv e system minutes of the federal open market committee march minutes of the federal open market committee march a joint meeting of the federal open market committee and the board of governors of the federal reserve system was held in the offices of the board of governors on tuesday march at am and continued on wednesday march at am review of monetary policy strategy tools and communications committee participants continued their discussions related to their review of the federal reserves monetary policy framework with a focus on labor market dynamics and the fomcs maximum employment goal the staff briefed policymakers on the concept of maximum employment and related labor market indicators they discussed conceptual benchmarks used in evaluating the position of the labor market relative to maximum employment and in ascertaining the interaction of maximum employment and price stability they discussed a set of core labor market indicators used to help assess maximum employment including the unemployment rate job vacancies the employmenttopopulation epop ratio and the labor force participation rate lfpr and described the use of these indicators in assessing maximum employment during the pandemicrelated recession and subsequent economic recovery the staff also presented modelbased analysis of simple monetary policy rules that respond to deviations of inflation from percent but differ on whether they respond to shortfalls or deviations from maximum employment participants generally supported the current description of maximum employment in the statement on longerrun goals and monetary policy strategy as being not directly measurable and changing over time for reasons owing largely to nonmonetary factors participants acknowledged that it is difficult to assess maximum employment and that they have been well served by monitoring a wide range of indicators that can vary depending on labor market and economic conditions they also reflected on how both the committee and the public have interpreted the current description of maximum employment as a broadbased and inclusive goal participants reviewed the relationship between the dualmandate goals and noted that those goals are not necessarily in conflict when both unemployment and inflation are low participants also discussed the federal open market committee is referenced as the fomc and the committee in these minutes the board of governors of the federal reserve system is referenced as the board in these minutes march the implications of pursuing a strategy that seeks to mitigate shortfalls of employment from its maximum level as described in the statement and the ways the public has interpreted that approach since it was introduced into the statement participants indicated that they thought it would be appropriate to reconsider the shortfalls language they judged that any strategy conveyed in the statement should be robust to a wide range of economic circumstances they also considered the extent to which the current statement had effectively communicated the committees approach to achieving its longerrun goals including the committees assessment of the appropriate policy responses in a period of a tight labor market developments in financial markets and open market operations the manager turned first to a review of financial market developments over the intermeeting period treasury yields declined equity prices fell credit spreads widened and the dollar depreciated these moves appeared to reflect increased perceived risksrather than a base caseof a significant deterioration of the us outlook as investors responded to both weakerthanexpected consumer spending and sentiment data as well as to developments in trade policy that had raised uncertainty the manager observed that the implied average federal funds rate path from futures had shifted noticeably lower over the intermeeting period for horizons beyond the middle of this year by contrast the implied modal federal funds rate path from options was little changed consistent with the interpretation that the baseline outlook had not changed materially the open market desks survey of market expectations told a similar story as the median respondents modal path for the federal funds rate in was little changed the expected timing of rate cuts in and was brought forward about a quarter but the expected terminal rate was unchanged survey respondents however attached noticeably higher probabilities to both lower gross domestic product gdp growth outcomes and higher inflation outcomes for compared with the january survey consistent with a higher perceived risk of a negative supply shock this year nominal treasury yields declined about basis points on net over the period led by decreases in real yields that reflected lower expected real rates and lower real term premiums nearterm measures of inflation compensation rose amid traderelated developments while at horizons beyond a year forward measures of inflation compensation fell overall both market and surveybased measures suggested that inflation expectations remained well anchored us equity prices decreased notably on net over the intermeeting period with particularly pronounced declines in the technology and cyclical sectors while traderelated news had been the most prominent driver of equity price movements the manager also noted that riskmanagement considerations may have led some levered investors to reduce long equity positions that were generating increasing losses amplifying price movements optionimplied volatility of broad equity minutes of the federal open market committee prices increased over the intermeeting period to a level somewhat above its longrun average and credit spreads widened albeit to levels below historical averages asset price dynamics abroad were opposite to those in the us major foreign equity indexes including those of the euro area and china appreciated notably over the intermeeting period while sovereign yields increased in many jurisdictions the dollar depreciated against most major currencies although currencies perceived as more sensitive to higher us tariff rates such as the canadian dollar and those in emerging asia were relatively little changed overall market participants characterized price action across global equities global rates and foreign exchange fx as consistent with some reallocation away from trades that had been based on expectations for continued us economic outperformance relative to global peers the manager turned next to money market developments unsecured overnight rates remained stable over the intermeeting period while rates in the repurchase agreement repo market varied notably and some indicators suggested that conditions in that market had continued to tighten the pass through to repo rates of the basis point technical adjustment to the overnight reverse repurchase agreement on rrp rate made in december appeared to have dissipated in february even though repo rates had declined in midmarch as a result of a drop in bill issuance associated with the debt limit situation furthermore the sensitivity of repo rates in the clienttodealer segment to changes in transaction volumes had diminished relative to the spike observed at yearend but remained at levels above those that prevailed in late the sensitivity of repo rates to treasury bill issuance had also increased in recent months the manager interpreted these developments more as signs of continued normalization of the repo market than as a concern but he also noted that in the past a tightening of the repo market had been a precursor to tighter reserve conditions the manager observed that the on rrp facility had reached a post low of under billion in midfebruary abstracting from the debt limit situation with the on rrp facility nearly depleted portfolio runoff was likely to translate to lower reserves in the future several indicators of reserve conditions continued to point to reserves remaining abundant but the reliability of the signals provided by those indicators was starting to be impaired by the debt limit situation which was already affecting the federal reserves liabilities the treasury general account tga had declined nearly billion since the debt issuance suspension period was declared in january as a result reserves were about billion higher on rrp balances had also increased somewhat reserves were likely to continue to grow except for periods around tax dates until a resolution of the debt limit situation and then drop quickly as the tga is rebuilt in that scenario reserves could potentially reach levels below those viewed by the committee as appropriate without market indicators being able to provide much advance warning the manager noted that either pausing or sufficiently slowing runoff would provide meaningful insurance against that possibility march more generally the manager also noted that slowing runoff would also be an effective wayconsistent with the committees plansof addressing the risks posed by a continued tightening of repo market conditions and a nearly depleted on rrp facility desk survey results indicated that more than half of the respondents expected the committee to either pause or slow runoff as its next move with a majority of those leaning toward a slowdown many respondents also expected the system open market account soma portfolio to consist in the long run of treasury securities only and to match the maturity composition of treasury debt outstanding by unanimous vote the committee ratified the desks domestic transactions over the intermeeting period there were no intervention operations in foreign currencies for the systems account during the intermeeting period staff review of the economic situation the information available at the time of the meeting indicated that real gdp was expanding at a solid pace the unemployment rate had stabilized at a relatively low level since the middle of last year consumer price inflation remained somewhat elevated total consumer price inflationas measured by the month change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures pcewas estimated by the staff to have been percent in february based on the consumer and producer price indexes core pce price inflation which excludes changes in consumer energy prices and many consumer food prices was estimated to have been percent in february both total and core inflation were little changed relative to their yearearlier levels recent data indicated that labor market conditions remained solid and had stabilized the unemployment rate was percent in february the same as in december the epop ratio and the lfpr edged down on balance over january and february average monthly gains for total nonfarm payrolls over january and february were solid but somewhat lower than their pace in the second half of last year the ratio of job vacancies to unemployed workers was in february a bit below its average over and the quits rate edged up to percent in january but was still well below its average the total employment cost index for privatesector workers rose percent over the months ending in december well below its yearearlier level average hourly earnings for all employees rose percent over the months ending in february little changed from a year ago real gdp growth was estimated to have been percent in the fourth quarter and available data suggested that real gdp was still rising at a solid though somewhat slower pace in the first quarter real pce declined in january but retail sales and sales of light motor vehicles bounced back in february in contrast to most of the data in hand used to estimate real gdp growth many indicators of consumer and business sentiment had turned more downbeat over the past two months export minutes of the federal open market committee growth was modest in january import growth was strong relative to its fourthquarter pace consistent with reports that some us importers were stocking up ahead of prospective tariff increases economic growth abroad slowed to a subdued pace in the fourth quarter in part because of weak manufacturing activity in europe and mexico recent export data from abroad and some other indicators suggested that foreign economic growth recovered modestly at the start of this year other indicators however pointed to weak momentum in manufacturing production especially in canada and mexico in china the authorities announced a target of around percent for gdp growth in supported by new fiscal policy measures inflation abroad continued to remain near central bank targets in most foreign economies in advanced foreign economies afes total inflation ticked up in part because of a shortlived spike in oil prices early in the year but core inflation continued to cool as wage growth slowed in china january and february inflation data suggested continued weak underlying price pressures by contrast in some latin american countries most notably brazil inflation picked up further in part driven by past currency depreciation many foreign central banks eased policy during the intermeeting period including the bank of canada the bank of england and the european central bank in the afes and the bank of korea and the bank of mexico in the emerging market economies by contrast the central bank of brazil increased its policy rate amid continued inflation concerns foreign central banks were increasingly noting that elevated uncertainty about trade policies was clouding their economic outlooks staff review of the financial situation over the intermeeting period the marketimplied path of the federal funds rate over the next few meetings edged higher but moved down at horizons beyond september as ongoing trade policy uncertainty indicators of weakening consumer and business sentiment and some softerthan expected economic data releases prompted investors to become more concerned about higher near term inflation and downside risks to economic growth nearterm inflation compensation rose notably although longerterm inflation compensation appeared to remain well anchored nominal and real treasury yields fell notably across the maturity spectrum broad equity price indexes declined notably on net the vixa forwardlooking measure of nearterm equity market volatilityrose on net following disappointing economic data releases and a number of tariffrelated developments and ended the period somewhat above its median over the past few decades credit spreads on investment and speculativegrade bonds widened on net consistent with emerging concerns about economic growth although both spreads remained narrow by historical standards march foreign financial markets were affected by investor concerns about global economic growth in part related to higher tariffs while expectations for greater fiscal spending in some economies provided an offsetting effect on balance longerterm yields and equity indexes increased in most major foreign economies tariffrelated developments led to significant volatility in fx markets and the exchange value of the dollar declined on net as investor optimism regarding the relative strength of the us economy seemed to have diminished conditions in us shortterm funding markets remained orderly secured market rates increased early in the period retracing the decline following the technical adjustment in the on rrp rate in december before declining later in the period treasury bill supply began contracting in late february and was expected to decline further until the resolution of the federal debt limit situation the accompanying drawdown in the tga was expected to boost on rrp takeup and reserves putting downward pressure on secured market rates early signs of these dynamics were evident over the latter half of the period borrowing costs for households businesses and municipalities declined rates on year fixedrate conforming residential mortgages declined in line with the year treasury yield interest rates for newly originated commercial and industrial ci loans moved down a bit in the fourth quarter but remained elevated relative to their historical distribution yields on newly issued agency and non agency commercial mortgagebacked securities cmbs decreased but stayed somewhat above historical standards while interest rates on existing credit card accounts remained elevated they fell noticeably in the fourth quarter reflecting the declines in the prime rate since the september fomc meeting auto loan rates also fell last quarter but retraced some of those declines early this year financing from capital markets continued to be broadly available for largetomidsize businesses and municipalities following subdued corporate bond issuance in december gross issuance was solid in january and february bank credit appeared to have become somewhat more available to large businesses ci loan balances at large domestic banks continued to grow modestly through mid february by contrast credit conditions for small businesses remained moderately tight multiple recent surveys including the senior loan officer opinion survey on bank lending practices and the kansas city feds small business lending survey suggested that lending standards had remained relatively tight for small businesses through december commercial real estate cre loan growth accelerated through midfebruary after remaining subdued in the second half of last year as growth in nonfarm nonresidential loans was strong credit continued to be easily available for highcreditscore mortgage borrowers mortgage credit availability for lowercreditscore borrowers continued to tighten slightly consumer credit remained generally available minutes of the federal open market committee credit quality remained solid for largetomidsize firms municipalities and most home mortgage borrowers but it continued to deteriorate in other sectors the credit performance of corporate bonds had been generally stable recently and the performance of leveraged loans deteriorated slightly but remained solid overall at banks delinquency rates on ci loans edged up in the fourth quarter but stayed just above the middle of the range observed over the past decade meanwhile delinquency rates for short and longterm small business loans and for small business credit cards ticked down in december but remained above prepandemic levels credit quality in the cre market deteriorated in the fourth quarter partly driven by multifamily loans more recently however cmbs delinquency rates declined in january and february particularly among office building loans the shortterm delinquency rate on federal housing administration mortgages inched down in january but remained elevated relative to the past few years delinquency rates on most other types of home mortgages stayed low delinquency rates on credit cards fell substantially in the fourth quarter their largest decline since the second quarter of but they remained at elevated levels staff economic outlook the staff projection for real gdp growth was weaker than the one prepared for the january meeting as incoming data for aggregate spending were below expectations and the support from financial conditions had lessened the unemployment rate was forecast to edge up but remain close to the staffs estimate of its natural rate the staff made no material changes to the placeholder assumptions for potential policies that were used for the previous baseline forecast and continued to note elevated uncertainty regarding the scope timing and potential economic effects of possible changes to trade immigration fiscal and regulatory policies the staff continued to highlight the difficulty of assessing the importance of such factors for the baseline projection and had prepared a number of alternative scenarios the staffs inflation projection was a little higher for this year than the one prepared for the previous meeting primarily reflecting higherthanexpected incoming data inflation in was forecast to be somewhat above the rate posted last year mostly because the expected effects of the staffs placeholder assumption for trade policy put upward pressure on inflation this year after that inflation was projected to decline to percent by the staff assessed that the uncertainty around their baseline projection had increased but continued to view the uncertainty around the forecast as similar to the average over the past years a period that saw a number of episodes during which uncertainty about the economy and federal policy changes was elevated the staff judged that the risks around the baseline projections for economic activity and employment had tilted to the downside as data on aggregate spending and financial conditions had come in somewhat weaker than expected and a number of indicators of household march business and financial market participant sentiment had turned downbeat the risks around the baseline projection for inflation were still seen as skewed to the upside because core inflation had not come down as much as expected last year and because changes to trade policy could put more upward pressure on inflation than the staff had assumed participants views on current conditions and the economic outlook in conjunction with this fomc meeting participants submitted their projections of the most likely outcomes for real gdp growth the unemployment rate and inflation for each year from through and over the longer run the projections were based on participants individual assessments of appropriate monetary policy including their projections of the federal funds rate the longerrun projections represented each participants assessment of the rate to which each variable would tend to converge under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy participants also provided their individual assessments of the level of uncertainty and the balance of risks associated with their projections the summary of economic projections was released to the public after the meeting participants observed that available data pointed to an economy that continued to grow at a solid pace and labor market conditions that remained broadly balanced but that inflation stayed somewhat elevated participants generally noted the high degree of uncertainty facing the economy information from participants business contacts and from many surveys indicated some deterioration in household and business sentiment amid heightened uncertainty about government policies various participants commented that high uncertainty had the potential to damp consumer spending as well as business hiring and investment activities or that inflation was likely to be boosted by increased tariffs as a result participants generally saw increased downside risks to employment and economic growth and upside risks to inflation while indicating that high uncertainty surrounded their economic outlooks in their discussion of inflation developments participants noted that inflation had eased significantly over the past two years but remained somewhat elevated relative to the committees percent longerrun goal some participants observed that inflation data over the first two months of this year were higher than they had expected among the major subcategories of prices housing services inflation had continued to moderate consistent with the past slowing in market rents but inflation in core nonhousing services remained high especially in nonmarket services some participants highlighted that core goods inflation had increased and most of them noted that these increases might reflect the effects of the anticipation of higher tariffs with regard to the outlook for inflation participants judged that inflation was likely to be boosted this year by the effects of higher tariffs although significant uncertainty surrounded the magnitude and minutes of the federal open market committee persistence of such effects several participants noted that the announced or planned tariff increases were larger and broader than many of their business contacts had expected several participants also noted that their contacts were already reporting increases in costs possibly in anticipation of rising tariffs or that their contacts had indicated willingness to pass on to consumers higher input costs that would arise from potential tariff increases a couple of participants highlighted factors that might limit the inflationary effects of tariffs noting that many households had depleted the excess savings they had accumulated during the pandemic and were less likely to accept additional price increases or that stricter immigration policies might reduce demand for rental and affordable housing and alleviate upward pressures on housing inflation a couple of participants noted that the continued balance in the labor market suggested that labor market conditions were unlikely to be a source of inflationary pressure a couple of participants noted that in the period ahead it could be especially difficult to distinguish between relatively persistent changes in inflation and more temporary changes that might be associated with the introduction of tariffs participants commented on a range of factors that could influence the persistence of tariff effects including the extent to which tariffs are imposed on intermediate goods and thus affect input costs at various stages of production the extent to which complex supply chains need to be restructured the actions of trading partners in responding with retaliatory increases in tariffs and the stability of longerterm inflation expectations almost all participants pointed out that many market or surveybased measures of nearterm expected inflation had increased recently participants generally noted that most measures of longer term expected inflation remained well anchored a factor likely to put downward pressure on inflation several participants emphasized that ensuring that longerterm inflation expectations remained anchored would enhance the committees ability to achieve its pricestability goal participants judged that labor market conditions remained broadly in balance the unemployment rate had stabilized at a relatively low level and nominal wage growth continued to moderate average payroll employment growth while slowing some recently remained solid several participants highlighted recent increases in businesses layoff announcements and in people working part time for economic reasons a majority of participants commented that the recent cuts in federal government jobs and to federal funding had begun to affect employment at federal contractors universities hospitals municipalities and nonprofit organizations with many organizations that rely on government contracts having reported layoffs or pauses in their hiring plans in addition many participants noted that their contacts and business survey respondents reported pausing hiring decisions because of elevated policy uncertainty several participants relayed reports from contacts who were concerned that restrictive immigration policies would reduce labor supply and put upward pressure on wages in certain sectors march participants observed that the available data suggested that the economy had continued to grow at a solid pace but that there were some indications that consumer spending growth might be moderating from its rapid pace over the previous two quarters several participants commented that the mixed retail sales data in january and february were consistent with consumption continuing to grow at a positive yet slower pace several participants noted that the recent downgrade in earnings forecasts from retailers and airline companies pointed to weaker consumer demand from both lower and higherincome households participants commented on a number of factors that could restrain consumption including weaker consumer sentiment and deteriorations in expected household financial situations as indicated by a number of household surveys and anticipation that the robust labor income growth and significant increases in asset prices over the previous several years might not continue by contrast a few participants noted that consumption spending could continue to be supported by solid growth in real personal disposable income or by a rebound in equity prices with regard to the business sector most participants commented that contacts or surveys reported increased uncertainty about potential changes in federal government policies and a deterioration in business sentiment which had led many firms to pause their capital spending plans several participants highlighted that the auto industry faced significant risks associated with tariffs because of its interconnected and crossborder supply chains by contrast several participants noted that their contacts expressed optimism about future firm profitability driven by more businessfriendly regulatory or fiscal policy changes or expected productivity gains from artificial intelligence and related technologies a few participants highlighted the strains faced by the agricultural sector as tariffs threatened to further compress its profit margins by lowering farm export prices and raising input costs some participants noted that financial conditions had tightened since the january meeting reflecting lower equity prices and higher risk spreads on corporate bonds but most of them commented that risk premiums in bond and equity markets remained low by historical standards or that businesses and consumers with higher credit scores continued to be able to obtain financing a few participants cautioned that an abrupt repricing of risk in financial markets could exacerbate the effects of any negative shocks to the economy in their consideration of monetary policy at this meeting participants noted that inflation remained somewhat elevated participants also observed that recent indicators suggested that economic activity had continued to expand at a solid pace that the unemployment rate had stabilized at a low level and that labor market conditions had remained solid in recent months in this context and amid elevated uncertainty around the economic outlook all participants viewed it as appropriate to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at to percent minutes of the federal open market committee in discussing the outlook for monetary policy participants remarked that uncertainty about the net effect of an array of government policies on the economic outlook was high making it appropriate to take a cautious approach emphasizing that uncertainty a majority of participants noted the potential for inflationary effects arising from various factors to be more persistent than they projected with economic growth and the labor market still solid and current monetary policy restrictive participants assessed that the committee was well positioned to wait for more clarity on the outlook for inflation and economic activity participants noted that policy decisions were not on a preset course and would be informed by the evolution of the economy the economic outlook and the balance of risks in discussing riskmanagement considerations that could bear on the outlook for monetary policy participants assessed that uncertainty around the economic outlook had increased with almost all participants viewing risks to inflation as tilted to the upside and risks to employment as tilted to the downside participants remarked that monetary policy was well positioned to address future developments a restrictive policy could be maintained for longer if inflation were to remain elevated and policy could be eased if labor market conditions were to deteriorate or economic activity were to weaken some participants observed however that the committee may face difficult tradeoffs if inflation proved to be more persistent while the outlook for growth and employment weakened several participants emphasized that elevated inflation could prove to be more persistent than expected participants assessed that balance sheet reduction had gone well thus far all participants judged it appropriate to continue the process of reducing the federal reserves securities holdings almost all participants supported a slowing of the pace of runoff at this meeting most participants noted the importance of clearly communicating that slowing the runoff pace had no implications for the stance of monetary policy would not affect the longterm path of the balance sheet was a natural progression of the slowing decided at the may meeting and was in line with the committees principles and plans for balance sheet reduction announced in some participants noted that a slower pace of runoff would also help guard against reserve scarcity emerging with little advance notice during a period of potentially rapid increase in the tga several participants did not see a compelling case for slowing the pace of runoff at this meeting a number of participants commented that the committees existing tools could also be used to help address potential disruptions to the market for reserves some participants highlighted the importance of the federal reserves ceiling tools and encouraged the ongoing efforts of the desk to improve the efficacy of the standing repo facility several participants observed that the federal reserves traditional tool of open market operations could also be used should signs of reserve scarcity unexpectedly emerge many participants expressed interest in continued discussion of technical aspects of balance sheet policy and tools after the framework review is completed march

unemployment rate had stabilized at a low level in recent months and labor market conditions had remained solid members concurred that inflation remained somewhat elevated members assessed that uncertainty around the economic outlook had increased and agreed that they were attentive to the risks to both sides of the committees dual mandate in support of its goals the committee agreed to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at to percent members agreed that in considering the extent and timing of additional adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate the committee would carefully assess incoming data the evolving outlook and the balance of risks almost all members agreed to reducing the committees securities holdings at a slower pace with the monthly redemption cap on treasury securities reduced from billion to billion and the monthly redemption cap on agency debt and agency mortgagebacked securities maintained at billion one member agreed with the committees decision to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at to percent but voted against the overall decision because he preferred to continue the pace of decline in securities holdings in place at the time of the vote all members agreed that the postmeeting statement should affirm their strong commitment both to supporting maximum employment and to returning inflation to the committees percent objective members agreed that in assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy the committee would continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook they would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerged that could impede the attainment of the committees goals members also agreed that their assessments would take into account a wide range of information including readings on labor market conditions inflation pressures and inflation expectations and financial and international developments at the conclusion of the discussion the committee voted to direct the federal reserve bank of new york until instructed otherwise to execute transactions in the soma in accordance with

and agency mortgagebacked securities mbs received in each calendar month that exceeds a cap of billion per month into treasury securities to roughly match the maturity composition of treasury securities outstanding allow modest deviations from stated amounts for reinvestments if needed for operational reasons the vote also encompassed approval of the statement below for release at pm

collins lisa d cook austan d goolsbee philip n jefferson adriana d kugler alberto g musalem and jeffrey r schmid voting against this action christopher j waller governor waller preferred no change in the federal funds target range and continuing the pace of decline in securities holdings in place at the time of the vote this view was based on reserve balances being over trillion as well as no evidence from money market indicators or his outreach conversations that the banking system is getting close to an ample level of reserves in addition rather than changing the pace of balance sheet reduction he thought the federal reserve should rely on its existing tools and develop a plan for how to respond to shortrun strains if they emerge consistent with the committees decision to leave the target range for the federal funds rate unchanged the board of governors of the federal reserve system voted unanimously to maintain the interest rate paid on reserve balances at percent effective
